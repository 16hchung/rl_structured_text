 Are there any restrictions? I'm a big proponent that books are allowed on public display in public areas of the country but they must have an acceptable age for display. I believe the government is doing an excellent work and that they should remove books from the shelf.

The book-sellin' crowd is trying very diligently, trying to convince people that they are doing a job and they can go on doing whatever. They don't want people thinking that their book should have been sold in stores, that they should not buy books. The fact that people are trying is that it makes people think they have a job to get their book to a shelf that's actually there and not there, and it is not going anywhere because they're being told by the authorities, the police that the books they are trying to sell will be confiscated and that they are going on their own and they have a duty and responsibility to protect people and they are being told to do that. They're being forced by people in government to go on the streets and do their jobs.
