In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some peoples religion and way of life.     I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?      There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.     I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.     There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do?

My views on censorship in libraries are alike in many different ways.     Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive to more than just one person.  If they are not that big of a problem they shouldn't be removed.       People might change their mind about going to that particular library, if they find a lot of offensive things there.  Also having these offensive things in libraries greatens the chance they could be read by the wrong minds, and it could possibly change how most children act, or think.  A few things that I would find, that would bother me are books or magazines that contain drugs, nudity, horrible violence, and bullying.     From my own experience, having books that contain these types of problems are very offensive to most parents and can effect the way you live, if you take them seriously.  Some libraries don't even realize that they have these offensive books, magazines, or videos.  I have had a teacher take a book away from me and I got in trouble for reading it, even though it was in the library where anyone could have grabbed it off the shelf and read it.  In my opinion I think libraries should take the time and look through the books they have and decide whether or not they  are considered offensive to parents if their children were to read them.     I agree with removing certain materials that contain offensive things, from all libraries.  Also I believe if parents could choose they would decide to get rid of all the mean, nasty, and offensive materials

@NUM1ed     The censorship of certain media is such a controversial topic. Whether a certain piece of material is considered offensive and should be censored or not is more often opinionated rather than logically opposed, because it really does all come down to someone's opinion on this matter. It is too difficult for most people to step in someone else's shoes or be persuaded from a viewpoint different from their own or even escape pressures from the general public to consider something else. Things get censored for a lot of reasons, too! Sometimes they're just so intentionally offensive that perhaps the author or producer wants it to be censored or would appreciate the controversy, or that a new view or opinion is so radical and against a majority of the population that it is just considered offensive for being so different. Well, when does someone have a right to take a song off the air or pull a book permanently from a shelf?     The first thing that needs to be contemplated is if something is offensive or not. There are extremes to pieces of media where one sometimes must ask, '@CAPS1 were they thinking when they made that?' A movie being so outrageously graphic or violent is a fine example (although the same thing can happen in books, just with words instead of pictures). At the same time though, whether or not something you might think as unnecessary gore in a film might just be @CAPS1 I'm excited to see when I go to the cinema - it's all opinionated!          Another interesting thought is that somebody might come up with a revolutionary, radical scientific theory and write a whole novel or film a documentary explaining it all, but certain groups of people might claim that it is offensive to them. However, we might investigate into that theory ourselves and not be offended in the slightest. This is understandable though, people grow up in an environment that has its own set of ethics and principles, and people will honestly believe them and probably stick with those fundamentals throughout their lifetime. If you go against someone's beliefs that they hold so dear like that, they would of course be offensive to them. Does that mean that the something should be censored just because it offends a couple of groups in a population?     Whether or not something is to be torn from the access of the public is left up to the opinions of the general public themselves. The opinion of the public is created by the current time, trends, ethics, and problems that are going on. When something goes against too many of those things, people get upset. If most people are upset by something, it will probably start disappearing from sight. It's bad for business, and libraries are losing customers already due to most people not having an urge to read anymore with all of the stuff that you can do otherwise. Certain things can just put a bad taste in your mouth, and if someone gets that too often when they go to a library, they probably won't go there anymore.     So when it comes down to censorship in libraries, or anywhere, its just a bunch of opinions. If the general public does not like something, it will stop showing up. Certain books or other pieces of media are asking for the controversy that many subjects bring, while others are just unintentionally going against certain groups of people. People's beliefs are determined by where they grew up and when, and they'll hold on to those things for their lifetime. If something goes against those, people will be offended, and if enough people are upset, it gets taken away

Censorship, @CAPS1 or @CAPS2?          I can understand why libraries would decide to keep certain books off their shelves. Libraries are a place for learning and work. If you were sitting near someone at a public library who was reading smut you could feel awkward.      Although some people @MONTH1 find certain items unoffensive, other @MONTH1 disagree. Imagine you are a mother with a young child who decided to wonder through the library. Your child finds a magazine. It's '@CAPS3'. Not something that you are going to want to explain to your child. If the library were to have not kept the magazine, it never would have happened. Libraries are a public place that should be taken seriously.    If people really want to find something that is inappropriate they can find it somewhere else. The modern world today makes it easy for people to find just about anything without a large hassle. Therefore it should be fine to keep certain materials out of our libraries.      How can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books, or books with rude language, and scandalous themes. If you are trying to get work done or learn and there are distracting items on the shelves then it @MONTH1 make things more difficult. Libraries are serious places and should be treated as such.

To start, if any materials in the library such as books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive i believe that they should still remain on the shelves. This book or music @MONTH1 be offensive but everyone is intitled to their own opinon. People have all the freedom to read, listen or watch anything that is approperite to them. I believe it should all be up to the individual to chose what they should do with what @MONTH1 offend others.      Also from my own exprience i have read a book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in the stadges of our history where they were salves and were hung for their punishment. It @MONTH1 offend some that their local library having a book on such a terrible topic but it is found that it is part of history and others @MONTH1 find it interesting to go back a learn more information. It does not have to mean that they are rascist or trying to offend you they would just like to learn more about our history. Each person has had topics that offend them but the libraries can not make all happy. If you chose to pick a book, watch a movie, or listen to music that @MONTH1 offend someone then it shouldn't be removed, if you would like to read, watch or listen to anything that @MONTH1 offend someone then it should be up to you to decide what to do about it.        Therefore, i conclude that if any books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive they should remain on the shelves. Everyone @MONTH1 have their own opinon or have their own ideals that offend them but it is our job to let those people choose their liking of anything open in our local libraries. It is for their own benifit, not for yours. It is up to you to decide wheather or not to come about the situation. Libraries should not be held responsable and have to removed anything open to the people that @MONTH1 just be part of our background

Should books, music, etc; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? well people have the right to look at what they want, to hear what they want. Some think its not right to have offensive things out in the open on the shelves.Some people think its alright. I gusse it all just depends on that person and thier feelings.      Lets say i was in the library and i did see  something offensive. well the world does not stop and say ''hey look at that @ORGANIZATION1 finds that offensive so lets take that off the shelves just to please her''.  Am sorry but thats not how life works. If you dont like looking at it then turn the  other way. If it were me i would be worried about more important things such as war or things going  on in my life other then something offensive on the book shelves.     Its a big world out there and it is not getting any smaller and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. There are going to be things in life we the people dont like to look at, to maybe hear thats offensive. Heres what i say to it, get over it .          The other  day i was at the bait shop and i heared a word that  i dare not to even  say and i hate hearing that word. What was i going to do tell a grown man to not say that?...... I just  rolled my eyes and went on about my  buisness.          Should books, music, ect; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? well like ive  been saying this whole time, in live there are going to be certain things that are offensive to you. You have to get over it . Sometimes geting over offensive things that you see are not easy but hey lifes not  easy

In Katherine Paterson's writing she tells us that she does not want her child to pick up a book off the shelf that could be found offensive. But I think that there should be sections of the library that are cut off away from the public eye, but are still there for those certin people.     If my child were to pick up a book that was not for his/or her age group I would not get made, because I know that some of the book groups are close to others them some, but they are for everyone to see, which could be offensive to some. I would tell my son/ or daughter that that book is not for you, and we would go and pick out a new book to read.     Over all I think that there should be sections of the library that are made for a certin age group, and should not be seen by kids. Because once I was that little kid, and went wondering through the miles of shelfs to find a really wonderful book to read, but long behold that didn't happen, I had wondered along to find a book that was not in my age group.     So I think that there needs to be more careful eyes in the library staff to make sure that those kind of things will never happen again.

What is appropriate in libraries these days? The opinions differ throughout the variety of different people across @LOCATION1.  Censorship has taken a turn in public libraries, but still has been strictly forbidden from school libraries. Personally, I think that there is a difference between vulger and inappropriate items in a public library versus a school library.      A public library is a place for anyone and anywhere to come and find an item that they are interested in. As we all know, everyone is different and have their own interests, so they should be able to find the book, music, etc. for them. The problem is, how do the libraries keep these uncensored objects out of children's hands? The answer should be simple. For thought, maybe all public libraries should be broken up into sections, each with their own subject matter. These different sections could include Children's, @CAPS1, and many more different titles. This set up is often used in well known book stores and libraries such as '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' and '@CAPS4'.  Overall, censorship in public libraries does not need to be as strict as school libraries.     School libraries are a whole different idea. School libraries are made to help assist the students' academic acheivement, nothing more and nothing less. However, I also think that the content in the school libraries also depends on the maturity of the students. For example, elementary and middle school libraries should have a stricter censorship than high school libraries. The students in high school should be mature enough to handle uncensored material without creating a huge scene, like we all know younger students would do. I have personally seen and witnessed a few so called 'inappropriate' books on the shelf at my high school library, but the readers of the book have been mature about reading it. I believe that some offensive and vulger items can be interesting and educational. It is all a part of growing up.          The censorship in our libraries today vary from each library to the next. School libraries and public libraries are completely different places of literate and media content. I think that it is a person's own personal decision dealing with which library they go to. If a family with young children want to go to the library, the parents need to choose the appropriate areas in the building to search for the children. Therefore, there should be no problem in running across a 'bad' book. The author, @PERSON1, states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf... And then we have no books left on the shelf for anyone.

I do not think that they should be taken off of the shelf because some people find it offensive. The way i look at it is, is that everyone has their own beliefs and rights their own opinions. Not everyone is going to think alike.     As an example some people are against blacks and others are not. Everyone thinks different and have their own opinions therefore, they should all be able to listen to whatever.      Not everyone is going to like what you like and listen and believe everything you do. Don't read it if it offends you, but just cause it offends you doens't mean that someone else out there doesn't believe in it or likes it.

Cencorship     The topic I am going to discuss today is censorship. Do you think that censorship is a good thing or a bad thing? I am going to list a couple of ways that i think censorship is bad and also why it is good.     The first thing I am going to talk to you about is how it is bad. The bad part about censorship is that it can offend people very easily. Most people can handle alot of abuse, but on the otherhand alot of people can't.      In my oppinion I think that it is fine to have some things out that offend people because that is how alot of people find humor. Such as political cartoon. They make fun of the @CAPS1 and alot of the other people that are in office, but you dont see them complaining about it. In my oppinion if you dont like it then dont read it. That is all you have to do and then it will never bother you again.     But on the other hand i can see how some people can get offended. Because some of the things are very mean in books and movies. I think that there should be some type of line that seperates going to fare and what is good enough. most people can live with it, but others can't. Such as @CAPS2, there is a whole lot of @CAPS2 in the @LOCATION1, and expecally in this time period. where ever you go there is always some sort of @CAPS2.     In conclusion I think that people need to get together and create a line that can be drawn befor they get to far. and some of the stuff now needs to be taking off of the shelves, but not everything

Dear @CAPS1 paper,     I for one do think that certain books should be removed from the book shelves at the libraries, but I also disagree with that same situation as well.  For example, I believe that certain books shoud be removed from the library shelves because, under age children also attend the library, and because, other people might find certain books offensive and should not be displaed in a library. My disagreement to the situation is that the its a library, and libraries have different types of books.          First, I think that certain books should be removed from the library because, it a public library and not only adults attend that library, but under age children as well. I know that certain books under age children are not allowed to check out, but they are not deprivcd of their privlliages of staying in the library reading such books.          Next, I do not agree that cerain books should be viewed on library shelves because, other people might find such a book offensive to be in a library. The reson I say this is because some books oppose humor to other people race, and if for say a black, mexican, maybe even a arbiana person was to come in the library looking for a book and happen to fall upon a book that talks about their race, most people would take that offensive.          However, I do not think that any book being deprived from a libray. My reason for thinking that is simply because its a library, and libraries are developed for many peole types of intrest in books. And I don't think it will be fair that certain books should be removed from the library because people think they are inappropraite in certain people interest in books. And people should be free to come in and look at books without having to search for books that interest them but are removed because other people find them offensive.          Therefore, I do and also don't agree that a library should be stripped of a book becuase it lacks intrest in someone or offend someone. And that such a person should 'put the shoe on the other foot' as the saying goes and try to see from other people point of view.

There are many materials in libraries that are offcensive to certain people. I don't think they should be taken off the shelves but I do believe they should be put into a different section in the library.      Almost every thing in life offends someone in one way or another. It @MONTH1 be as little as 'blonde jokes' or as major as saying something about someone's sexuallity. I know little kids wouldnt understand those types of things but parents can't keep their kids hidden away forever.     If someone says something about someone else, then I do believe it's wrong. I mean think about how many 'blonde jokes' there are. A lot of blondes I know, don't take those jokes seriously. One of my good friends is a natural blonde and she is probably the smartest blonde I have ever met. Whenever she hears a blonde joke she laughs and say something funny to go with it.    Probably one of the most major things that people get offended by is politics or someones sexuallity. Politics create huge problems for people who don't think something should be one way and then if the governer turns around and says something and someone else will take it way to serious. Many people who have are different because they dont like who they are 'suppose' to like are always offended by someone in some shape or form. It's not like parents can keep us away from it forever. Little kids become teenagers, teenagers because young adults who eventually become adults. People should learn how to deal with different struggles in life.      So in conclusion, if a parent doesn't want to expose their child to things they thing is offensive then good for them but other people like to learn about the things that people find offensive and that create problems in the @LOCATION1. I believe that by leaving the books, movies and magazines on the shelves in a seperate area of the library isn't a bad idea. Think about it, if you take books away from people who want to learn about the different things and want to know why people get offended, wouldn't they feel offended too because you took that away from them

You gotta admit, although you would like your kids to have freedom, @CAPS3 all of them are responsible enough to handle @CAPS1. You could blabber in their ear all day about '@CAPS1's responsible to do this and @CAPS3 do this.' and they will go out and do @CAPS1 anyways. Trust me, I'm a teenager. I know. So there are certin things that you have to take away from them in order to keep them from getting distracted on what @CAPS2 matters in their teenage years. And that is schoolwork.     If school systems allowed there to be offensive or innapropriate materials on their shelves, I just know kids would find themselves to be...well... 'distracted'. And when I say innapropriate, I don't only mean on sexual terms, I mean for school. You would like to think that they would possibly save @CAPS1 for when they checked out and went home and did their work first but, like I stated before, kids are going to do what they want. And what they want to do is @PERCENT1 of the time @CAPS3 schoolwork. They would rather just sit down, crack open a magazine, and let their eyes glaze over at the sights of celebrities and new scandals.      School work is a very important thing in teenagers lives, and I feel that when they are in school they should stay focused on schoolwork and activities. If they wanted to have free time to go and read magazines, they should do @CAPS1 at home. Offensive books should @CAPS3 be there to only distract the teenager from school. @CAPS1's unneccesary. But with public libraries, @CAPS1's a whole new story.     I beleive that nothing should be censored from a public library because people go their on their own free will. I know I personaly go there for research and for the sheer joy of reading, as do many other people. @CAPS1's your choice if you are responsible enough to keep focused on work or get distracted because @CAPS3 only do teenagers go there, but adults do too. @CAPS1 is unacceptable for there to be only educational books because who knows what your there for? The library is for people to go and read, whether @CAPS1's just for the heck of @CAPS1 or for school.     @CAPS3 everyone is responsible. Especially @CAPS3 teenagers. So that's why I personally beleive offensive or innapropriate materials should @CAPS3 be allowed in school libraries, but allwowed in public libraries. Although equal rights and freedom in necessary, schoolwork is too important to let kids get distracted from @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is the key to their future

I believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries. There are some books out there that could be a little offensive and cause some problems, but I also believe that even if a book is insulting you shouldn't be able to hide it from others.     There are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library. Since a library is public lots of people go in to get books. What is to stop a kid to getting to one of these books, or movies you can find in libraries? Do you really want a child to check something out that has violence, horrible language, and sexual innuedo? What can you do about this problem? You could censorship the books and hide them from the public, but that would cause another problem.     The idea of censorship might sound ok, but really it's not the right thing to do. Hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a little over the top. If you are an adult and your in the mood to read something with a little violence in it you'd have to go somewhere else because someone just took that book away because it had some swear words that they don't find appropriate in books. Censorship would just make it harder for adults to find some books that they would want to read.     So what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf? Do you just leave it there, or take it away so no one can read it? You could just put age restrictions on the books. If someone underage wanted to check out the book, they would have to get permission from their parent. That way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone

People all around the world think differently about music, books, and movies. Some think that books and music should have different kinds of ratings. Some people think that a song should be rated '@CAPS1' for mature when others could think that it shouldn't have any rating at all. Level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for. Level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into.      If everyone could pull off a book or magazine, etc then there would be no books left. This is why we have levels of maturty on the material. Levels are letters, such as '@CAPS1' for mature. '@CAPS1' means that their will probably be some naked and sexual play into the video or song. With this on their it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it they can take it away. This leaves the parent with some control over what kids can watch and hear.     Stores won't let kids under the age of @NUM1 buy a rated @CAPS4 movie. Rated @CAPS4 stands for sexual act, language, and blood. It can stand for more things such as drugs. I am happy that my nine year old can't buy a rated @CAPS4 movie, but senice the law says a @NUM1 year old kid should be aloud to watch it, then its saying they should be mature enough to see or hear it.     We should be happy that we can have some control over what are children watch and listen too. We could try getting rid of all bad books, movies etc, but over time I'@CAPS1 sure more will be made. I am also sure that over time we will find a old copy of a book on a website. We cannot save our kids their whole life, so over time we have got to let them grow up. Our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch. We just have to raise them the best we can.

Corrupt Censorship     @CAPS1 @MONTH1 occur when censorship decides to remove or block; showing certain media or readable content all pertains to the creator. In some cases, the distributor and less the author, director, or publisher, has no opinion on whether to display the product they have made, but from their own habit of making what they enjoy; it is the will from the store, person or etc. to display these materials. Libraries have an exponential option to publicly put up on their shelves or stock, but restricting too graphic material is all depended on the eduacational rules the library is equipted with.          Any type of content is art, art that should never be even considered to be changed or enhanced because it pertains to one artist. You can never remake, rewrite or recreate that visual material provided from the creator. And you are not aloud to, unless given permission to from the creator. Censoring or removing on the other hand, is permitted to the distributor. Their choice to publicly demonstrate something made by someone is all their choice.     Libraries for example, show that any given media or readable content is publicly displayed for anyone to see, so long as the audience fits their rules or criterias. In some instances, partial side of the audience will run across unexpected media and will have the inexecptional pursuasion to accept what is demonstrated. Though it is not the creators fault to ensure where their content is diplayed, but the audience's fault in whether to see that material. It is choice to read or see whatever you'd like, you aren't forced upon to follow through to what the distributor-let alone the creator- is offering. Enjoying the topic or material is optional.   When you have options in front of you, any given topics or subject to read or follow, it it your will to chose to read or see them. Enjoying is even more harder, but when a library's limit is basically the sky, you should not force it on them to throw out the book just because the censorship isnt up to your level. It is not the library to blame, but your own. Everyone has different views on certain content and it isnt your obligation to view it.      When you take down materials @CAPS2 intended for those who chose to view and enjoy, you destroy not @CAPS2 art a creator has made, but the joy that filled a viewers taste. Libraries shouldnt exceptionalize for certain people's expectations because not everyone finds censorship a solution. Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so deos everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'

Throughout time, fellow people have struggled to censor or ban material that they consider offensive. It @MONTH1 be the way they were brought up, or simply what they beleive. I do not beleive that it should be up to anyone to say what should and should not be censored for anyone but themselves. Everyone has one life, and in this one life we create our personal oppinions and beliefs on what is wrong and what is right. We are completely unaware of many people throughout our life cycles, and saying what should be banned from everybody is almost claiming you know the morals, beliefs, and customs of everyone in the world.     If I came to school one day and brought a book that contained material that I think is relevant and not just pure exploitation, then I should be able to read that as long as I don't influence others by their own will. Let's say another student sees me reading that same book and he has grown up in a household that taught him that the situations and material in my book are overly offensive, I do not think he should be able to create a ban of this book just because of his own upbringing. There is such a thing as mass agreement, but there is also a thing called mass ignorance, and to say that I know what should and should not be shown to other people is completely ignorant on my part.      I think the only allowance of censorship should be from parent to child. That is the only situation that someone should be allowed authority over someone else, because they have undeniable duties as parents, and they be able to say what is right knowing they are creating a child to think what is wrong and what is right in their mind

Have you ever been offended? Did you lash out, or did you keep an open mind and come try understanding? People are offended by many things every day in life. So, we should broaden our minds, and see these 'offenses' as a normality.     You're at a party with a bowl full of candy stationed right beside the front door. You walk in and take a piece. Wait, you don't want that piece? What are you going to do with it? Do you take all of the same pieces that you don't like out of the bowl and throw them away, or do you simply drop it back into the bowl and choose a new one? If you throw the candy away, what does that mean for the other party guests? You have narrowed their choices down because of your own selfish opinion. That candy could have been the guest favorite. But, since YOU don't like it, you take away the other guests' privilege to eat that candy. They didn't deserve that, now did they?     If you're searching through books in a library and you come across a book that doesn't interest you or offends you, then put it back and look for a new one. If you're having trouble finding the right book, ask the librarian for suggestions on other topics or books to check out. Go to a new library, even, but don't mess with something that isn't yours. Especially, something as small as a book.     The point of the matter is, if you don't like something then disregard it. The moment the book, and the book alone, starts causing problems is the moment anyone should intervene. But, come on, do you really think a book could cause a problem? If your child is having problems, don't you think you ought to check what's going on with him instead of looking to see if he/she checked out the 'book that we hope none of our children' took off the shelf. This is quite possibly one of the last things I would think of causing a problem, if I even thought of this at all. Opinions can cause a lot of problems. Sometimes, people just need to keep their opinions to themselves, agreed?

I do not think that there is a need to remove offensive materials from libraries. Some people @MONTH1 find these things offensive, but I think that others will be greatly offended if they remove these things.      Take rap music for example. There are many people that think that the lyrics of those  songs are just terrible and offensive. Other people think that rap music is amazing. I do not think rap is very good at all, but I would not go the extent of saying that rap songs should not be played on the radio, and that the @CAPS1 should not be sold in stores. The same thing could be said for these materials in the library. Some @MONTH1 find them offensive but others greatly apreciate it.     Some people @MONTH1 be interested in these topics. Just like some people @MONTH1 be interested in fantasy or comedy. It would not be  fair for libraries to remove these materails from the library, and deny the people that do like them the rite to rent these materials.     Another factors is the maturity of the reader. If the person who is reading book or viewing movies that @MONTH1 be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then is no problem with it. But if the reader is not reading for interest, then there is a problem there. It all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library. The materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them. Just because someone else @MONTH1 find those materials offensive is no reasons to take them off the shelf.     I can see why some parents @MONTH1 be upset that their kids @MONTH1 see some of the things in the library that @MONTH1 not be apropriate, but all the libraries that I have been to have a had a special area for kids materials. If the parents where woried about their kids seing some the questionable materials they could bring the kid to that area.     I dont think that these materials that @MONTH1 seem offensive to some people should be removed from libraries. Everyone is going to be affended by something and it is not fare to deprive others of those materials even it is offensive to some.

If materials are offensive they should not be displayed. Offensive materials can have big effects on children younger than at least ten years of age. I believe that if materials at a library are found offensive and proved to be offensive, then they should be removed.     Materials at libraries are not for everyone. A lot of it is especially not for young children. For example: @CAPS1 could be a young child wanting to check-out a movie that looks interesting  to him/her. The movie could be rated @NUM1 but the parents still check it out for them. Once they watch the movie, it @MONTH1 have some heavy language, sex-related humor or content. Then the child is learning and seeing all of this hapening in a motion picture. Also if they have nervous parents, the library could get some calls. Today, a lot of younger children about @NUM2+ have seen, watched, or read something that had profanity in it or inapropriate conduct in it.     People have read some of the material that the library has and spotted some profanity not knowing it was in @CAPS1. If a religious man/woman checked out a book or a magazine from the library and spotted the profanity they put in a lot of these books and magazines, it would absolutely bother them. If they won't take them off of the shelves, the least they can do is keep a list of all of the materials that have heavy profanity, sex, and strong violence in them. They should do that so they can warn the person who is checking out the material.     With all of the nasty things that are seen in books, movies, magazines, etc., people need to be alerted to what they read and watch. Some of the books can get pretty nasty and terrible with all of the things they say. Library materials must be checked. If they are found offensive, and proved offensive, they should be moved.

Have you ever been in a library and thought to yourself, 'hey, this book looks pretty good.' But once you read @CAPS3, you deamed @CAPS3 as innoproprate for younger people? I have, but unlike some people, I don't blame @CAPS3 on the libraries. I blame myself for picking @CAPS3 up in the first place. Some people do not want to take the responsibility for their actions, and so they blame @CAPS3 on the library for carrying a certain author's books, a band's songs, or a magazine's articles.     This brings me to say that books, music, magazines, newspapers, etc. should not be taken off of the shelves of libraries. Just because some people do not like the content that they hold, doesn't mean that @CAPS3 can't be helpful or entertaining to others. I think @CAPS3 should be a matter of choice, like choosing which outfit you want to wear in the @TIME1. There are  too many options, like when @CAPS3 comes to the books, movies, music, and magazines. If something strikes you as innoproprate, then simply take @CAPS3 back and exchange @CAPS3 for something better.     One experience I can think of that is a good example of this is when I was @NUM1 years old. My mother took me into the library and I found a book, 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3.' I showed @CAPS3 to her just like any other time we had gone to the library. Only this time, she did not want me to check @CAPS3 out. She saw @CAPS3 as too harsh of a book for me to read at the time, she wanted me to wait untill I was older. @CAPS3 was about @CAPS1 abuse and she saw @CAPS3 as a very innoproprate book for my age, at the time. But she didn't blame @CAPS3 on the libraries, asking why they would carry such books where children could reach them.     Other mothers and fathers are the same way, as I found out. My best friend's parents had been the same way with her. Only instead of a book, @CAPS3 was a music cd that she had wanted to listen to. They thought that she should not listen to @CAPS3 because the lyrics in the songs were too 'sad' for her to hear. They agreed that if she were just a little older then she could of borrowed @CAPS3. They did not blame the library. If someone else wanted to listen to @CAPS3, or have their childen listen to @CAPS3, then @CAPS3 was their own personal choice.      I do not belive that libraries should have censorships. They can have different sections, such as adult, children, and young adult. But I believe that they should not have to take books, music, magazines, etc. off the shelves just because of certain people. @CAPS3 should be a person's personal choice. If they do not like the item that they picked up, they should take responsibility for their actions, and not blame others for their mistakes.

Many people are very stern about there thoughts when they believe in something very strongly.  In other peoples eyes you @MONTH1 find some who disagree and do agree with you from having similar life experiences.  All of which peoples opinions are created by life experiences and many tragedy' they have been apart of.  You will find sooner or later that some of the problems that many people deal with, that there is someone who has a lot worse than you do and that you should enjoy every moment you can.     Opinions are alternated often about many different things, being a homosexual is one of the many that people debate about most often.  In my opinion it doesn't really matter whether your homosexual or not you have to understand that everyone is different in there own way.  Exceptence is what' key to making eveyone get along at some point, but people struggle with homophobia.       Another big debate that many people have are with female and male opinions.  It seems as if they dont get along because they disagree, but neither could live without each other.  It's nearly impossible to find a male or female who agree' with you @PERCENT1, unless there pretending to be something there not.  From life experiences from parents arguing, friends fighting, and other relatives you see people forgive and forget so easily because the world is supposed to gifted and cherished everyday.     All in all I believe that most books are based off of reality and other peoples visions on the world and what they see.  I also find it interesting when people are very dramatic when trying to get there point across.  It helps others get a clear picture of who and what they go through.

Should materials in libraries be censored? No, i dont think that stuff in libraries should be censored or taken off the shelf. If something is offensive to someone then that person doesnt need to look at that material. People should have the right to get whatever they want from the library and if someone doesnl't like the materials they have then thats too bad.     What if kids get bad stuff off the shelf ? If a kid were to get something bad or innapropriate for themselevs the libraries wont let them check it out so it is fine, and the parents should be watching the kids get.     I go to the library all the time and I have never seen anything thing that is innapropriate and i don't know anyone who has ever told me they have found something offensive in a library, because I think the libraries know what people want and what people dont want there. and it's not right to take something off the shelfs if a few people dont like it because im sure other people like it. But if there is something very offensive that everbody thinks is bad than you can remove but you can't remove material every single time someone complains it is offensive because then there probally wouldn't be anything left in the library.     So I dont think anything should be removed from shelves just because some people find it offensive because im sure just as many people don't find it offensive and it would be wrong to take it from those people.

I've recently read a letter from Katherine Paterson about censorship in libraries. This is my opinion expressed in words about how I feel about the whole topic.     I've been reading ever since I hit first grade. To be honest, I couldn't tell you the names of @PERCENT1 of them because... well I just can't remember them. I'd like to think that it's because I have a horrible memory, but the truth is, they were just unappealing and unmemorable books. In all aspects, these books could be considered a waste of my life. Back then, I guess I only read them because I had nothing better to do, which is horrible because you should read books because you want to. I stopped reading books at around seventh grade because every book I picked up seemed to be extremely boring and it would take the first one hundred pages to actually have something decent happen.          Luckily, there is light at the end of this tunnel. Every now and then you come across a book that changes your life. Not literally, but it feels that way at the time (which is what you should feel). These are the books I remember. These 'life-changing' books all have things in them that would interest anyone who picks them up. Unfortunately, these things would be viewed as innappropriate to a select audience. For example, one book @MONTH1 talk about murder and be viewed as highly offensive by a person whose mother had been murdered, whereas the same book could be viewed as a piece of art by someone who has escaped the terribleness of death. Apparently it has gotten to the point where people would have the books censored or have them removed the libraries completely. I can stand idle no longer.     Books all go through a long, drawn-out process before they are shelf-ready. They need to be written, read, and selected to be published. For some books, this can take years. To completely alienate these books is extremely unfair to the time that was put into them. If you don't like the books, don't read them. It's as simple as that. If that's not enough reason for you, think of it this way: a book about a child getting raped and fighting to overcome it could serve as inspiration for rape victims. Or, a book about someone's parents dying could help a child in the same situation overcome the grief.     All books serve a purpose and should remain staunch on the shelves of local book stores, regardless of the methods used in them. Even if they don't appeal to you, it could be a completely different experience for someone else halfway across the world. Let these books serve their purpose.

Should taking books, music, and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned? Aa stated in our constitutuion, people have the freedom to information. People have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country. Also @CAPS1 have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not too. So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off shelves is completely out of the question,     In the @ORGANIZATION1, it @ORGANIZATION1 that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including freedom to information. Due to this reason places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on there shelves. Even if some of the conduct is inapropriate, it is still serves a way to educate. Which for children, education is largely what their childhood is for. Parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home. If books were to be taken of the shelves, we @CAPS1 would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world. All books or magazines @MONTH1 benificial to some and offensive to others. However for those who would find this beneficial do we want to simply go against our @ORGANIZATION1 and deprive them of that information?     Another topic in the @ORGANIZATION1 is the freedom of choice. Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelve, children have the choice to pick them up. Parents should simply tell there kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else. Having books that @MONTH1 seem innapropriate to some, aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelve. However some, @MONTH1 come aross a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out. This action plays no effect on child who is not supossed to be viewing material like that. Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information, all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it.     As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines. For example I was restricted from watching rated @CAPS2 movies or things with innapropriate sexual actions. Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content. For most of my childhood I did this and it was very simple. However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children. For the reason that it's their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all. Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privelage to view them.     In conclusion, removing materials,s uch as books, music, and movies is completely absurd. As I said before doing something like this, would be going against our constitutuion. The answer to solving this problem to me is black and white, children should just not pick up those types of materials end  of case

Brian @PERSON1 @NUM1 @DATE1 @CAPS1 @NUM2                                    Censorship in Libraries          Should there be censorship in Libraries? If this is a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 library no, but if it is a @ORGANIZATION1 library, yes. I am going to tell you what I think about the books, movies and magazines.          First I'm going to tell you about the books. I think the books in a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 should not be censored because parts of history get kind of gross and nasty. Then also sex ed books need to be in the library so people can read about it and not just go with what other people say. I don't think they should matter if its a nasty love book or a @CAPS2 @PERSON2 book, all that matter is that they are reading. War books should not be censored because they need to let the reader know how war really is and its not a great place to be. Now in a @ORGANIZATION1 library yes because no parent would want their eight year old daughter reading about how to make drugs. I think they could put stuff in there about drug or alcohol perhaps but not go in depth, but keep it at a bare minimum.           Next  I'll talk about the movies they should have avalible in the library. I don't think anything over @NUM3 at a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 level. Exept like sex ed tapes and history movies, no free days in class, its got to be @NUM3. In @ORGANIZATION1 I it should be @CAPS3-@CAPS4 movies. In those grade they really dont watch educational films it's all for fun films, so theres no reson for there to be anything worse than @CAPS3-@CAPS4.          Last I'm going to tell you about magazines. In @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I don't think the magazines are a big issue. Just as long as theres not @CAPS7 and stuff like that. At the @ORGANIZATION1 leave again I think they should be, kids that age shouldn't be reading @ORGANIZATION2. They just need to have learning and for fun magazines.          Should there be censorship in libraries? No at the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 level and yes at the @ORGANIZATION1 level. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 leave the book shouldn't @ORGANIZATION1 they should, should in both @ORGANIZATION1 movies, and magazines shouldn't in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 and should in @ORGANIZATION1.

I think that your parents should have to sign a peice of paper saying that it is ok or its not ok for the person to go to that side of the library. It is up to the parents and the way there kids will handle it.     On one side of the library it would be more geared to a more mature audience no pornagraphic material of course but stuff that wouldnt be considered @NUM1. Kids fifteen and and older would understand. They might also have to have an adult with them.      On the other side of the library it would be more of a childrens area with child storys. It would be targeted for more kids that are fourteen years and younger would like.      There would have to be some one in the dividing line being shown the pass that says its ok or not. It would be a little difficult but it would satisfy both parties.     It is up to the parent to decide if it is ok for there children to read a certain content of language and description. The child must be at least @NUM2 in order to get a pass from the parent though.     I deffinately agree with Katherine Paterson eventually your kids will find out what all those things are. I would rather have my kids learn from a book and ask me then find it out on the streets where they could end up getting hurt or in trouble with the law. Or even going to a party and end up doing something that might kill them.

'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 many people believe that certain books should be banned from schools, just the opposite is true as students can learn valuable life lessons from these books, get a deeper understanding of the past, and comprehend the true meaning of an author's unique style.     Over the years many well-written books have been on a 'censored list', meaning that they are at a risk of being removed from the library.  'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2', and '@CAPS3 to @ORGANIZATION3' are all examples of books that have been marked down as being offensive.  These books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader.  While one reader @MONTH1 love the story and wear out the pages, another @MONTH1 get halfway through and never finish it.  However, the belief that there is freedom of choice in reading is correct.     'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON1 is a classic example of a censored book.  Throughout the book there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some.  However, at the period of time the book was written, these words were not considered to be wrong.  Books like this should be saved for older generations to read; however, we also have to realize that if a parent allows their children to read that book at a young age, there is nothing that can be done about it.  None-the-less, removing the book from the library is not the correct response.     Ever heard the saying 'learn from past mistakes'?  Books are a fantastic way to learn about the past in a fun and enjoyable way.  They are a tool of knowledge.  Removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge.  Every story has a unique style, which @MONTH1 appeal to some and not to others.  Many books give readers a deeper understanding of what the time period was like when the book was written.     '@ORGANIZATION2' has been a known censored book from the beginning due to its somewhat dark and gloomy aspects at certain points throughout the story.  How many kids do we see at school carrying around one of the '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2' books?  They often state that it is their favorite book of all time.  If the book were to be removed from the library, it would cause many students to never have the opportunity to read a fantastically written book, which has a unique style about it.     Throughout our twelve years of school, students are taught to think for themselves and make their own decisions.  How are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp?  If we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book, we are teaching poor life lessons.

Some people believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. However, I do not believe they should be removed. People are mature enough to be able to handle offensive material. Most people check out books or movies that they have heard about, so for the most part they know what they are reading @MONTH1 be offensive. Instead of removing the ofensive material, there should just be a warning to let readers know that what they are checking out is considered offensive.           These days, people are mature enough to read offensive material. We see many types of offensive material every day. Examples of this inlcude when we watch the news, we @MONTH1 see numerous offensive pictures or videos. There are also many news stories that many people consider offensive. When a person checks out an offensive book, they are doing so because they want to. Libraries should not revoke a reader's right to read what he/she wants.           Before a person checks out a book or movie, they should look into it to make sure they are okay with what they are getting. This can prevent many problems. For example, say a young reader sees a book that they think looks interesting. If they don't read into it a little bit and just take it home, they @MONTH1 later find that it contains offensive material. However, if they read a little bit about it before they check it out, they will find out it contains offensive material, and can then make the decision on whether or not they still want to read it.           There are many ways libraries can prevent children or other people not mature enough to view the offensive material from seeing it. They can put a warning label on the book or movie to inform people that that particular item is considered offensive. Libraries could even put an age limit on checking out offensive material. Either of these ideas could be an efffective way to ensure that only mature people are checking out anything that is considered to be ofensive.     Libraries should not have to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that contain offensive material from the shelves. If a person wants to check out a book that is offensive, they should be allowed to check it out and read it. Also, people should be intelligent enough to look into whatever item they are checking out before hand so they can be aware of the offensive material. However, to make things even easier, libraries could just put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it.

I think that books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should be aloud to stay on the shelves of stores and libraries. We have to ask our selves these questions. Why should we take them out of libraries? What would people have to read when those books tell us about what went on in the early days, such as slavery, automobiles, and etc.? Who wants to sit and read about other stuff that is just down right boring?     Why should we take down the books in the library? We shouldn't take the books down off the shelves. We @MONTH1 have the right to take down the books but why should we. It is taking away the knowledge for our children. We would be taking away a lot of stuff the our children should know about, such as the slavery, and famous people.     What would we have to read about if we took most of the books out of the library? We would have nothing to read about other then the stuff that doesn't matter to us anymore. You have to think about if we took all of the books that were inappropraite off the shelves of the library there wouldn't be anymore books. Every book out there has something bad in it, so we would have to take away all the books other than the little kids books.      Who would want to go to the library and want to sit there knowing that they are going to be reading something that is not interesting and just boring? I can tell u who wants to do that. Nobody,'' it's just dumb to do it and has no point, unless you are old, then you @MONTH1 like to, but not everybody is old. Reading is fun to some kids and they want to read about different stuff, but if we take the books they can't.      We don't need to take any books out of the libraries? There would be no reason to go to the library or even read books, cause there isn't any good ones. We are just taking away something that is really big to us @CAPS1, and without those books there is no history for us to study. Our kids need to see those books even if we don't want them to. That is the early days and they need to know about all of it and how it was back then when they didn't have everything we do now. You can't take away something that is fun to do so why take them

I believe if i worked at a library , if I found multiple idems that  has profanity, rasicm, slang.I agree with taking Magazines, @CAPS1, Music books, @CAPS2 books ,etc., I wouldnt want my own children going to the library and finding books with racism, etc.I would like to inspire more people to check out library books but you could'nt if there were inappropriate books .     If i worked at a library and I had to scan all the books to make sure the books were okay for young adults, young children to check out. How would it make you feel if I didnt do a book scan to check the books and one of your children brought home a inappropriate book how would you respond to it?    I would do a observation on all the books that we had in our library. I also think that all libraries should have more inspireing books and cartooon , and baby books for little children. I think if majority of us all went to the library and we found a bad book I think we should have the right to remove it from the shelf, not only I would'nt want my children to see i woul'nt want someone elses children to see. This is how i feel if my child picked up a bad vulnerable book.I would'nt let he/or she go back to the library until they organized there library.     Lastly I think librarys should have a big room full of little kids books. Also i think they should have different age groups like one room for baby books another room for @NUM1 to @NUM2 year olds and on up. I hope this inspires you .Always read the back of a book before checking it out of the library because you never know what the books going to be about

I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies etc. should not be removed if they are found offensive. The library has different sections for different groups like the yound @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 section, easy children or picture and @CAPS1.      Young @CAPS1 or the @CAPS2 section is for mainly the teens. They have books that a teen who normally read. The @CAPS2 section has music which teens listen to. For @CAPS4 they have the twlight soundtrack. This section does not have any explicit language.The teens who go into the library actually enjoy the select of books offered to them.It has everything most teens like to read about. There is nothing offensive in this section and it should not be removed.     There is also a childrens section called the easy or picture book section. This section are for the younger children. Children that are not in school or in the early stages of school. The books, music an movies in this section are cartoons an animals. Things that children would like to read, listen or watch about. For @CAPS4 this section has movies like strawberry shortcake, athur, even lilo and stitch. eveything in this section is made for children there is not one thing in this section where the child or parent who think is offensive.     The library has a section for adults. The @CAPS1 section is there to catch adults eye. It a separate fom the @CAPS2 and Children sections. It is located at the other end of the library. If there is an @CAPS1 who thinks that something is offensive they have the right to talk to someone who works at the library. Most adults do not have a problem with the items in thier section. The library keeps the adults section with things that adults would want to look for. It would not have something little children would want.      The entire library is split up into different sections. It is easy for the children to look at books for them and for adults to do the same. There are only a few that I named but every age group has a specific spot at the library. If there is something found offensive to the people I dont think it should be removed because it might just be in the wrong section. The library takes great precaution to the censorship of their books, movies music etc

There should be a certain age bookshelf that only certain aged people are aloud to look at. It's like the adult section at the library. Theres no reason why they should be removed off of the shelves. I would understand if the little kids could come see the books and movies and be offended by it or scared but thats why you would make a certain section just for older more mature people.     It would just depend on what offends people and what would make them offended. Some things could or would be bad to have little kids see them, but just make sure they couldnt get in the reach of young kids or not matured people. The only way i would say remove them if it was really offensive such as racism and things like that.     Censorship in libraries in my opinion is a good thing. Just because the fact of some people might not like the things that would be in a library or things that they have in the library. So I would have to say yes on cersorship in the library.

In my opinion everyone should have a right to go to the library and get whatever book, magazine, movie, and music they what. People go to the library for a lot of reason computers, books, etc. Also having a public library comes handy for people that don't have a computer at home. It's a public library you should be able to go there an find about anything you need book or movie wise.     Everyone has differnt likes an interests about their books or movies, and i'm sure people go to the library an expect them to have what they are looking for. Some people do go to the library an not find what there looking for. Then people get mad an upset cause they figured the library would have it an they don't. But yes I think that there should be any kind of magazine, movie, or book at the library that you need. I mean it's a library they should have it all.     Also people have the right to go get whatever book, or movie they want. It's called freedom everyone is diffrent and everyone likes diffrent things. There has been a few times I have went to our library to find books or movies an they didn't have them. You would think that a library would have a book or movie over trying to potty train a toddler, but they didn't.     I think that they should have any an every kind of book, magazine, an movie you want at the library. Yeah some people @MONTH1 take offense to it but who cares obviously they don't want it so leave it an go get what you want. Just cause you don't like it don't mean other people don't. So no I don't think just cause some people don't like them they should be removed from the shelves.     So no i absolutely do not think that any books, movies, magazines should be removed from the shevles. You are who  you are an you like what you like it shoudn't matter what other people think about it as long as it's what you like. So in my opinion the library should be a good use to everyone, and leave the books, magazines, etc. on the shevles for the people who do like to read or watch them

Coming from a teenager, @CAPS1 offensive books, magazines and movies should be removed from a local library. A library is a place to go relax and read. Most books and movies are filled with sex,gang violence, and drugs. In my generation sex, durgs and, gang violence seem to be high at risk everywhere. Books are suppose to be about learning. Offensive books and movies set bad habit on younger children.These are the reasons offensive books movies and also magazine should be removed from our local libraries.         Sex, gang violence, and drugs seem to appear everywhere in my generation. Whenever you open your magazine you find different topics, but they all deal with either sex, drugs, or violence. Children should never be exposed to that type of  offensive behavor. You should be able to open a magazine and   learn somthing brand new.    Books are good for reseach paper and other school project, but sometimes you cant find what you are looking for because of other topics. Reason you cant find what your looking for is because every book or magazine you look threw is covred with  the topic you dont want. As a teenager each book I look at its always about sex or gang violence.     If younger children, countiued to read about bad topics, it will create a bad habit on that child. They say you are involved  with what you read. Bad habit could lead to many things, such as killing, smoking , and pregnacy's. Thats why all parents should have guidence over there children.     Being who I am , there should never be any offensive books, movies, and magazine in a local library. Offensive books and movies can cause many problems. It drive children where they sont need to be, and you wont be able to learn if you have to many bad habit. there should only be book and movies where you a re able to learn something in your local library.

Should materials that are offensive be taken off shelves?Should movies you loved and use to watch when you were a kid be gone in a instant?     Magazines are offensive, they always have been, they get the truth out of celebrities and people and they twist their words into something totally different from what they said. There are tons of movies in this world that will show harm to people, replay a bad part of somebodys life, say things about people.Music is just words and sound, they make songs about people that have done stuff in the past , that people would find offensive. I have seen a music video about @PERSON1 and making fun of her being in jail, but do i think that should be taken off the computer, no its entertaining.This world needs something to keep us intertained. Imagine what it would be like if we had no news reporters, no paparazzi. We wouldnt know anything going on around the world, and seeing the things about celebrities that they would find offensive, i can understand where they are coming from, getting talked about all the time, especialy about mistakes you have made in your lives, but thats how the world functions, thats always going to be apart of everyones lives,talk.     So as i have been saying, getting rid of movies,music,magazines,books that are offensive would not be a good choice in my opinion, cause what would entertain us if they were gone?

Everyone has a preference in works of literature, such as books, magazines, movies or music. Different types of these works of literature are significant to each person. If everyone had the right to completely remove one piece of work that displeases them, then no works would remain. Therefore, I believe no materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from public libraries or other public places. Everyone has unique ideas, necesities and preferences.     A few years ago, I had a classmate who had different ideas from a myriad of people on religious persecution. He hated the idea of mixing people of different religions into one place. He wrote a paper containing all of his ideas on how the world should function in terms of religion. He tried to publish it, but did not succeed because his work was considered offensive. Even though I disagree with his ideas, I do not think his work should have been rejected. There could have been people in the world who did agree with his thoughts and would have been interested to read them. There could even have been ideas in his paper that could've helped countries solve various problems. I believe it is unfair that his paper was rejected.     People have different necesities based on what they have to accomplish. For example, I was reading a book last @DATE1 about a girl who was doing a project on racism. She went to the library to search for a book about apartheid in @LOCATION1 but couldn't find anything. She asked a librarian if there were any, but the librarian told her that books such as those were considered offensive in that local library and she would have to search elsewhere. I believe that it is unjust because the girl @MONTH1 not have had anywhere else to go to get the information about her project. She should've had the right to access the information that she needed for the project to prevent her from failing.     Another reason that no books should be removed is simply because everyone has unique preferences. In the world, there are books that certain people would enjoy more than others. Literature should be abled to be used for the purpose of entertainment and convenience. If I were to go to a library now, I would find many selections that correspond to my ideal novel or magazine. Every person should have that right. If people start removing materials that are offensive to them, then nothing on the shelves would remain and not one person would have the right to have access to the materials they desire.     In this world, diversity exists everywhere. People have and always will want, need and desire different things. Works of literature are just one of them. If people begin to eliminate offensive materials based on everyone's frustration or displeasures, then no books will remain on the public shelves. Therefore, materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should never be removed from public places. These things are necessities to the world.

Everyone likes to watch movies, jam to some music, and get lost in an interesting book. Therefore everyone should be able to read, watch, or listen to what they want and the same things as other people are reading, listening to, and watching. Some things are needed to look up or look at if one is doing a project. Other people just @MONTH1 be entertained by certain peices of liturature, or music. In that case, why censor certain things that people are interested in, or even things to research, in libraries?     Many people enjoy violent writing or gorey movies. Reading these things also amusses them. So why take away what they like? If a library takes certain books off of their shelves, then they could be taking away a type of literature that people are interested in. If one removes a book that twenty people take pleasure in reading, then thats twenty people that are not going to want to read anything else. People are different in many ways. That includes the variety of things humans are interested in. For example, things they are interested to read. Humans having a major differences in characteristics, meaning they don't enjoy all the same things. The articles, magazines, or movies @MONTH1 be not suited for schools or libraries, but if it's a topic people like, or if it's someone needs for a project, then there is no reason to get rid of it.     Some books offten offend certain groups or races of people, but the book gets it uniqueness from what it says. Some books are writen in times of racisim. This shuold'nt make a book worth critisizing because that was the way things were said in that time. It allows the book to give off a feeling of living in the time is based in. On the other hand, some magazines are writen about horrible events and wars, but people find entertainment in reading about these events going on in the world. They want to know what is really happening across seas or even around home. Someone isn't able to know what's happening is no one lets him or her read the magazine.     Authors and writers write these things for the entertainment of people who want to read them. Due to the wide veriety of interest people have, there are many different types of writings. People should'nt have their favorite book taken off shelves just to see that the guy right next to him found the book he loves. That just would'nt be fare. Libraries should put on the shelf what people write, so that others @MONTH1 enjoy them.

In @LOCATION1, everyone wants censorship. Mainly because they dont want be the outcast. Thats understandable in the case that we have numerous amount of different races in @LOCATION1. In some ways, censorship is necessary and in other ways, some people just want attention. If all different races want censorship, then why would we censor to the liking of just one group of people?     Essentially, the censorship problem won't go away because it is a chain reaction. For example, if a group of people asked a library to get rid of books because of the references they make, that might be insulting to another group of people. then that group of people wouoldn't like a reference to another book, which another group of people dislike, and it goes on and on. So for the censorship towards different groups of people, there will have to be some tolerance.      On the other hand, young children are in need of censorship. They grow and mature everyday, developing physically and mentally. So if we were to put an inapropriate book in front of them, they would read it and accept is as standard. And when they read bad things like that, they develop the wrong goals and values for their future lives.      We are all different, and interpret things in different ways. So when you watch a movie to listen to music and think it wrong, someone right around the corner @MONTH1 think that its just normal. If you question someones movie or song, in the scheme of things, your questioning their judgement, and thats unfair to them

Hello, my name is @CAPS1, I feel that there should be any genre of media in libraries.  If they call it a 'media center,' then why censor any media.  People know to read the back of a book to see if they want it, so if they see something they don't like they are able to put it back on the shelf.  People say The @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 inspired @CAPS4 @PERSON2 to kill @PERSON1, that is completly speculated it's all a matter of 'he said she said.'  I feel there should be sections for different sections for different age groups, but to censor literature is just un-@CAPS5.     There should be a parent supervising children @NUM1 and younger, because where it really comes to are the children and them not being exposed to something there not ready for.  There are some magazines and movies I feel shouldn't be in librarys, and those are as follows: pornography, non-educational movies, @CAPS6 @CAPS7, and social networks.     I'm not saying to let kids listen to murderous music and jump off of the terrace but, shouldn't some leeway on books.  This is an approved message thank you for your time, goodbye.

Censorship in Libraries               Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 are many books, magazines, and movies out @CAPS1 that contain content not necessarily appropriate for young children. Part of a parent's job is to ensure their children are safe and looking at materials appropriate for their age level. However, this does not mean taking materials off of library shelves for everyone. Censorship in libraries rids people of their freedom to choose. Also, content that is inappropriate for children @MONTH1 be fine for adults to read. It is the responsibility of the parent to censor what their child takes off the shelf.      All people of @LOCATION2 have certain rights allowing them to express themselves and to be free. People have the freedom to choose, whether it is books, magazines, movies, or music. Everyone is different and this causes the interests of each person to be different, also. Libraries offer a variety of materials and this allows people to choose what they want based on their interests. Censoring the content on the shelves of libraries @MONTH1 be a good idea for children, however adults have the right to choose what they want to take from the shelf. Would you like to have a portion of your freedom taken away? Censorship would greatly lower the freedom of everyone and their individuality.     Furthermore, censoring what is on the shelves of libraries limits the range of materials that are available to patrons. @CAPS1 is content out @CAPS1 that children should not see; however adults have the right to choose what they want to read and come in contact with. Although certain materials are not meant for children to see, adults @MONTH1 find it enjoyable and interesting. Libraries offer a large range of materials and this allows people to express themselves and find entertainment. @CAPS1 are many different types of books and music out @CAPS1 and censoring these would greatly limit the variety.      In addition, parents have the responsibility to watch over their children. They choose what @CAPS1 child wears, where they live, and where they attend school. It is no different when it comes to books, movies, and music. Each parent has a different style of parenting and they choose what works best for their child. If one parent finds something to be offensive or inappropriate, they shelter their children from it. However, another parent @MONTH1 not have a problem with it. The content children choose from library shelves should be at the discretion of the parent. Afterall, you cannot shelter children from everything.      Censorship in libraries results in more problems than solutions. It rids patrons of their right to choose and their freedom. Censoring materials also greatly limits the variety of content available for people to choose from. It is not the responsibility of the law to choose what children can and cannot read, but rather the parent's job to watch over what they take off the shelf. As citizens of the @LOCATION1, we have rights and freedom allowing us to act as indivuals. Censoring the materials on library shelves results in very little materials left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books life on the shelf for any of us.

The material we read in books are sometimes offensive. Books that are offensive should be supervised as to who gets to view them. I believe that every parent has the right to oversee what there child reads. I also believe that Censorship is a good thing sometimes     The material we find in books is not as much of a proplem to our youth as any other thing. The reasoning for me saying this is that youth to day are not really woried about picking up a book and reading is as much as them picking up a magazine, cellular phone, iPod or using a computer. I believe magazines are worse than any book. Books are reed mostly for knowledge wereas magazines are mostly reed for people to catch up on the latest trends. Magazines can lead to people listing to the next hotest band, singer or rapper, whatever.          Music that you hear on the radio is filled with suggestive lyrics. Then people get pulled in. Music doesn't have rating were movies do. Movies are a little easier to control because of there ratings but children are alway going to get there hands on it no matter what.      This is were the internet comes into play. Most people have acsess to a computer. Children could be on the internet for hours looking up things that aren't ment for them to see. Internet is also use to educate.      The internet also opens up the doors to video games. Children can play with there friends all around the world now without leaving there bedroom. They also play with complete stranger. Some of the other player could be a bad influence to them because they were influenced by music, magazines, music, ect.., that send a bad message.           No one is ever going to be able to control what our youth see. The only way is to close our libraries and shut down the internet. Even if we do this there could always still be away.

Should books, movies, magazines etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. No, because all you have to do is ignore it or not pay any attention to it and it shouldn't bother you that much. Most people might look at something and think it is interesting like something that happened on the news lately and was published on newspapers or put on the internet. For example, the @LOCATION1 story, that has been on the news for the past week, people think that it is awesome that he is was finally found and killed. If people found that offensive that might be because they don't know what he did or wasn't around when it happened.     If they took down stuff that was offensive then we would have nothing interesting to read. If someone found a movie that was racist the don't get it, just put it back and find something else like a romance or a comedy. Everybody could use a laugh every once and a while. For music if your friend recommends something to you, check it out on the internet first to see if it is any good, if not then tell them no and that you find it offensive. If they were a true friend then they would understand and perhaps make it up to you with something else.      Magazines, from what I know don't really have anything offensive in them. The only thing the have a some pictures, gossip, facts, and some stories that might peak your interest. Books might have something things that you find offensive but, if you like the book so much you might as well finish it. If you found a book that you really like then read through it a bit or check it out on the internet to see what is about. Out of all the books I have read, I have found none of them offensive they were all good books, books that i would probably read again if I wanted to, but I won't, because I'm lazy.      Newspapers are interesting to read and might have little to none offensive remarks in them. Some might pertain to blacks or mexicans, something like that. Well I haven't read any like that yet but, I have heard somethings about it. In the newspapers there might be little comics or gags that would probably be more offensive than anything in the newspapers. I think that if you find something offensive then just ignore it and move on to something else instead  of throwing a fit about it because that wouldn't do well at all.

The content in todays materials are not always subtible for young children. Information now distributed in the media and other networks can be harmful for some young children to read or be surrounded by, including video games. By growing up in a violent enviornment, children observe and have the greater chance at becoming violent. The continuence of censorship in todays materials are a necessity to the well being of the children in todays society.     In video games there are ratings that help explain wat is subtible for each age throughout childhood and adolesence. Movies are also the same, making it harder for younger children to see certain movies. Books and magazines are not as well protected although they should be. Age and maturity plays a huge role in whether or not a child should be aloud to read and be introduced to specific material. Violence is a major trend in video games in todays world, and some of the influence it brings on children is unecessary and eventually detrimental to their well being.     The reason ratings should be changed is because children obsorb their enviornment and become what they see, so if they are introduced to violent behavior they have a greater chance in becoming violent children. In libraries there are sections for every age group, specific genre of books, fiction, and non fiction. But some of the explicit material in books and magazines should also be censored before they are distributed on shelves and allowed available for young teenagers and children. As a part of the community libraries should take apart in the well being of the children and not expose them to information earlier than necessary.     Throughout my own experience, I have seen children grow up too fast when exposed to certain knowledge. Especially in todays music, radios do a good job in editing content in songs, by puting parental advisory on certain cd's, but this still does not stop them from buying the material. In games including, @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, @NUM1, etc. teens are now becoming accostumed to this type of behavior, that is not safe nor condusive for children.     By censoring certain material it disallows the continuence of bad behavior amongst our youth today

Censorship in liraries, in my opinion is over-rated. Everywhere you hear of book, music, magazines, and movies being offensive or degrading, but does that mean that they should be taken off the shelves of our public libraries, or out of book stores? I say no because, future generations need to know of the material, it @MONTH1 not always be offensive, and the public libraries have no right to tell us what we can, and cannot read.     Some say that our future generations will be greatly shorted of knowledge, or become naive because of this lack of knowledge. I say this is because of the censorship in libraries. Katherine paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other chilren have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. An then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So if they're taking books off the shelve because they find them offensive, then there will be so many books gone, that the kids will not have a broder view as so many people are lucky to have today.     Everyone has a different oppinion about everything, including what's offensive and what's not. If one person see's a book as being offensive, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone else will also. I've heard of teachers not letting the students see pictures of The @CAPS1, because the think it's offensive. Not everyone agrees with that. The @CAPS1 is a big part in history and it being catorgorized as offensive is wrong, it's not the only thing in history that is bad. If they start taking out big parts of history, it will be long lost and forgotten.     Lastly i believe that the libraries should not be able to tell us what we can and cannot read. We have the right to choose what we want to read, if we think that it's bad and shouldn't be reading it, then we won't read it. But that doesn't mean they should take out the book because one person finds it offesive. Someone else might want to read it. I think that people are mature enough to pick what they read, and as for children their parents are the one's that could pick for them.     With so many different oppinions it's hard to decide what to do about censorship, I believe that if it's offensive maybe they should have a special section for explicit media and reading. Maybe then people wouldn't be offended by it. Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean another wouldn't either.

Do you believe that certian materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, no i do not. it is one thing to censor a book or movie, but to completley remove it is another. I feel like authors, artists, musicians, and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want. Regardless of who is reading it.     I feel like censorship is wrong. Authors should be able to feel free to express there thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like. some times storys cannot be explained or told the way it needs to be without certain words. Wether those words be good or bad i feel like with out them the book that is being read is not all of what it could of been. in my oppionion censorship takes away from certain values or qualitys the book could of had with the original context still in it. and to me that is not fair. its not fair to the author. and is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book.     I know from my personal expierences with reading books that 'yes' i have read books that have had bad language in them. but just because a book has one or two bad words in it does not mean that it should be completley taken off the shelf. For example the book '@CAPS1' @CAPS2: @PERSON1 was an amazing book. I probably enjoyed that book more than i have any other book that i have ever read in my entire life. But that book would not be nearly as good as it was with it being scensored or taken off the shelf for that matter.     All i am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it. because that is getting away from what the over all message is about. Your almost taking the words out of context when you do this. Do i believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? No i do not. Neither should you

I think that libraries should not remove material such as book, music, movies, magazines. I think that libraries should keep them because thier are alot of people tht has thier own stlye at reading. Sometimes i will go to the librarie and get a book, then i will go look at magazines, movies, music. Thier are alot of movies out right now, and now u can go cheak them out. Music is the same way. I feel like if thier stuff in the librarie that kids like they should go for it. Im sure that they have edgucational books, movies and magazines.                                                                                  If  people take out stuff that kids and teens like. Some of them might not return back.Thier are alot of students that listen to music and watch movies too. I love cheaking out movies from the libraries its easy and they always have the movies that u are lookin for. The movies are easy to find. and its quick. If the music has some offfensive stuff in it that they should take it off the shelves because it will have peopel thinkin why would they put a movie, music, magazines and book up on the shelves if they know it is offensive to the public.                                                          Inconclusion i hope the people at the libraries take the offensive stuff off the shelves.It would bring move people in and they would have more respect for thoes people. The public would`t have to worrie about picking up a book that has alot of stuff that thier kids do not need to see, read, or listen. That goes for movies, music, magazines, books and more. I really hope the people make the right choice

Do you think that books, movies, music, etc., should be moved if they are found offensive? I can't choose @CAPS3 they are both understandable. Therefore, I well dicuss how i feel about it in this essay and what I have experience on this topic.     Well lets get started! I could go both ways with this. But first I well just discuss the way I disagree with removing offensive things. Material that is instersting to many people mght not be instersting to me. I mean everyone should be able to listen and read things that the loved and enjoy. And I could really careless what other people loved to read and listen to. Someday, we all might come to enjoy things that we wouldn't every think we would. It's just that simply. I mean I love romance and scary books, and someone else might dislike them both. Noone can tell anyone what they should like or dislike.          I agree in away too! When people make a big deal out of somethings it kind of gets on your nerves, like when your mom is telling you make sure room is clean all the time! I agree with this @CAPS3 something maybe to offensive to someone and doesn't want their children. One time I was in a library looking at this book that really seemed good to read. But then some lady told me that I shouldn't read it @CAPS3 it to much for me. But it was just right for me. @CAPS2 went up to the main desk and started complaining. I was like, 'Are you serious?' I didn't want to be rude so I told her calmly, '@CAPS1 are you so worried about what I am reading?' @CAPS2 replied, ' @CAPS3, the book is to reviling.' I showed her what the book was called, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6'. We ended the agruement. I still checked out the book, @CAPS3 I knew I would love it, and I do! They should just put things aside, that they think well be offensive and let people ask for the things. So people won't make a big deal out of it. Just keep the peace and give everyone what they want.          Well I'm done now. Hope you understand both sides of the agruement. Just remember that if you agree or disagree.Or you like me, who can't choice or understands both sides. It's your decision and noone can make you change what you love and enjoy to read or listen to. But I can't pick aside @CAPS3 either way their both a understandable.

'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly yhe same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' states Katherine Paterson. Books and movies all over the world are being censored and removed from libraries, day after day, due to their explicit content. I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelf, and that they are there for a genuine purpose. Explicit objects should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, children's parents have a right to exclude the material from the child's life, and some material can be useful in life and someone @MONTH1 learn from @CAPS3.      Children everywhere are being influenced by books, magazines, movies, and even songs. Some people argue that these harmful materials are affecting how kids behave and act. I, however, believe that a child should have superb morals and values to know right from wrong. For example, if a child happens to see a pornography magazine lingering on a shelf of their local grocerey store, they should know that no matter how temping @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, that buying that pornography magazine would be wrong. From birth, parents are constantly teaching their children what is right and what is wrong. They attempt to teach their children the basics: that drugs, alcohol, and smoking will corrupt their health. @CAPS3 doesn't matter if a child sees someone doing drugs in a movie or hears a song about a teenager getting drunk. They should not be influenced by this because by using their logic, they should infer that what is being read or listened to isn't always the right thing to do.     Everyday, children's parents have the right to exclude harmful material from a child's life. After all, they are a superior figure in the child's life, and the child will always look up to them to lead the way. At most local theaters now, you have to be seventeen to see a rated '@CAPS1' movie. A lot of theaters allow a child to view a rated '@CAPS1' movie, no matter what age, as long as they have a parent or a gardian present. Movie theaters feel that by having a child's parent there would help immensly because the parent is choosing for their child to watch that particular movie, instead of the child viewing the movie without their permission. If a parent doesn't want their child to view a raunchy movie, they can simple say, 'NO!' @CAPS3's as simple as that. If a parent feels that a movie is decent for a child to watch, then go ahead and let them watch that material. Parental agreement should always be a main factor in determined whether or not a child could view a particular movie or read a certain provacative book.      If all offensive books and movies were removed from the shelf, we would be living in a structured world where no one would learn any more than what they already knew. Life @MONTH1 possibly become rather boring. Although, some people @MONTH1 find books and songs to be offensive, others @MONTH1 contribute from these materials. A child @MONTH1 pick up a book, start reading, and discover some disturbing thoughts that they never would have encountered beyond picking up that book. They would never of learned such things. Reading information like this, creates a move advanced society. Adults and children are becoming smarter each day. Any parent would agree that they would love any opprotunity to arise for their children to become smarter and more wiser than they already were. Songs, movies, books, and magazines could provide that for their child. Reading is an escape from a jungle of wild monkies for some children. They @MONTH1 use a book to get away from the struggles of everyday life and get lost within its lively pages. If more and more books are being censored and thrown out, that equates to less books a child could have an opprotunity to discover. I once read that even @CAPS4 classes all over the world are not allowing their students to read The @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 @CAPS7. The teachers find this book to be too inappropriate for their students. This is unfair for any student, because this novel is inspiring and life changing, so they are definitely missing out. Also, movies and songs are provided for one's pure entertainment, so @CAPS3 shouldn't always matter if its crude. A child or young adult @MONTH1 learn things that they never thought imaginable through provided public materials.     In conclusion, books, magaizines, movies, and music are one's individual way of expressing themself. They should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, parents have the right to exclude offensive material from a child's life, and material, not matter how crude @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, can be used as a learning tool. If more and more material is being removed from our local libraries, @CAPS3's almost like authors are being punished for being unique. Our children won't be exposed to as much, therefore, they won't learn and grow from @CAPS3. Do you really want our society to prohibit intelectual thinking just because they think certain material @MONTH1 be offensive? Think about @CAPS3

I think that all offensive materials should be removed from librarys so every one can read a book listen to music and watch movies with out being offended. They shuld have there own section for that kind of material.                                                     Movies that are bad should be taken off the shelf. They should have a section just for those movies. The sction should be locked up so children can't get those movies. I think that this would be fair for everyone.      Music that is bad should be taken off the shelf. They should have a section just for that kind of music. The section should be locked up so children can't get that kind of music. I think that this would be fair for everyone.      Magazines that are bad should be taken off the shelf. These magazines should have a section just for those magazines. They should be locked up. I Think that this would be fair for every one. Books that are bad should be taken off the shelf. They should have a secton just for these books. these books should be locked up so children cant get them. I think that this would be fair for everyone.     This is what I think should be done with this offensive materials. If this was done everyone would have a book to read  a magazine to look at music to listen to and a movie to watch

Should books and such be removed off of the shelves if they are found offensive? Personally I don't think they should be. If @CAPS3 is something in the book that is remotelly offensive towards children then it should be put under a section for adults only.  Most libraries I have been to have different areas for each age group. If @CAPS3 is a book that is racially unexceptable then it should be put in the adult section not anywhere for children.      When a book is being questioned if it is offensive or not they should review all the possibilities of how someone @MONTH1 comprehend the story to see their reaction with it. @CAPS3 are many genres of books, music, magazines, etc., so @CAPS3 is always a place that the book can go to. Most of the questioning about a book is the language in it. For example, in @CAPS1 we just finished reading the book '@CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS3 is a lot of question if the book should be read in schools or not because of the 'n-word'. It is a very harsh word, but it goes with the setting and the background of the story. When someone is not sure if a book is acceptable or not they should take in concideration what the story is about and whether or not the word is needed or not. In many cases the unexceptable thing @MONTH1 work along with the story.     If one book is being questioned about something wrong with it then shouldn't all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be questioned? If something is not allowed for one item then it shouldn't be allowed for something else. It is all about the audience who reads that certain book if it is appropriate or not to the person reading it. I have read many books that have certain words that don't bother me, but someone else who isn't use to it @MONTH1 not like. Some parents don't want their kids hearing foul language or inappropriate stuff from the type of music they listen to. It all comes down to who reads the book or magazine, and who listens to the music. Katherine Paterson makes a very good point about how if we start taking the books off of the shelves then eventually @CAPS3 wouldn't be any books left on the shelves anymore. Just becasue something has a bad word or phrase in it doesn't mean it needs to be taken away from peoples enjoyment!

There are alot of things that u can find in the libraies that you can find to be inapporite to some but not all people. if there was something that i was ofined by then i would ask them to pull it off the shelf. if u have somewhat of a project to do then go to the libarie to meet some friends and work on it there. If you need help to finding a book for your project ask the person at the desk where to find it. The libarie is here to help those that dont have a computer at home, they can go to the libarie and do there work there.               If they would have alot of there books on a disc or dvds,movies,tape players alot more people would want to read more. If that all libarie had all the same books  then they would have more people in and out getting the book they want to read. if there was little kids that want to read kid books then they should have a section for them. All the libarie should get ride of the inapporite books that some of the people right off the shelf so that they dont have people complaing about the material on the shelf.     Theres probale about @NUM1 to @NUM2 libarie in the @LOCATION1. I know for fact that there something inapporite on the shelf in all ther libaries. There are tons and tons of books in all of the libarie so theres a good chance there something out there that someone will find they dont like and ask for it to be taking off the shelf. if they would get alot of people saying they are offenied by it then they would have to take it off.     There is also alot of magasins out there that some should be seen to little kids. if they get on that talks about drugs and some other things they could be offensive by that. all magasins should have some what of a rating on them. you would have to be older than @NUM3 years of age to get a pg-@NUM3 mag. some of the magasins should be for little kid that go there all the time and adult. they should have them divid into sections for little kids and adults. They need to respect all the people in the libarie at that time. I think that theres some of that here in are home town but not @PERCENT1 postive there is. We all have the right to ask them to take it off the shelf and if they dint then they well get into trouble

Good? Bad? Offensive or not? These are just a few of the questions asked when referring to content in any given book, magazine, or even a song. Who are we to judge what's good, what's offensive, or even what is appropriate for any being?     From things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. the author(s) @MONTH1 express what they feel on a given topic. Though their opinion might not please others, there's nothing that can be done about it. In society people are going to talk, to write, to sing, to listen. Whether everyone agrees with that is a different story.      In society, no matter what the topic is, there will always be at least one person that has a problem with it. The world will never be perfect! The only thing that can be done to assuage the chaos is for people to self censor what they @MONTH1 ingest from reading or listening to these different books and lyrics. If one shows so much emnity towards a given topic, then they are able to do as they please, and choose not to listen/read.      At the bottom of numerous cd's, both explicit and non, there is a label, an advisory that warns a person. It will briefly tell you that there is some content they @MONTH1 not be appropriate, that @MONTH1 hurt feelings, and simply offend. It is then that one can choose to listen to the cd or not.      Every human is entitled to freedom of speech. This doesn't necessarily mean that everything said by a being is okay; but everyone is entitled to his own opinion. There are words spoken that will offend many! From @PERSON1 using racial slurs in speeches, to @LOCATION1 calling females derrogatory words, all the way back to a white male calling his colored friend a nigger.      People will always be offended. There are many different ways of looking at life, and many different opinions. Not everyone agrees with one another, because everyone is unique in his own way. From ethnicity to personalites, from talented athletes to intelligent students, and even from ancestors to religion. Everyone has something that defines them and makes them who they are. We are all special; and we all think differently. We find certain slurs and lyrics offensive, while others @MONTH1 not.      @NUM1 years ago when i was in @NUM2 grade, my @CAPS1 class was reading a story about the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. There were @CAPS4 young black children striving to get a respected education in a white school. Times were tough then, and there was still alot of racism in @LOCATION2. As my teacher read us this book everyday, we all sat and listened taciturnly. After the third day of reading this book, we all sat down like usual ready to finish the book. Five minutes into class as the teacher was reading the book, she read and enunciated every word in the book. In the middle of the sentence, it read 'nigger-lover', and the teacher didn't hesitate a bit as she said it. In less than @MONEY1, @NUM3 blacks children walked out of the room yelling curse words at the top of their lungs. This teacher didn't realize that she had offended these children by what she took as simply reading to her class.      The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' wasn't censored in any way. Though many children looked at it and felt some of the terms were harsh, no one ever thought there would ever be a riot caused at school. Because the teacher was white, and the children didn't want her to say that word, everyone attacked her vocally.      I've began to realize that everyone cannot be pleased. There will always be at least @NUM4 person that stands up and retaliates against something they dislike. In '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4', the book wasn't censored, but I still believe that it should stay on library shelves. That book allowed children to better understand how hard life was in the past. By keeping the harsh language, I feel as if people realize how much harder times were.      Books, music, movies, and magazines will always contain a statement that someone doesn't agree with, and by removing that I feel like one can not fully understand the message the author is trying to get across. For all of these reasons, I proudly say that I believe that these different books, movies, lyrics, and magazines should be kept on the shelves

Many people go to libraries; such as children, parents, and grandparents. I have come to realize that their purpose for going to this community loving place is to find peace and quiet. Some don't even go there for the books. They will engage in music, magazine, enjoy a cup of coffee, or simply get on the internet. Now some people argue that some of the books, music, and movies in libraries are inappropriate or offensive, but does that mean the libraries should have to get rid of them?     These materials people find offensive have no reason to be banned. First of all, the libraries will lose customers. There is a majority of people in the world who really like listening to rap or @CAPS1&@CAPS2. It's hard to find that kind of music without cuss words or sexual inuendo. Even I will listen to that type of stuff occasionally just so that I can have a cool beat stuck in my head for a while. Plus, when you are in a library and listening to music you will have head phones on, which isn't disruptive to other in or around the library.     Secondly, customers who don't like the context of these materials don't have to get them. If there is a book that has a sex scene or talks about drugs then don't read it. You have a choice to what book you would like to read and if that isn't your style then there are plenty of other aisles and children books you can look through. Those who are interested in those topics still deserve to be able to choose those books. I have been to my public library many atimes and all the times I have been there I have not once even seen a book, music, or a movie that looks displeasing to the eyes. So if you're a person who wants an offensive book, then it takes A @CAPS3 of looking, not just a quick little scan.     Finally, freedom. Isn't that was @CAPS4 is all about? The freedom of speech, and religion, and even what type of movies you want to watch. I know this might come as a shocker, but there are labels on the back of movies that tell whether it is @CAPS5, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1@NUM1, or @CAPS1. It also includes the not-so-nice content that will be present in the movie. So you have total freedom to purchase(check out) any of those rated movies. Like I explained clearly earlier, you aren't forced to watch any of the naughtier movies, so just pick what you want and be happy.      As you can see, there is absolutely no reason to remove offensive books, music, or movies. There are many different types and styles of these categories and it isn't disturbing anyone. Libraries will lose customers, people dont have to choose the less appropriate things, and us @CAPS7 have freedom to do what we please, especially with what we would like to read, listen to, or watch. So save youself some time and just keep the few so called 'offensive' materials.

There are tons of books in the library that people @MONTH1 find offensive to young readers today. I think that these materials should not be removed from the shelves. People have a right to read what they choose to read. There are many reasons why I think these materials shouldn't be removed from the library.     First of all, there are so many books that could be found as 'offensive.' @CAPS1 removing all of these offending books, you would basically be removing half the books in the library. Most young adult books have something to do with teens, drugs, violence, and other things that would come off as offensive. These books are usually the ones that teenagers read. Just because they're reading them doesn't mean their actions will be affected. These types of books are read for the purpose of entertainment and not meant to harm or offend anybody.     Secondly, I think that people have a right to choose what they want to read, listen to, and watch. Books, music, movies, and magazines are sold for this purpose. Everyone has a different opinion and taste to what they like or dislike.      Finally, I think that censoring what is put on the shelves would be a mistake. There are tons of great books or movies that could be found offensive and to take them off the shelf would make them less known. Children wouldn't know about them, and they could be missing out on some great stories.     Everyone has an opinion, and watching out for your children is understandable. Censoring what is available at the library would make finding books harder for other people. Libraries are meant to have different types of material because everyone has a different taste.

No Censorship     Do you enjoy reading interesting books, watching superb movies, or listening to appealing music that some people don't approve of? Most people would answer yes to the question because anything that a person reads, watches, or listens to @MONTH1 be found offensive or crude to someone else. Certain materials in libraries should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because different people find different materials offensive, people sometimes specifically come to libraries to search out materials they can't find elsewhere, and if a person finds a material offensive, they don't have to keep reading, watching, or listening to it.     The first reason reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because different people find different materials offensive. Each person is different, and people have all sorts of opinions on books, movies, magazines, music, etc. Also, several different ethnicities exist in the world and many nonfiction books educate people on different cultures around the world. The ethnicity of the people living in the culture @MONTH1 find what the authors of nonfiction books are writing about them offensive because the book is talking about something in their culture they wouldn't want the public hearing about. However, the public needs to be educated on the cultures of different people. Students do research in libraries for research projects and essays. Also, books pertaining to racism such as To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 and books about slaves @MONTH1 be offensive to the race that is being victimized in the book. In contrast, some people @MONTH1 love the book because of the a good theme, symbolism, word usage, etc. So, who would be the judge of whether a material is offensive of not? If the person who is doing this for a certain library finds many materials in the library offensive, the whole library could close down because many materials that could have been popular were taken out of the library.     Another reason why certain materials shouldn't be removed off shelves if they are found offensive is because sometimes people specifically come to libraries to search out materials they cannot find elsewhere. Libraries are the one place that people go if they are looking for that certain book or maybe even a movie they can't find at a video store. In my experience, there have been an infinite number of times where I have wanted to read a book I have heard about, and I've gone straight to the library and found it there. Also, because no video store exists in the town I live in, I go to the library for movies because I know they have a large selection. Some of the books and movies I or other people like @MONTH1 be found offensive to others, so if they were taken off of library shelves,I'm not sure if I would go to the library as often.     A third reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because people don't have to read what they @MONTH1 find offensive. Everyone has the choice of what materials they acquire from a library, unless it's something they have to read for school. If a person hears about a book that @MONTH1 be found offensive to them, why would they read the book. Also, if a person accidentally checks out a book or watches a movie from the library that they find offensive, they can always just stop reading the book or watching the movie.      Censorship shouldn't occur in libraries because everyone has different opinions. Libraries assume that if someone finds a material offensive, they'll just stop reading it. Also, if libraries take out all the materials anyone finds offensive, what will be left to read, watch, or listen to?

Should libraries be more careful about what they put out in their place of establishment? Of course they should. Libraries have all kinds of people walking in and out everyday. Certain rated material should be put in certain spots for certain people. The library should be more strict on the material that the people in the library look at on a day to day basis. Libraries need to become a little more organized.     Libraries have people that come in and out of the library everyday. People of all different ages and anyone is welcome to come in the library. With that being said, children of all ages come into the library all the time and pick all kinds of material. Children of course can't read everything in the library. They have to stay within their appropriate rated material selection. So if the library is more censored and strict about the material children can't get their hands on the material that they shouldn't be seeing at that time in their lives. You would want your seven year old child seeing inappropriate or offensive material, right.      Libraries should put the material that for adults eyes only in one completely different section of the library than what they would want the children that come to the library to see. With doing that it decreases the chances of the children getting a hold of material that they should see. Also, some books that the library think that some children should be able to see just might be offinsive to another set of people and wouldn't want their children to see. So books @MONTH1 show racism, or maybe another kind of discrimination and it @MONTH1 not be the goal of the book to make that suggestion but it still is in the book and in the wrong hands it can be a very bad thing especially in some childrens minds.      The libraries really need to just stop and think for a second is this book really appropriate for this age group or even for this establishment. Libraries have become where children are just checking out books by themselves and to me thats a problem. I think that children need a parents concent to check out a book from a library but do the libraries care, no. Library @MONTH1 check their inventory and notice a book @MONTH1 be missing but guess what, by that time its already to late. Children are able to just walk right out with books these days and know one will even think that they just took a book without checking it out. When children find a piece of material in a library and they know they aren't suppose to have it and they know they cant get out of the library with it they might decide to just take the book. The sercurity wont think twice to check the child and what is the result the childs mind is corrupted. Guess what you can blame it on the though the library. Isen't that something the child got the material from your friendly neighborhood library.     Oranization is the key. Libraries need to orginize their material better, plane and simple. It's really not that hard. They need to review the content that thier putting on the shelves in their establishment. I feel that the people at the library are lazy personally. If they just gave a little more effort maybe the children wouldn't get their hand on material that they have no buisness getting a hold of. Just pay attention to whats going on in the library. Their are books everywhere, right. Their are children, correct. The children @MONTH1 be in their appropriate rated section of the library but maybe a book from the adult section of the library stumbled over there by accident. Though it was an accident it still happened and it can be prevented and it should be prevented for the sake of the children. All we need is a little more organization.     As you can see from the following libraries just don't about our children as much as we do. It's okay that everyone is welcome in the library no questions asked but, they people need to stay in the designated place in the library. Children shouldn't be allowed in the adult section for saftey. Also a book from the adult side shouldn't be in the childrens section because anything can happen and corruption will rise. We need stricter libraries. Better sercurity to what they children are looking at and where the material is. Also the library really needs to look at the material and decide if it is appropriate for all the readers that @MONTH1 look at the material. Organization is the key to all our worries, if we use a bit more effort this won't be a problem anymore.

When I was in fifth grade, chaos broke out in my community. Everyone-- teachers, students, parents, school board members, community leaders-- had something to say about the topic at hand. This topic was censorship. A high schooler's parents were outraged that their daughter had read The @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 in class. In these parents' opinion, the rape scene in the book was far too disturbing for their precious daughter. While this seemed a fair stance to take, the parents then took things a step further. They sought to ban the book in the schools in our township, wanting to spare all other children the experience of being exposed to @CAPS1 was clearly traumatic material.  This crusade of theirs posed the questions '@CAPS1 can and should be censored? And when?'.     As the debate continued, I myself begin to ponder the subject.  Who had the right to tell me @CAPS1 I could read? Or listen to? Or watch?  The answer I came to was 'no one'.  No one has the right to censor anyone else.  This comes with one exception: parents and children. Parents have the responsibility to monitor their children. They must use their best judgement to decide @CAPS1 their children are old enough and mature enough to hear, see, or read. This was true in the censorship of @ORGANIZATION1, as well. No one fought back against the family because they did not want their own child to read the novel; it was only once they tried to keep others from the book that the problem arose.     This is why libraries should not remove materials from their shelves because they are, in the eyes of some, offensive materials.  Music you love @MONTH1 be offensive to me.  Books your @CAPS2 teacher assigned @MONTH1 not be appropriate for five year olds. Your friends @MONTH1 be offended by your favorite movie or @CAPS3 show.  These feelings are subjective; almost nothing is universally offensive or universally appropriate.  We must, as a society, be able to accept this.     We learn throguh @CAPS1 we see, @CAPS1 we hear, and @CAPS1 we read. These experiences teach us @CAPS1 to do, as well as teach us @CAPS1 not to do. Because of this, it would be unfair for materials to be removed from libraries based on solely opinions. To do that would be to steal from community members their chance to learn.       Parents have the right to censor @CAPS1 their children see, hear, and read, but even this censorship must be done carefully in order to not hinder the child's ability to learn. We must not hinder our children's ability to learn from the mistakes of book and movie characters, singers, comedians, and artists.  If we do take away that ability, we are setting these future adults up for making mistakes that could have been prevented by allowing them the chance to learn.  Removing materials from the shelves of libraries based solely on opinions is not only damaging to our society, but, ultimately, it is dangerous to the people we wish to protect

A curious child goes into the library for the first time to find a story to read. Yet, when she goes to the children's section, the book she wants is not allowed in this library becuase it is said to promote certain ideals to children. The child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book. The older sister is to busy looking for her own book. She had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic. She can't find the book she wants, the library has censored it.      Why would we censor librairies if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech? It is not right to censor libraries becuase that is restricitng what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom. The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. Will that be the next thing that is censored? A book is just like the newspaper, it is relaying a story to entertain the auidence that is reading it.      By censoring libraires that is taking away the freedom of speech. Writing is a way to express yourself. Authors share there expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance. Whether the book helps its reader to escape a horrendus day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager. I use books daily to escape the stresses of life, the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind, I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me.      Some @MONTH1 say that offensive things should be censored. In our culture the slightest thing can called 'offensive' now. If we never learn about these 'offensive' things how would we understand history? There will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it. By censoring these items we will never learn and  neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas.      Instead of censoring items, there is another solution. Make certain items restricted and red flagged. If certain items become restricted; it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. By doing this a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them. If there was a system to red flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose their selves to it if they did not want to, but others could. This would work becuase the books could stay in the library and still be used but there would be a warning system for those who do not want to be around it or allow their children to be around it.      In conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and speech.We are also making ourselves ignorant this way. If we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone. The 'offensive' matterial can stay in the libaries but people will know ahead of time what they are being exposed to and what their children are to

Have you ever read or seen a book that you thought was not appropriate? Did you want to ban the book from the library you got it from? Well many people have experienced this and many of them have wanted to have more sensorship in libraries but we can not always do this. Maybe that book that you just put down, deeming it inappropriate for all to read it, is someone else's favorite book. You @MONTH1 never know but maybe someone might think your favorite book is not appropriate. There are many different people in the world and they all have different opinions. So instead of banning them how about libraries and schools just sensor them.      Censoring seems like a no brainer but a lot of people do not think about it. We can not just close our eyes to all the inappropriate books out there but we can at least censor them. Censoring them could be as simple as just putting a tag on them or making a different section for just those kinds of books. The tags should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book.                    People do not have to get rid of some books completely but they need to recognize that young children could pick it up and start reading it without knowing that it is not very appropriate for them. Parents do have the right to check and monitor what their child is reading. Although if you just get rid of the book completely, people are also getting rid of other people's freedom of speech. No one has the right to determine what books are not appropriate and what books are, so no one should have the right to just have certain books just removed from the shelves.      Instead of banning the books or complaining about it them, people could try a rating system for books. When you buy movies a lot of times people check the rating on the movie to see if it would be appropriate for their child or even for themselves. This is what we could do with books too and maybe there will not be as many problems with books. It sounds simple enough but people need to take action and start to do something about it.     You @MONTH1 not be able to make everyone happy but at least people can be more informed about the books they are reading. If everyone can help out in the effort to make our libraries and school more censored than all the libraries would be a lot happier places full of adventure

Libraries are ment for all types of books, movies, music, magazines. It gives you a variety of things to look at or even check out. An offensive book or movie or even music shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because it has a few bad things in it. People @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree with this, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Through my own experiences, observations, and the reading I will help and explain my own opinion in why i dont think offensive books, movies,music, and magazines should not be taken off the shelf.     If a book is offensive it does not deserve to be taken off the shelf. Somebody most likley worked hard on that book so it could be put on to the shelf. If you find a book offensive it should be put off into a different section that tells you in head of time what books are in that section. I have not had any real experiences with this but I know people are awear of what are in the books before they're put onto the shelf and would therefore not put anything offensive next to a childrens book. Same thing with music and @CAPS1's. Music is music and it is there to be listened too. People like all types of music and have their favorite bands so if they dont like certain bands because they swear or whatever doesn't mean that album deserves to be taken off the shelf. @CAPS1's usually have the rating on the front so if it is not appropriate for your age than dont pick it up. If it has nudity or sexual content it will tell you or be put in a different section. For instance at my old library where I used to live in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 they would put all rated @CAPS2 movies into a different section and if you were going to check it out you would have to be @NUM1 or older or have a parent with you. It is really all up to the person, they could either make the right choice or the wrong choice. It's not the libraries fault if you pick up an offensive book because well, you should have some common sense.          The libraries shouldnt have to take offensive things off the shelfs because some people lack common sense or just dont know what they are doing. They could make more of an effort too kind of seperate bad from good, wrong from right, and even appropriate to non appropriate. But it is usually all up to the person making that decesion.                                                             - @PERSON1

I am writing this essay to puersuade the members of our local library to use better censorship when putting unfit material on the shelves for the members of our community to use. In this essay I will reflect my views of this subject, backed by true facts that I have learned from many passed experiences.     I believe that there is a large amount of reading material on the children section selves of our libraries that is far to advanced for many young children to understand. I myself have reviewed many of the books in the childrens section of many libraries. When doing so I noticed that many of the material makeing up this section is far to advanced or is to profound for children to absorb. Young children need to be reading more books of fantasy to allow them to use their imagiation more and not let their head be filled with thoughts of war and disaster. The children that read today need to have more material offered to them that they understand and not so much material that they can't comprehend. Lets use put more fit books on the selves of our library and quit wasteing our money on unfit books.     In reaching the conclusion of this article I hope that I have persueaded  the readers to understand the point I am trying to make. I hope my readers take the information I have givin and put it to work

Dear @ORGANIZATION1,     I think that it is wrong to remove offensive and other non offensive books from the shelves in the library just because one or two students do not like them or do not want to see others reading them.           Somethings are ok for reading and learning although they are indeed offensive it is ok for these matrerials to be left on the shelves, if it will be used for a good purpose such as learning and not just for fun. It is important for readers to be exposed to a broad spectrum of reading materials. Not only should they be exposed to some materials that are not so clean and normal but they should be introduced to things such as foreign writing. If we took everyting off the shelves that was a slight bit offensive or was not completely suited for readers would there be many books that would keep peoples atention?       In conclusion I strongly believe that these materials should be left on the shelf. These materials are important for learning in some cases and keep the readers attention. Keep these items on the shelves!

I do not believe that books should be removed from the shelve do to something offensive.Libraries are a very important aspect to life for most people nowadays. Mainly because where I live our city is working on a new plan to close the library nearby.For, me and my friends the library is very important because we do not have a computer in our home.The library has the internet and older books with information on the city.           Living in the society that we have now not every household can afford a computer with internet.Me myself living in one of those households.The library is a great quiet place to get your work done.Its also, provides the internet that people cant afford and need for everyday life.Every job application or school assignment is no longer on paper ,but online.      Being a @NUM1 grade student we have to alot of projects to do that require old books on the city and history.If they remove certain books of the shelve i @MONTH1 not be able to find important information that I need.Also, I know that every person has their own opinion on what is offensive to them ,however if everyone found something offensive in the book, movie or magazine does that mean it should be removed? If that happened there would be a very limited supply of books.    I have a friend who is mixed with mexican and sometimes she finds slavery very offensive ,but to me I believe that it is important for me to learn about my history.Proving that something that might be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive and maybe very important to the other.           In conclusion, I disagree with books being removed from the shelve due to offensive content I believe is wrong.Every person is different and find different things offensive ,but things should not be taken away from another person who @MONTH1 need it

Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense, they should still be left there. They are apart of our history and the history we're creating.     If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine, there's a big chance they will end up reading it. There are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today. You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the computer.     Also, censoring in libraries, where everyone feels tranquil and comfortable, can make people rebel and even put the library out of business.     From what i've observed, most people look up inappropriate or offensive things on the internet already. Especially if they know that it's something that could be debated about being censored.     A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics. Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them.     Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested? Everyone should have the right to these books, magazines, movies, and music. Libraries should not censor them.

I can think of several books that, I would not want a child of mine to pick up and read. I as soon as I seen what I was going to be writing about this one flashed in my head like lighting. The book that @CAPS1 choosing is called '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.'      The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' is about a young girl that grew up without a father. Her mother never wanted to talk about him because, she knew that this way only going to make matters worse. The young girl grew up with the dream of being daddy's little girl.That's all she wanted out of life. She sit and thought is that just a little to much to ask for.      After a few years, had passed by she had finally got the nerve to go on a hunt for father. She went by herself, leaving her mother behind.Her mother always pumped in the head that her father was up to no good. That she would be better off without him there. But, she went on the hunt of her father by faith in the lord.      After saying many prayers to the lord, she finally thought that.She just @MONTH1 knew what this hunt was going to take. So she went to her @CAPS9, hoping that she @MONTH1 just have the anwsers. That she needed to solve her heartace and pain. That she could just walk @CAPS4 knowing that somewhere out there in the world that her father would be waiting for her.       It's was just before the sun was beginning to sit, when she noticed a little old southern bell. Sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair. She went up to her @CAPS9 and kissed her on the forehead,with tears filled in her eyes.Her @CAPS9 said 'now dear why must you be crying.' @CAPS8, with the lump in the throat she asked 'do you know where I @MONTH1 find my father?' @CAPS9 answered with yes! Dear, @CAPS2's laying down in his bed. That's when her face began to glow.     She went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing her. She was nervous but with the help of her @CAPS9 she sit and talked with her father.Her father told her that her had wrote her a letter everyday.That's @NUM1 letters a year. She told her father that I've never recieved a letter from you in my entire life span. That's when it clicked to her that @MONTH1 be why her mother never let her check the mail.     After @NUM2 years had passed by she finally found her father. Truth was that her father @CAPS3 out of his daughters life because, the mother didn't want him to be a part of her life. She did whatever it took to keep them apart, even if that meant going aganist law orders. Father explained that her mother needed her there to look after her because, her was into some heavy drugs at the time. Back then there was nothing @CAPS2 could do to take his daughter @CAPS4 from her mother.      The reason I choose this book was because, when I was young my father did the same to me. @CAPS2 left me and I've never had the chance to get to know my family. The pain of growing up without either mom nor dad is tuff. You cry many tears and try to patch up the holes in you heart. Sometime's the bleed still seemeds to find it's way through. After reading the book I always wondered why they called her she. They called her she because, she took the blame for her father walking out of her life.      Many children are growing up without mom or dad. There's a higher percentange of single parent family's now days than before.Just like in the book most kids take the blame for a parnet not being there. If I could take that book off the shelf, then I would because, no child needs to be reminded of the pain they went through.Would you do the same if you were looking out for your child?      All these children want is to know there loved and that someone cares about them.If your going to have these types of books then there needs to be a form for the parnets to fill out giving permission. If they are over age then that's total fine. They're at the age where they should be able to handle it, than going through these feeling alone

I do believe that certain materials should be taken of the shelves if they are found offensive. I think children should only be able to read certain books cause, some books say things should know until they get older.Some books, music, movies , magazines should be removed if offensive. I think they shouldnt make some kids movies , books, music like that for little kids. They put to many things they should not  in kids movies.     The movie the @CAPS1 they should not let kids watch that movie its not a movie i would let my kids see until they was older.The reason why is cause it has alot of  bad language in it . It is about these guys who take ruphies. This guy cheats on his girlfriend, and it is just not a movie that i would let my kids watch.There are people getting drunk in the movie . they do stupied things.They try to make it look like its a good thing to do and that it is so fun to do all those things. I just think that is not a movie to let kids watch.   Some music has to much bad language in it. I think they should make better songs for kids. Songs that really mean something or about someone. Most of these songs they sing now is about dumb things that do not mean anything.I think some magazines are okay to read but some just talk about actors. Like @PERSON1 I read one time about here doing something that was bad, and she should not be doing. I think it depends on what the magazine is and what it talks about in it.   I believe that if they are offensive they should be taken of the shelves. I also think that if they are not offensive and do not talk about bad things kids should be able to see them or read them. If they did that kids would not talk and do things like they do today.That  kids would not try to stell and things like they do in these movies they see it happen or there friends do it. So they think it is cool for them to go out and do things like that but, it is not.

What if someone told you that you couldn't wear a yellow shirt because it was offensive? What if they said you couldn't look a certain way because you might offend somebody? Not just one person or group of people have the right to decide what is suitable and what is not. There are so many different religions and traditions throughout the @LOCATION2 it would be completely rediculous to set one standard for all people. If @CAPS1 aren't restricted when it comes to apperal, groceries, or automobiles, why should there be limits in the libraries? Libraries should not be censored because not only would censorship limit the resoursfulness of the libraries and smother the knowledge intake across the @LOCATION2, but it would also pose a threat to our future.      When one takes a trip to the library, one would expect to find a book, magazine, and/or movie on just about anything. It would be extremely frustrating to find that a library, which is supposed to contain content on nearly every subject, does not have what your looking for. Say a book on the asassination of @PERSON1 is what you fancy, so you ask the librarian where you could find it. You would be dissapointed if she says they don't carry assassination books because they are too vulgar for young children. This could become very troubling and would limit the library's resources.           Not only would censorship in libraries limit the content but it would also limit learning in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 are people supposed to stay informed if they are being sheilded from knowledge? Many people that do not have computers depend on the library. If they cannot get what they need at the library where would they go? The libraries would lose business and funding if they did not supply library-goers with the content which they desire. People would take their business elsewhere. Protests @MONTH1 break out and rebelious citizens @MONTH1 protest the censorship, causing an uproar in society.           The people would not be the only thing out of hand. The censorship would surely get out of hand, aswell. @CAPS1 are already being censored through news stations, radio, and tv shows. Libraries are a place where infinant knowledge is realistic and that is comforting for many @CAPS1. In libraries people choose what they learn: they aren't forced teachers or parents. The censorship @MONTH1 start out as a small intervention, but it could turn our nation upside down. Next thing we know, our desisions could be influenced by the books that only 'they' decide are suitable. What kind of society would we have then? Individuality would be lost and opinions would be forgotten.      Clearly, censorship in libraries is dangerous and unpredictable. If libraries were cencored, not only would  knowledge in the @LOCATION2 desinegrate, but libraries would lose their respect and threaten the future of @LOCATION1. No one tells me what to wear or say, so why should anyone tell me what to read? We are all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs. Our @CAPS4 @CAPS5 earned us our freedoms, we can not let censorship take them away

There is a certain amount of responsibility when it comes to censoring all the different types of media and literature. Deciding whose responsibility that is can be a difficult task. Children can be strongly influenced by all media out there and making that material has been made easily accessible. When someone comes of age to make decisions that affect their life then they should be able to. Shop owners should be able to sell whatever they want in order to make a living.     When children go to a library usually they will not do so alone. Parents can decide what their child is allowed to take home or not. When a child comes to their parent with a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive or inappropriate it comes to the parent to decide whether or not they want their child to be exposed to that material. If the parent allowed for their child to have access to offensive media then that can give the child the idea that what they are looking at or reading is alright.      If someone has come of age and has all the other freedoms that everyone else has they should be allowed to buy, read, and watch what they want. To prove to someone that you are of age to have access to offensive material you should have to show some sort of identification proving it.      A shop owner or businessman/woman should be able to sell whatever he or she wants to in order to make a living as long as it stays within the boundaries of the law. Having someone who does not work in the law or a person who is not a legal guardian or parent of someone who is not of age should not tell someone not to buy, read, or watch something just because it might be offensive or offend that one person.     I conclude that in order for a someone to tell another person not to buy or rent material that person would either have to be law enforcement or their legal guardian as long as they are not of age. There is no reason why people should not be able to access material that is not against the law. If someone is offended by some literature then they should try to make it against the law.

Today, we all have a very large variety of books to choose from when we enter a library. Some are childrens books, while others are intended for a more mature reader. Many parents are scared that their child will read a book that @MONTH1 be inappropiate for their child. The thing is, if everyone removes the books that they don't find acceptable, there won't be any books left in the library for us to enjoy.     What makes a book unacceptable to read? Could it be language, graphic scenes, or parts that are just extremely scary? Many people think that books like these should not be available for anyone to read. Removing a book from a library would be done through one's opinion. This is not fair because we all have the right to free press, which means that anyone can publish anything they wish to and everyone has the right to read it. By removing books from a library, you are violating not only the author's right, but the reader's as well.      Unfourtunately, there are some books that @MONTH1 cause a child to become scared. When a child reads a book, it's harder for them to realize that they are just reading a book. Many children take in every word of a story and turn it into a reality. Not only can this scare a child, but it makes it extremely difficult to explain that what they read in the story is not true. As more and more of these books are released, the more likely it becomes that children will be reading these offensive stories.     I believe that removing books from a library based on opinion is wrong. I understand that leaving these types of books out for children to read could cause a problem, but libraries are usually set up in sections. For instance, there is a childrens section, a teen section, and an adult section. This helps kids remain in an area appropiate for their age. I think that if a parent is worried enough that their child will read an offensive book, then they should go with their child to the library when checking out books to read.     A public library is designed to accompany a vast variety of readers. There will always be certain books that some of us find offensive. Removing books from a library only decreases the number of books to choose from; and if that were to happen, there would eventually be no books left for anyone to enjoy.

Just because I agree with something, do you have to agree too ? Your cousin believing in one thing,means you have to believe in it also? No,not in my opinion, and I hope not in yours either. If you were to see something you find offensive does that have to mean it offends another around you? The world contains things that children agree with and parents do not and this world consists of things that you like and others will not, but that does not make that item or that object invaluable or offending, and not the least bit inappropriate.      Objects containing so called offensive material are always going to exist in the world we live in and they have for a while. They are going to be everywhere;in stores , in schools, inside, outside , they are all around, and there is no reason for them to be a problem. They will not disappear and that is nothing we want to have to worry about,that could become a criminal offence of any sorts. So why fight it,well I say we don't.      Do you think that seeing an offensive item makes an area all the less attractive and good intended? What if something you liked ,was of an offence to another , does that make it all the more wrong for you to like it? Almost all the things and materials in this world are liked and disliked all based upon opinions. Nothing in this world exists without opinions. Life in itself can be an opinion.      I believe that if there is something in a library that is deemed offensive by one,it is not deemed offensive by all. Nothing should be removed from a shelf or a rack because another doesn't agree with it. Substitute other objects or ideas with this, if one person in the world was offended by another person would you just remove them from the human race? No, I sure hope you would not, but to some they @MONTH1 see that as their one resolution. Well me, I do not, and I'm a strong willed, strong opinionated person and to me that is all wrong.      Anything published or released to the world, to the public by someone means that is their way of expressing something, it is their way of living, and they have that right. That is who they are, and that is what they like,that is another person , anything we see or hear in this world is someone else because that has come from an individual who is equal to us,so why lessen there equivalence because its not the same way I feel? We @MONTH1 not all agree with their way of life, we @MONTH1 not agree with their choice of clothes, but how are we to know if we agree with their way of heart? No characteristic dictates the other characteristics of another,so why should an item?      A good thing to you could be a bad thing to another, and what if that disappeared? Taking a cd off a shelf will not vanish it from the world, it could be found somewhere else, but still that is like eliminating your hand because your fingers don't look like mine. Nothing can justify removing things from the stores and the world because one group of people don't understand it enough to feel the same and agree with it. Anything could be deemed inappropriate,but what if your vision of appropriate is anothers eye to inappropriate. Maybe there just is no line of the definition inappropriate,especially in the world we live in today.     If we start eliminating and removing everything we don't like, we would have nothing left, any and everything could be gone within a week or a month. People would take an inch to a mile , and erase everything, then we would start eliminating people we do not like , and it would all become a repeat. We learn about our history for a reason, does any of this resemble a situation or two the world has already been through? Erasing things from lives,have done no good before. If we start listening to the facts of people not agreeing with one thing, we will listen to the next, what happens when all the sudden the people come in again and say they do not like the women with blonde hair or the men with green eyes? The world will crash and burn before our eyes, and if I can identify these things at the age of fifteen, then some need to identify things at the age of fifty, accept that the world has its flaws too.      So just because I agree with everything I said , are you going to agree with it also? No I know you will not,but think about that when you expect others to agree with what you say or think. When I think of people reducing the things that they do not like, I can already see the world losing it's pathetic value it has earned, and we @MONTH1 not all be fond of this world but we cannot lose it. Eliminating the things you do not have a fatuation with will do no good, so maybe we should take into acceptance the different people we've been blessed with and love what we have. Accept the world as it is,because it is what you live in and it is what you have,because with out it nothing would be anything.Attempt to fix the broken things not eliminate the jagged things

Does censorship really helf or setback our libraries? Does it try to mask @CAPS7 really might be happening in this world or does it try to make you feel all happy about this horrendous place that you live in? To one person a book could be very offensive and to their neighbor it could have a whole new, opposite meaning. Its all in perspective.     Personally, i think that taking out some of the 'offensive' book in libraries could be a diaster. In one book that we read this year in my @CAPS1 class was '@CAPS2 @NUM1'. This book was all about a distopia where people burnt books who didn't send the right message to society. People were numb to feelings and that could be the outcome of censorship in the libraries around the @LOCATION1. Libraries are a place that sparks imangination for all ages and if you censor things out then how is that suppose to happen?     Looking at books in the past that were defied as 'offensive' and taken off of the shelves at libraries and banned to read in @CAPS1 class at school, were mostly about womens rights and @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Some of then just had bad words in them and others about dystopias. If you took out all af those books that pertained to these topics how many books would you ave left? And for that matter, my best friend is an @CAPS3 @CAPS6 girl and we both have equal rights now and we both have jobs so @CAPS7 is the big deal with living in the past? Theres is also the fact that it is innevitable to get away from cursing everywhere you go. All along the streets, in schools and sometimes even in church. So if you are around it in real life then why can't you read about it?     Now when people who are all for the cenorship in libraries say something to the affect of ' @CAPS7 about the children, i dont want them reading a book that i think is offensive,' i say then cenor them. Its your own choice on how you raise your kids but other parents think that you should have an imagination instead of the same old, same old. Its good to have a varity of things to read that doesn't limit the brain.      All in all, i think people who would want to censor books are crazy and it could potentually be taken way out of hand and then a distpoia society would form. Children should not be dissillusioned on @CAPS7 the world is and could be. Think about that next time that you think a book could arise tension between people and think are you taking away rights of other

Banned books.'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work that I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'                                                         Katherine Paterson                                                          Author     I believe and will stand by katherine's statement above. Who @CAPS5 to say if a book @CAPS5 offinsive? People have a right to their oppinion, but i do not think any one has the right to take books away from a @CAPS1 library.      @CAPS1 library, the facts are in the name. It @CAPS5 a @CAPS1 library, where people can go and find a book to pass time, a book to use on an @CAPS2 assignment, or a book to read to their child. Taking a book off the shelves just because it offendid someone does not makes sense to me. A person can pick up a book, be offended and complian about it, that @CAPS5 freedom of speech. I do not see fault in that. But when a person picks up a book, @CAPS5 offendid,and demand that the book per se @CAPS5 taken off the shelves of a @CAPS1 library. That @CAPS5 when i have issues seeing where they think they have the right.     Katherine Paterson said in her text that 'If i have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work i abhor- then you aslo have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelve for any of us.' @CAPS3't that a scary thought? If a person was offended by a book they could take it off the shelve at his or her own will? I fear the out come of that. I am sure that a person could figure out something offensive about any book.      Taking books off the shelve @CAPS5 taking knowledge away from the people. We as @CAPS4 have the right to read at our pleasure, any book that we have the slighest whim to read, and be able to read that book with out prosecution from a people that find the book in question 'offensive.'     The day we let people take books off the shelves because they offend them, @CAPS5 the day our first admendment fails. As a nation we need to stand stron againts banning books from @CAPS1 libraries. For our generation and for the many generations to follow.

Books mean a lot to people that love to read. Books have pictures, or they @MONTH1 even be poem books. Some books should not be on the shelves in libraries. They have offesive language and not so well of pictures. They @MONTH1 be learning books but the little kids do not need to see that. I think books should be removed from the shevles if found offensive.      Libraries need to up their standards of what should be in the library and what should not. The books, movies, music, ect. needs to be in a certain section of the library to where the little kids can not go or reach. A library is a family place not a fun zone for adults.     On @DATE1, I went to the library with my brother to pick out a book for him. @CAPS2 is only six about to be seven. He had told me he wanted to get a book about dinosuars, but I told him to get one on space and aliens. @CAPS2 was very into reading. He  read to our mom everynight before he would go to bed. We were walking down @CAPS1 street when a bolt of lighting struck through the trees. 'ekkkk!' said @CAPS2 as he ran around me. We walk into the library and the old lady at the front desk says, 'there is a huge storm coming.' We sorta ignore her and go on about our bussiness picking our books for @CAPS2. @CAPS2 and I walk up stairs to the childrens section. @CAPS2 is looking around and he says 'hey kayla, what is this and he picks up a naughty magaizine. i rush over to snach it out of his hands and he gets scared. He ask 'but sissy what is that?' I do not respond. I tell him to pick a book and come on. He grabs one and we are on our way to get it checked out and the lights go off. It was completely dark. '@CAPS3 stay calm.' a man says. The back up lights come on and we all go to the lobby area. We sit there for twenty mins and the lights are back on. Everything is normal again and we go to check out. We get up to the front and i turn in the bad magazine that @CAPS2 had found. The lady askd why I was bringing it to her and i had to tell her the bad news, that it was up in the childrens section. She said 'oh my!' @CAPS2 laid his books up on the counter and we checked out. We walked out the front doors and we were on our way home.

Some people @MONTH1 think that certain book, movies, magazines, or music should be removed from libraries because they @MONTH1 be found offensive. I believe that libraries should not rid their shelves of 'offensive' material.      What really makes something offensive? If someone were to tell me that it looked as if I've lost weight, I would find that offensive. The person wouldn't have meant it that way, though. Although I would have found it slighly rude, another person @MONTH1 have found it to be a nice compliment. With this logic, can one really conclude that anything is truely offensive? By saying something is offensive, you're stating your own opinion. Even if they aren't the same as everyone else's, everyone is intitled to their own opinions; equality is something most people find very important. Because of this, one person's definiton of offensive shouldn't be held higher than another's. If we rid libraries of 'offensive' material, that is exactly what you would be doing; you'd be making one person's definition of offensive superior to another person's.      I also believe libraries should not get rid of 'offensive' material because by doing so, they would probably be getting rid of a lot of interesting material. Let's use my religious beliefs for an example. I am @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Basically, I do not believe in '@CAPS3'. If someone were to write a book about my religion, I would find it interesting. Some @CAPS4 @MONTH1 find it to be offensive, though. So if a library got rid of that book because someone found it offensive, I wouldn't want to go there as often. When I go to a library, I want to find a book that I'd enjoy reading. If all the material that is found offensive was taken out of the library, would there really be anything left? If so, I doubt many people would find it interesting.      I also believe this because by taking a book off the shelf because you find it offensive, wouldn't you be offending the author? As I said before, everyone is intitled to their own opinions. Because of this, libraries should allow authors to speak their minds. By taking their books off the shelves, you'd be offending them. They took their time and effort to think about and write that book, and for you to offend them by taking it off the shelf, you'd be controdicting the entire purpose of removing it from the shelf.      In conclusion, I believe that nothing can truely be defined as offensive. Also, people should be able to speak their minds. Therefore, libraries should not attempt to rid there shelves of 'offensive' material

Censorship      @CAPS1 you are trying to find the right book, music, movie, magizine, you @MONTH1 come across some interesting ones. Should libraries ban certain books just because of some contend on one page? The person has that ability to read that book or not.      Banning books has been a huge problem in today's society and needs to be stopped. People should be old enough to choose a book that they enjoy and not have to worry about, does this libary have the book that I want. They should not have to think that way @CAPS1 going to a library. @CAPS1 you think of some of the worst books out there, who would want to read those anyway. Many books that people think are bad just have a terrible word on one page. They do not think that they are banning a perfectly good book for others. @PERSON2's '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' was a big upror wheather or not to put the book on the shelfs. The book intailed the @CAPS4 word, and some people were not pleased in this sequence. The book was very well written and just had a few bad words. Should a few bad words keep a book from being a prize winner. The book was such a great story and should be read by many people and should not be kept in a storage room in boxes.      There are many ways to keep a certain age from gettting a certain book. The library could put those certain books in @CAPS5 own part of the library. Keeping the books in a different part of the library might be a better suited way instead of banning the books altogether. The book still will be censored to be in that section or not, but we still will have those wonderful books that we all love so much. What if there was a great informative book about how to do a certain task and no one knew how to do it. That book contained bad language, should the health and knowledge of the world go down because of some bad material in a book, that could help us in the near future.      Authors have just the same right as we do. They should get a say in wheather @CAPS5 own book is liable to be on the shelfs. The government should not get all the say in this series matter in hand. The community and the author that writes it should get more of the say then anyone else. @CAPS1 an author writes a novel they think of the great content they are putting into this great piece of art not thinking of, is this suitable for children to read. The author just loves to write and should not have to think of all the concerns that they should just not worry about.      There is this book we read this year called '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 Are @CAPS7 @CAPS8'. This book had language that I do not think would be suitable for others in some content that was in the novel. Now do I think the the novel should be banned from a library? No, because it used the words in a very nonviolent way. @CAPS1 reading it I felt that I was not harmed by the content and neither were any of my fellow classmates. @PERSON1 was the author of this book and I thought she did an excellent job of writing this piece of literature. So the next time you think of banning a book think of all the warm hearts you could be crushing
