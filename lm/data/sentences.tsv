0	2978	Certain materials being removed from libraries such as books, music and magazines, shouldn't be removed from the libraries	0
1	2978	It gives people a chance to understand how the real world @CAPS2	1
2	2978	Having certain materials such as books and music definitly should not be removed, because most books and music can show most people how bad the statement in the book @CAPS2 or how bad the lyrics are in a song, and help that person to avoid that type of thing that the book or song @CAPS2 saying to the reader or listener	2
3	2978	People should give every type of music at least a try and not always doubt what they hear about what people say about that type of music	3
4	2978	I always hear about people saying how bad the band @PERSON1 A.M	4
5	2978	@CAPS2, just because in the lyrics it talks about drugs and how much cursing each song has	5
6	2978	Really the band @CAPS2 talking about one mans life and how he turns his life from being a drug addict to having the best life someone could ever live	6
7	2978	People always doubted him and never gave his music a chance	7
8	2978	Another example would be @PERSON1's book, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' for it talks about drug addicts, homeless people, people who have been born with disfigured arms or even someone who lost there legs, and telling how beautiful each and everyone of them really are	8
9	2978	His book taught me a few things and made me think different about people	9
10	2978	It doesn't matter how they look or how they talk, no matter what, that person @CAPS2 beautiful	10
11	2978	As far as movies and magazines has gone within the last few years, I think that the also shouldn't be taken from libraries	11
12	2978	I think @CAPS1 for the same reason of how I feel about the books and music	12
13	2978	Of course we see previews of movies and think that they @MONTH1 not be good, but libraries shouldn't keep leave them out	13
14	2978	Movies @CAPS2 a great way to learn how to treat others and how to act around other people when you don't know how to act	14
15	2978	If you act differently around people that you've never been around before, then you could feel embarassed or maybe even get @CAPS4	15
16	2978	Movies can help people learn about the real world by seeing how to do those type of things as we get older	16
17	2978	Same goes with the magazines, they also help people see what not to do or to help them understand the consequences of something that shouldn't be done	17
18	2978	Knowing what to do from a magazine could possible save your life or perhaps maybe even someone elses life	18
19	2978	I don't understand why some libraries would want to banned certain materials to help people understand the things that happen in someone elses life and to help them not make the same mistakes as that person once did.	19
20	2981	In @DATE1's world, there are many things found offensive	0
21	2981	Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not	1
22	2981	Many parents are becoming upset because they think their children are viewing things that they should not	2
23	2981	Other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life	3
24	2981	This is even taken to the extreme where people want censhorship on libraries to avoid this, which is wrong	4
25	2981	Some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries	5
26	2981	They find these things to be offensive	6
27	2981	Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended	7
28	2981	The world is a public place and everywhere we go, something might be found offensive	8
29	2981	The library is a place for study	9
30	2981	It is never intended to offend someone, or bring bad to the world	10
31	2981	It is simply a place to inform, and if someone is offended by what they see, they should stay away from the library	11
32	2981	I have been to the library many times, none of which have I ever seen anything offensive	12
33	2981	Everything I have ever witnessed at the library is for learning and research	13
34	2981	There are certain sections in the library	14
35	2981	If a parent does not want their child seeing something, they should keep their child in the children's section	15
36	2981	I can assure you, there is nothing offensive in the children's section, or else the library would not have it in that section	16
37	2981	The owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not	17
38	2981	If there was truly offensive materials in the library, those materials would be taken out	18
39	2981	Also, if a person complains, and the materials are removed, it could lessen someone else's chance getting the materials they need	19
40	2981	One person could think the material is offensive, but someone else might want to learn more about it	20
41	2981	If one is offended by a certain material, all they simply must do, is not look at it	21
42	2981	The library can be compared to a big computer	22
43	2981	One can basically find anything there	23
44	2981	Asking the library to censor their materials is like asking the internet to censor theirs	24
45	2981	It is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there	25
46	2981	Everyone is going to be offended some point in their life	26
47	2981	If the libraries removed everything that could offend someone, they would have no materials left	27
48	2981	People need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone	28
49	2981	There does not need to be any censorship in libraries	29
50	2981	It is simply trying to teach people about the world and let them enjoy books, music, movies, or whatever else one might go to the library to find.	30
51	2982	In life you have the 'offensive things'	0
52	2982	The little stuff that gets under our skin and eats away at us	1
53	2982	No it is not easy to get over ,but these things will make you stronger	2
54	2982	Sometimes there are books, magazines, music and movies  that offened us	3
55	2982	The only reason why we get offensive is because the subject either reflects our personality, or our life	4
56	2982	It's not the authors fault, they write what they feel and what is the truth	5
57	2982	Okay, so libraris are full of book's, movies, music, etc	6
58	2982	You can't just take books off the shelves, just because they offened you	7
59	2982	Other people @MONTH1 like the book you hate	8
60	2982	There are more books in the library you can read	9
61	2982	Another reason people shouldn't remove offensive material out of the library	10
62	2982	it will hurt whoevers' company got the book published and also the writters	11
63	2982	Writters and publishers would lose so much money because the library sells' there books,magazines, movies	12
64	2982	They make thousands of copies of thier product, which takes money	13
65	2982	So to make thier money back ,they sell to thousands of book stores	14
66	2982	Must of the offensive material will open the worlds eye's	15
67	2982	Everybody needs to see whats going on in the world	16
68	2982	Books, newspapers tell the truth about a subject	17
69	2982	Now the writters intent is'nt to hurt you but to help you	18
70	2982	Why cant the world be more open	19
71	2982	I know in my own life i have read books that at first ,the book offended me	20
72	2982	I would get so mad, i would put the book down and walk away	21
73	2982	But then,my eyes would open and finaly it hit me	22
74	2982	The offensive part out of the book helped myself relives a new understanding	23
75	2982	The views i used to have would be gone	24
76	2982	It is strange how you finnaly open up, and your life changes	25
77	2982	Some people might even find this paper offensive	26
78	2982	But if nobody is stepping on your toes, and getting under your skin you wont ever change	27
79	2982	Offened is a word used lightly	28
80	2982	yes, people use it a lot but do they really mean it	29
81	2982	Some people need to use 'well this book bugs me'	30
82	2982	Stop being about yourselves and get over it	31
83	2982	Life is to short to worry and feel offended	32
84	2982	Every single book, magazine,movie and music needs to be left alone	33
85	2982	Those materials @MONTH1 reflect other peoples life and help others with thiers'	34
86	2982	Just read another book, or watch a different move	35
87	2982	Please do not remove anything from the selves, because it will only do more damage	36
88	2983	A lot of @CAPS3 today are censored because of the content in books, music, movies, and Magazines	0
89	2983	I think that it all can be fixed if you have certain sections, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and my views on the censorship of @CAPS3	1
90	2983	Here's my idea to fix the problem	2
91	2983	I understand that books and other material @MONTH1 offend certain people, but it might not offend others	3
92	2983	Thats why I think @CAPS3 should have a room for things that might offend certain people	4
93	2983	The sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room	5
94	2983	There could be seperate rooms for children	6
95	2983	It has nothing but children's books, movies, music, and magazines	7
96	2983	Its a great idea because your child would'nt be open to the bad content	8
97	2983	This brings me to my next topic	9
98	2983	You must be a certain @CAPS1 to enter the 'bad content' room	10
99	2983	I dont think the library staff or their parents want a five-year old boy checking out a book that deals with sex, drugs, and alcohol	11
100	2983	The library could get in a lot of trouble	12
101	2983	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 could be @NUM1 years of @CAPS1 to enter the room	13
102	2983	That seems fair enough	14
103	2983	Your old enough to be able to handle the content	15
104	2983	I dont get offended easily, so I can read just about anything	16
105	2983	Like I suggested previously in the article, the bad content should be moved to a room so that people dont mistakenly come across it	17
106	2983	I like reading about anything and everything, so I would love to read things and spark my attention	18
107	2983	Books like that usually deal with bad things	19
108	2983	I'm okay with that, but I understand that others are not	20
109	2983	Seperate rooms, @CAPS1 limits, and my views are all good ideas	21
110	2983	Maybe a library will come across my article and do what I have said	22
111	2983	I think that will be very affective	23
112	2983	I hope to start seeing that in the future	24
113	2984	How @CAPS4 you feel if your favorite book was taken off the shelves of your school or public library	0
114	2984	I, along with many other students, @CAPS4 find this discouraging and distastrous, so I do not believe that censorship should affect books that are on the shelves	1
115	2984	Otherwise, a demolished love of reading, crushed individuality, and separated population @MONTH1 be born	2
116	2984	Like the beloved @PERSON2 @PERSON2 series by @PERSON1, many books and series are being taken out of libraries' collections due to people in society finding them offensive	3
117	2984	In this case, the world of witchcraft in which this story blooms is against some religious beliefs	4
118	2984	therefore, some individuals within a religion campaign to have these books banned	5
119	2984	Fortunately, none of the libraries I visit, with their eclectic collections, had banned this series, or I @CAPS4 not have the strong thirst for literature as I do now	6
120	2984	All books have the potential to pull a student into the wonderful world of reading, like @PERSON2 did for me, so taking away books that are most likely to spark an interest or start a firework of creativity @CAPS4 not only affect this generation, but the futures of all	7
121	2984	If this censorhip was to be allowed, who is to say what all  could be censored	8
122	2984	Who @CAPS4 be the final judge as to what books @CAPS4 be banned	9
123	2984	It @CAPS4 all come down to power and who was willing enough to take it	10
124	2984	This struggle to be on top has the possibility of seperating people apart like political parties	11
125	2984	Disagreements could turn into debates, and those could turn into fights	12
126	2984	It can be concluded that people are stubborn for their beliefs, and to have someone choose what everyone is allowed to believe @CAPS4  be wrong	13
127	2984	For instance, it @CAPS4 be like an @CAPS1 forcing a @CAPS2 to not believe in @CAPS3	14
128	2984	a vegetarian commanding that meat can no longer be eaten	15
129	2984	a woman taking away men's voting rights	16
130	2984	Censorship @CAPS4 lead to the disrespect of other's opinions, and disrespect is never a beneficial thing	17
131	2984	Each and every person has a different opinion on what is offensive or not, so to censor books @CAPS4 be to censor all individual mentality	18
132	2984	Without each person's unique thoughts and beliefs, the world @CAPS4 become similiarly vapid and dull	19
133	2984	Differences in beliefs is what adds variety to the population and what makes a person special	20
134	2984	additionally, free thought is a right all people should have	21
135	2984	If someone was to limit the mental, literary stimulants that are out in the world, the amount of creativity and individuality @CAPS4 decrease	22
136	2984	To conclude, censorship @CAPS4 be a disrespect to individuality, personal beliefs, and the overall joy of reading a good book	23
137	2984	Just because one might not believe in what a story says, it does not mean that the piece of literature should be forbidden	24
138	2984	No one is being forced to read the books that grace the hundreds of shelves in a library, so if someone is offended, simply do not read it	25
139	2984	So how @CAPS4 you feel if your favorite book was gone from all libraries	26
140	2984	Disrespected	27
141	2984	That is how I @CAPS4 feel	28
142	2986	The idea of the removal of 'offensive' material from libraries is understandable	0
143	2986	Some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view	1
144	2986	However, because we all have different opinions on what is offensive, I believe that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the library	2
145	2986	First, I believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries, there would not be many books left on the shelf	3
146	2986	Offensive is a relative word	4
147	2986	What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be to another	5
148	2986	Every has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences	6
149	2986	Many books have things people disagree with, but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech	7
150	2986	Therefore, if everyone complained that they found a certain book or movie to be offensive, there would hardly be anything left, as Katherine Paterson said	8
151	2986	The purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource	9
152	2986	If the sources were censored in such a way, it would be hard to get information	10
153	2986	Sometimes, it is beneficial, even, to read an opposing view or side to have more knowledge on a certain topic and see things from a different perspective	11
154	2986	However, some books @MONTH1 not be entirely appropriate to certain people	12
155	2986	For example, some material in the library @MONTH1 not be best for small children to read or view	13
156	2986	In this case, I do not necessarily feel that they should be removed from the shelves rather than placed in an area these children do not have access to	14
157	2986	Having books, music, movies, or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion, a ridiculous notion	15
158	2986	It hinders expression	16
159	2986	People have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same	17
160	2986	If someone finds something particularly offensive, I believe they just should not view it	18
161	2987	All authors write for a purpose, whether it be to teach, entertain, or persuade an audience	0
162	2987	No author writes something and says, 'I hope no one picks this off of the shelf!' So, if every author wants to express something through their writing, then why should we not let them be heard	1
163	2987	We all have the freedom of speech, right	2
164	2987	So, why not the freedom of writing	3
165	2987	Libraries should not remove a book, music, movie, or magazine from the shelf just because they found it offensive	4
166	2987	Everyone will read a book that they don't like, its natural, but that doesn't mean that no one will like it	5
167	2987	Authors write for an audience, but maybe you are not in that audience	6
168	2987	so, it doesn't appeal to you and might even seem offensive	7
169	2987	Not everyone believes in the same ideas	8
170	2987	You could think about an issue one way and your neighbor think about it a totally different way	9
171	2987	Like for instance, you're reading a book about a young girl that is going through many problems in her life	10
172	2987	She has gotten into some really horrible situations	11
173	2987	Some of these situations you read about are so awful that you wouldn't want anyone else to read it	12
174	2987	But, did you ever think that maybe there's another girl that is or has gone through some of these same situations	13
175	2987	Maybe this girl comes to a library and finds this book	14
176	2987	suddenly she finds guidence in it	15
177	2987	She finds something she can depend on in her life that she's never had before	16
178	2987	She feels like she has a friend in this book that can handle the situations with her	17
179	2987	So, would you really want to take that book off of the shelf and not let that girl ever find her guidence	18
180	2987	Situations happen like this all of the time	19
181	2987	People find something special in what they read that other people might not find	20
182	2987	When a librarian takes a book off of that shelf, an opportunity is forever gone	21
183	2987	No one will ever be able to learn of what was to become of that writing and of those ideas	22
184	2987	We all have a right to learn, to explore new ideas, and to expand our minds	23
185	2987	No one should have the right to take that away	24
186	2988	Have you seen a magazine, book, movies, etc., that are found affensive	0
187	2988	What experiences did you have	1
188	2988	Here is my opinion on if I think that those books should be removed or not	2
189	2988	I have noticed that some movies are affensive to other people	3
190	2988	Like for an example, the @CAPS1 movies, books is about @CAPS2 and some people don't believe in them or they don't like the movie so I do kind of see no point of making a movie that is about someone that is not real	4
191	2988	However, some movies are okay for some people and their age	5
192	2988	The movies that are rated '@CAPS3' are for the people who shouldn't be watching it yet like kids under the age	6
193	2988	Magazines though do have some type of thing that I think that is affensive to other people	7
194	2988	Like, I don't remember the name of them but they would have sections that would talk bad about another person like one of the kids would talk about the president or something like that	8
195	2988	So I think some magazines should be removed off the shelves	9
196	2988	The books however, I don't see a reason why to have them removed off the shelves	10
197	2988	I don't think the books seem to be affensive as much as graphical	11
198	2988	There could be some books out there that might be affensive to people though, like the ones that talk about a family that has no money or talk bad about them	12
199	2988	For an example, you would be able to find a book and read it and find out that it is talking bout things that you don't want to know yet or want to know	13
200	2988	So as you can see I have made an opinion on what they should do either keep the books, magazines, or movies off the shelf	14
201	2988	But then I do see it the other way to	15
202	2988	Some of us do like those kind of movies or book or even magazines and think that is very cool or interesting	16
203	2989	Personally I don't think libraries, movie stores, etc., should be selling any of the items just mentioned	0
204	2989	If they are found offensive to the public	1
205	2989	I think it offends lots of people	2
206	2989	Citizens such as senior citizens and children shouldn't have to be exposed to inaproppriate material	3
207	2989	I think in order to buy or rent certain books, music, movies, or magazines you should have to be at least eight-teen years of age	4
208	2989	The economy is bad enough the way it is	5
209	2989	There is a new generation of people who are being raised at the moment, and they should't have to look back at their childhood and have memories of seeing offensive movies, or reading offensive books and magazines	6
210	2989	I think music is what influences a person the most	7
211	2989	If they are constantly listening to foul language and what not, that is going to just stay into a persons mind	8
212	2989	I know this from experience	9
213	2989	I also believe that movies influence a peron lot too	10
214	2989	For example, a kid goes to see a movie that has a lot of violence in it	11
215	2989	Well after he is done watching the movie he thinks to himself, 'well it must be okay to kill someone because i saw someone kill another person because they got away with it and never got into trouble.' That is just one example of how the humans mind can change	12
216	2989	In conclusion I do believe that humans have the right to read, watch, or listen to what they want	13
217	2989	I just think that people should have to be a certain age for some of the things though	14
218	2989	Also, I think that anything citizens find offending should be hidden in some sort of area in a store or library	15
219	2989	So that  just people who want a certain item or whatever can get it with out other people having to see or listen to anything offending	16
220	2990	A library is a place you can go to read, write, and relax	0
221	2990	Nowadays, many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there	1
222	2990	Even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship	2
223	2990	Censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy	3
224	2990	First of all, removing classics from the shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 offend certain people is completely unwarranted	4
225	2990	If they offend you then do not read them	5
226	2990	It is as simple as that	6
227	2990	Many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs	7
228	2990	A great example of this is the @PERSON2 series	8
229	2990	@PERSON2 @PERSON2 is a bestselling series with over a million copies that have been sold worldwide	9
230	2990	however, it does not corrolate with many people's beliefs	10
231	2990	Therefore those people boycott the series	11
232	2990	I remember several years ago I attended a @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released	12
233	2990	While I was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing	13
234	2990	Now most people would think that it was only a storm, but the people in town who did not like the @PERSON2 books blamed it on the party	14
235	2990	They said that we were worshipping the devil and @CAPS4 brought the storm to tell us that what we were doing was wrong	15
236	2990	I know many people do not like the @PERSON2 series because there is witchcraft and wizardry in it, but that does not mean that they should blame natural occurences on a book	16
237	2990	Even great novels like the @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 should not be banned because of their content	17
238	2990	For a while, @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 was reading material for school, but then the 'morality police' banned it because it was about a crazy person	18
239	2990	Books should not be required to meet everyone's personal standards	19
240	2990	Consequently, what Katherine Paterson states is true	20
241	2990	If we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable, eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library	21
242	2990	Although there could be a way to compromise	22
243	2990	If the books with questionable content had a sticker on them telling the reader that, then it could benefit both sides	23
244	2990	In conclusion, eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all, especially children	24
245	2990	When I was young I would always want to be read to and when I continued to age I would always read	25
246	2990	While I was in middle school every day I would have a book with me to read	26
247	2990	Books allow the reader to travel to far off places or see what it would be like to walk in someone else's shoes	27
248	2990	Books are a gateway to another world	28
249	2990	Why take that magic away from children	29
250	2991	Yes and no, some materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be voted upon the citizens to be removed from shelves	0
251	2991	I do think that some materials in those catagories should be removed if they are offensive to me as well as others, but it will take a long while to get them removed from stores and other places if other people like them	1
252	2991	I do not like how they make some music to be very violent and cause minds of most teenagers to turn bad and start selling drugs on the street of their hometown, but i can't do anything about that because that kind of music is admired by those teenagers as well as some adults too	2
253	2991	If some people can buckle down and see that stuff like that will mess up lives of teenagers and some adults who fall victim to it, then there is a chance that it can be stopped	3
254	2991	Stopping things like this will save a community from disaster and cause other good chances in life for people in need for those chances	4
255	2991	Here's another example, like this music artist named @CAPS1 @CAPS2	5
256	2991	She has made some great songs for the past year and a half now	6
257	2991	People have told me that she is part of a group called @CAPS3 and its a group where they try to I think 're-birth' thereselves	7
258	2991	My friends wanted me to stop listening to her music	8
259	2991	I told my friends that I do not like the fact that she joined this group, but that doesnt mean im gonna stop listen to her music	9
260	2991	Now if she makes a song that is offensive to me and as well as my friends, then that where I draw the line	10
261	2991	What im saying is that if people don't have others to back them up if something is highly offensive to them and oblivious to others, it will be very hard trying to prove yourself in the best way possible.	11
262	2993	Dear Newspaper,     @CAPS1 would you feel if someone wrote a book about @CAPS1 bad the newspapers are, and the tore you down so bad no one wanted to touch another newspaper	0
263	2993	Think about it if something is found offensive should it be avalible for thousdands and thousands of other people to read	1
264	2993	I believe that certain materials such as books, music,movies,ect	2
265	2993	that are found offensive should not be allowed to be removed from a libraries book shelves, let alone even be on the shelves	3
266	2993	Now lets just think about this for a moment.What if a sexist book fell into the hands of an inocent childs hands that could just read enough to get through the book	4
267	2993	That child could end up living that kind of life that the book protays	5
268	2993	If I were a parentt I know for a fact I would never want my children exposed to harmful reading materials until they know right from wrong, and have a clear judgement on it	6
269	2993	Or from another perspective what if that  one book, about @CAPS1 black people are bad and nasty, fell into the wrong hands for this purpose lets say a drunken, old fashioned man	7
270	2993	Who just so happens to think we should continue slavery	8
271	2993	That one book could stimulate this white mans thoughts and he could try to put his thoughts into action	9
272	2993	Throwing what that book says about black people in a young black womans face	10
273	2993	Then continues ,after seeing what that alone has done to her, rapes and beats her	11
274	2993	Only to let her live and make her his own whore or slave for aslong as shes living	12
275	2993	Can you imagan this world when @CAPS2 only knows @CAPS1 bad this woman is hurting	13
276	2993	@CAPS2 is the only one who know @CAPS1 long she will deal with the pain.Before she stops fighting for her life	14
277	2993	Just think all that I have told you about, gave you examples of all started with that one single book.The offensive book towards sexists and towards black people	15
278	2993	these are all reasons for those book to be ban from libraries or at least glued to the shelves.	16
279	2994	A lot of people that are in school have probably seen or heard of a book or magazine that had profanity or offended them	0
280	2994	Some people think that kind of thing is funny, but to others it @MONTH1 bother them	1
281	2994	Not only racial slurs can offend people, but profanity can make someone disappointed	2
282	2994	Some parents do not want their child to hearing or saying things like that	3
283	2994	And I believe if it is offensive it should be taken off the shelf in a library and you should too	4
284	2994	The movies and music I think if it really offended somebody that they should have to either change the lyrics or get rid of it	5
285	2994	They just should not offend somebody to be a good song or a really great movie	6
286	2994	You can't not make something that is making fun of another race or a movie of killing them	7
287	2994	Going to like school libraries, for books I think it really depends on the age group	8
288	2994	Like their should not be anything that would be offensive or profanity in the @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS4	9
289	2994	They are just not old enough or mature to be seeing or reading those things in books or magazines	10
290	2994	So if a student comes home with a book the class is reading and the parent doesn't like the content they should have the right to say that they don't want their child reading it	11
291	2994	And if was really bad be able to take it out of the school	12
292	2994	Even @CAPS3 @CAPS4 that have more mature students get offended sometimes from the books their reading in school	13
293	2994	One in example is 'To @CAPS5 a @CAPS6'	14
294	2994	Even though it is a really good book and a lot of @CAPS4 read it	15
295	2994	A lot of @CAPS7 @CAPS8 might get offended by all the racial slurs about @CAPS7 @CAPS8	16
296	2994	They just do not feel comfortable fellow students saying them and their teachers saying them	17
297	2994	And the @CAPS4 or libraries just should not make students read books that they don't feel comfortable reading	18
298	2994	Or the libraries having books like that	19
299	2994	Me in example, next year I'm going to have to read that book and I am just not going to like it	20
300	2994	I'm half @CAPS7 @CAPS12 and I do not like people saying things like that	21
301	2994	It is going to be a really akward moment for me	22
302	2994	And I have some other friends that have read that book that didn't feel comfortable reading that book	23
303	2994	Their are even little kid books that parents want out of their childs school library	24
304	2994	The most challenged book in school libraries is @CAPS13 @CAPS14	25
305	2994	I know this because my librarian told me this one day	26
306	2994	It is just a good book, but some parents don't want their kids reading about witchcraft and wizards	27
307	2994	So they try to get them out of the library	28
308	2994	And they should if the parents do't want their kids reading it	29
309	2994	I just think if their is a certain amount of people complaining about a movie or song that their should not even be a fight about it	30
310	2994	They should just get rid of it	31
311	2994	Same thing in a school, if their is students or parents that are complaining and their is a certain amount of them, the librarian should not even have a say in it or the school	32
312	2994	They should just get rid of the book or magazine	33
313	2994	I believe that if it a book, song, movie , etc is offensive to a certain amount of people that it should just be taken care of by getting rid of it	34
314	2994	Parents might not want their kids seeing, hearing, or reading that sort of stuff	35
315	2994	And some people get offended by some books or movies	36
316	2994	Or they just do't feel comfortable	37
317	2994	I believe that things that are brought to the world for entertainment should also be able to get out of the world if people are offended by it.	38
318	2995	Do you think that if certain books, music, movies, and magazines shout be removed from shelves because someone finds them offensive	0
319	2995	Such as magazines, books, movies, and even music	1
320	2995	I simply do not find any of it right that few peoples opinion's should matter depending on what they find offensive for two reasons	2
321	2995	Those reasons being that you picked it out yourself and that you have traveled to the library looking for something you will enjoy	3
322	2995	The first reason I think that certain books, music, movies and magazines should not be removed form the shelves are because people have picked them out there selves	4
323	2995	Noone is ever going to pick up a book or magazine or even watch movies and listen to music that looks, seems, or even sounds offensive	5
324	2995	Mainly because alot of people don't take being ofeneded to kindly	6
325	2995	For example, why would a person buy an object that does not seem appealing to them	7
326	2995	The second reason that I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves are because if your going to the library your looking for an interesting book, type of music, a movie, or a magazine	8
327	2995	Most likely you're going to end up getting one that looks intersting to you and something that you feel fits your taste	9
328	2995	So if there is a book, some sort of music, a movie, or a magazine and it looks offensive then don't get it because if somethings going to offend you its going to be pretty obvious due to what it looks like, seems like, or even sounds like	10
329	2995	In my opinion I think that if certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive to some people that they should not be taken off the shelf	11
330	2995	If you picked something out at the library or went to the library looking for something that you would enjoy, you will obviously end up knowing if something looks, seems, or even sounds offensive	12
331	2997	I think that all the bad books should be taken out of a library	0
332	2997	All the bad books, music, magazines and movies no one really wants to read	1
333	2997	If a kid picks up the book and reads it, and there are bad content in the books, magazines, music and movies that would be bad to read	2
334	2997	If they are young enough and they don't know if the movies or anything else in the library are bad, then it's the library's fault for letting them get the book movies, music or magazines	3
335	2997	If the parent doesn't know that their kid read the book their parents will be wondering where they got bad phrases from	4
336	2997	There are people that think that any libraries should have any bad books	5
337	2997	There are many things in books that parents don't want their children to read	6
338	2997	There are things like books that talk about sex	7
339	2997	There can also be language that the kids should not read	8
340	2997	I know for sure, that I don't want my kids to read anything bad when they grow older	9
341	2997	There are also music that parents don't want kids to listen to	10
342	2997	There is things like sex songs	11
343	2997	There are also things that don't say sex directly, but imply it	12
344	2997	I never want my kids to listen to bad songs like that, I want them to be responsible and not listen to terrible songs	13
345	2997	There is also movies that I don't want my kids to watch, because of the content of the movie	14
346	2997	There are so many things in this world that contain bad things, which all have something to do with sex	15
347	2997	Latly all the movies that came out are very inapropriate	16
348	2997	Their is one more thing that I think is very important, which is magazines	17
349	2997	There are many things that can happen in magazines like porn	18
350	2997	I hate when kids are tempted or forced to look at porn	19
351	2997	I think in general we should get rid of porn, and descusting pictures in magazines.	20
352	2999	I think that books, magazines, papers etc shouldn't be removed from the librarys because some @CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 them	0
353	2999	Some @CAPS1 feel that reading a book about there problem will help them get through what ever problem they are having	1
354	2999	@CAPS1 often say that they are stressed and depressed	2
355	2999	Those @CAPS1 can get the books and @CAPS2 them to help them solve there problems	3
356	2999	If the books etc are offensive then, the @CAPS1 who think they are shouldn't get them	4
357	2999	The can't control what books are in the library	5
358	2999	Some @CAPS1 have problems and some of the books can help them	6
359	2999	Alot of @CAPS1 I know dont think that alot of books are offensive	7
360	2999	Its eather they want to @CAPS2 them or they dont	8
361	2999	If @CAPS1 think that books etc are offensive they will just have to deal with it	9
362	2999	@CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 all kinds of books and some dont even like to @CAPS2	10
363	2999	For the @CAPS1 who like to @CAPS2 they can pick whatever book they want that they feel confortable with	11
364	2999	If they think that a book is offensive they go past it and find a different book to @CAPS2	12
365	2999	I suppose if you find a offensive book you could go to the teacher or someone and talk about it	13
366	2999	Im sure that they wont do anything about it	14
367	2999	The books and other things are there for a reason, 'For @CAPS1 To @CAPS2', and to understand what there life is and how to fix it	15
368	2999	You have to control under the books	16
369	2999	You can't tell them what books should be one the shelf and what cant be on the shelf	17
370	2999	In conclusion I think that @CAPS1 should deal with it because they cant control it	18
371	3000	Hello, my name is @CAPS1, I feel that there should be any genre of media in libraries	0
372	3000	If they call it a 'media center,' then why censor any media	1
373	3000	People know to read the back of a book to see if they want it, so if they see something they don't like they are able to put it back on the shelf	2
374	3000	People say The @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 inspired @CAPS4 @PERSON2 to kill @PERSON1, that is completly speculated it's all a matter of 'he said she said.'  I feel there should be sections for different sections for different age groups, but to censor literature is just un-@CAPS5	3
375	3000	There should be a parent supervising children @NUM1 and younger, because where it really comes to are the children and them not being exposed to something there not ready for	4
376	3000	There are some magazines and movies I feel shouldn't be in librarys, and those are as follows: pornography, non-educational movies, @CAPS6 @CAPS7, and social networks	5
377	3000	I'm not saying to let kids listen to murderous music and jump off of the terrace but, shouldn't some leeway on books	6
378	3000	This is an approved message thank you for your time, goodbye.	7
379	3001	Books Removed From Shelves	0
380	3001	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the chelf	1
381	3001	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that I work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	2
382	3001	And then we have no nooks left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 statement was from @PERSON1	3
383	3001	Do you think it is right for young children to look at immages that are not appropiate or read something that is talking baout sexual content	4
384	3001	I do not think any of these materials should be removed from the shelves, but they should be put in a privite area where only adults can get to them	5
385	3001	I think they should be put in a certain area, away from children, because children will get ideas from the material that they see and think it is okay to act like that	6
386	3001	There are some books and movies out there that teenagers and young children see that are about cereal killers and children think it is okay to bring guns to school and it is not okay	7
387	3001	Children are reading these books and thinking it is okay to act like their favorite character or acting like their favorite movie star in a movie	8
388	3001	Some of the movies that are out there are about doing stupid stuff, and children and teenagers think it is 'cool' because the person that they look up to is doing that, so they want to try it out also	9
389	3001	Children get hurt from doing @CAPS1	10
390	3001	Whenever a child sees people having sex, they think it is okay to do it too, becasue those kids in the movies are the same age as they are	11
391	3001	I think that movie producers shoudl be aware of what they put out there for children to watch	12
392	3001	When you talk about the book @CAPS2 @CAPS3, you think what a great book	13
393	3001	But would you ever think that it would be taken off of shelves because of one word that was used in it	14
394	3001	I think that it should stay on the shelves, but if a parent does not want their child to read it, then they do not have to read it	15
395	3001	If parents do not want their child to read something then just tell the teacher or child that they cannot read the book	16
396	3001	I think the books should stay on the shelves and any material that has any 'bad' sontent on it should be put in a private section where only adults can get to it	17
397	3001	Do you want your children looking at bad pictures or seeing or reading about something with sexual content	18
398	3001	Children are getting bad ideas from books, movies, magazines, and music	19
399	3001	They think it is appropiate to act like @CAPS1, because their favotire movie star is preforming @CAPS1 way	20
400	3001	These books, movies, and magazines need to be put up out of children's reach, so they cannot get anymore bad ideas to do stupid stuff	21
401	3002	I think almost every movie might offend someone in some way, So if your wanting to take every movie off the shelf then go ahead	0
402	3002	Everyone has different taste in movies, music, books, etc	1
403	3002	If the music offends you, don't listen to @CAPS2	2
404	3002	If a book does, don't read @CAPS2	3
405	3002	Its as simple as that	4
406	3002	So I don't think they should remove the books, music, movies, etc	5
407	3002	That could offend someone, and here are my reason why	6
408	3002	If you were to remove all the things that might interest the people now a-day, then you wouldn't have anything that entertains the kids instead of them going out and getting in trouble, I believe every person has the right to read, watch, or listen to whatever @CAPS2 is they want to listen to	7
409	3002	Also If they find @CAPS2 offensive then they just shouldn't listen that song, watch that movie, or even read the book or magazines	8
410	3002	Everyones offended in different ways from another, So we can't help @CAPS2 if @CAPS3 little book, song, etc., offends a person	9
411	3002	I also think if you give a kid the chance to read @CAPS2, and he sees how offensive @CAPS2 might be, @CAPS2 might keep him/her from doing some of the things he might do if he didn't read the book, Also if he watches what movies he wants, he will learn that, @CAPS1 every body is good people	10
412	3002	Children read in a wide variety, some read there dr.suess books and other could be reading @PERSON1 '@CAPS2'	11
413	3002	Depending on the children they should be able to choose what they read, listen to or watch	12
414	3002	The only flaw I find about Children down side to some magazines is the fact almost every magazine has atleast @CAPS3 half naked women, or man in @CAPS2	13
415	3002	Children in there @ORGANIZATION1 years through about first year of @ORGANIZATION2 should @CAPS1 have to see that	14
416	3002	My @CAPS4 reason is, people have many different tastes in the materials, so I believe they can read what they want as long as @CAPS2 does @CAPS1 offend them	15
417	3002	What there reading should @CAPS1 have any effect on others unless they are reading @CAPS2 also	16
418	3002	There are so many people that get offended by the littlest things, but they don't see that its life they will get offended more than a hand full of times in there life	17
419	3002	In conflusion I think that people should be able to read what they want even the books people find offensive	18
420	3002	The offensive things Should @CAPS1 be taken off the shelves	19
421	3002	I also feel that if children get to read some things that could be offensive then they will understand the fact that life isn't easy and you will end up being offended	20
422	3002	Also that @CAPS1 everyone is good people, and things happen that people don't like but its life	21
423	3002	Finally I think people should @CAPS1 have to give up reading, listening to, watching or looking at things that @MONTH1 be interesting to them	22
424	3003	The world in full of offensive material, and there almost nothing we can do for it	0
425	3003	These books that we leave behind influence the future of our society	1
426	3003	These materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries because it is part of a large varity knowledge and the library is not the last place someone will look for such material	2
427	3003	On the logical side of this, the more a person knows the more power one has	3
428	3003	That doesn't mean that some items such as centain types of music of movies are inapropate his or her age	4
429	3003	Some partents get really  offensive when they see something slightly inapropate but the thing to remember is that, those so called little children will sooner or later see such items	5
430	3003	it is just a part of growing up	6
431	3003	In the last paragraph, it suggested that a person should have large mass of imformation to choose from becasue there is not a perfect little soul and everyone has amounts of cruiosity	7
432	3003	For example somethings like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are taught in school and could be consided dangerous	8
433	3003	In @ORGANIZATION1 we learn the ways of atoms and  make make perdictions of how they will react with other chemicals	9
434	3003	When in the lab, students are required to wear safety material because of the dangerous enviroment	10
435	3003	The same goes for @CAPS1, one learns about how to live a healthy life and this requires students to learn about the human body such as the reproductive systems	11
436	3003	In these @CAPS3 we learn better how the world works around us and with this we learn things that can be dangerous	12
437	3003	With everything that we do there is postive and negative outcomes	13
438	3003	What I am suggesting is that, we need to find a healthy balance of what is really needed and the materials that are strickly entertainment, and those items should be removed	14
439	3003	If it has some purpose behind it, then it holds a place but if it is some magazine talking about drama it apears very useless	15
440	3003	In this large world there alway was and always will be people or material that are a bad influnce	16
441	3003	Yet this is all a matter of perception and everyone has different torances and values	17
442	3003	With this on going problem, we shall make this judgment with the best of our ablities, based off of our values	18
443	3004	People are entitile to their own oppinion about things	0
444	3004	What someone might find offensive someone else might not	1
445	3004	Libraries should be able to put anything that might interest a person who educate someone on there shelves wether people get offended or not	2
446	3004	If we went by what everyone said we probably wouldnt have anything on the library shelves	3
447	3004	People will find something wrong with everything a person can put out thats just human nature	4
448	3004	I have read nonfiction books and saw movies that are based on true storys that have used word and language that some people might find offensivc but how are people going to express their feelings and educate people without offending someone	5
449	3004	How are we suppose to teach history without telling the whole story	6
450	3004	Slavery and the @PERSON1 were a horrible things that happened and teaching about it is important so that it does not happen again	7
451	3004	It would be hard to teach about these horrible events without offending people	8
452	3004	I believe that we should put these materials on out library shelves anyway, and if people do not like it then do not check them out or look at them	9
453	3004	That's my opinion what's yours	10
454	3006	A book is more than words or happenings	0
455	3006	they're adventures and stories that travel from one person to another	1
456	3006	I find it amazing how someone from one country could write a book, then someone from another country could read it	2
457	3006	Inspiring stories reach from one person to another in books, music, and movies	3
458	3006	I believe things like that help shape us into who we are today	4
459	3006	There are many problems with entertainment today in my oppinion	5
460	3006	They include things now that show a lot of violence and intimacy	6
461	3006	which @MONTH1 not be fit for some people	7
462	3006	I don't think they should take them off the shelves, but simply rate them so everyone knows what to expect	8
463	3006	Movies are rated because some people don't want or need to see what will happen in them	9
464	3006	While some of it is not appropriate, other parts of it guide us	10
465	3006	It's almost like they are preparing us for the worst, but are hoping for the best	11
466	3006	We see what happens to one person in these articles of entertainment, and it helps us to make sure we don't make the same mistake	12
467	3006	I also believe that many stories and movies inspire us to be better people and to reach for our dreams	13
468	3006	If we see that one person can do it, we think, why can't I	14
469	3006	Where would we be in the world if no one encouraged or pushed someone else to do what they wanted	15
470	3006	Entertainment pushes that concept, but adds everything in it to show the reality of it	16
471	3006	Whether these things have offense or harsh contents to them, they still prepare and help us to battle through everyday life.	17
472	3007	I don't believe that certain books, music, magzines, or movies should be removed	0
473	3007	If they are found offensive then that is not my problem	1
474	3007	If they offend me then oh well that is my issue to deal with	2
475	3007	When it comes to any of the mentioned items, sooner or later society will find them again and they will be back on the shelves	3
476	3007	No matter how offensive they are curiosity will bring them back on the shelves	4
477	3007	If a book id found offensive by one person or group of people that doesnt mean it should be removed off of the shelves	5
478	3007	That is a problem that the one person or group of people will have to live with	6
479	3007	Anything and everything is educational in it's own way	7
480	3007	Even if it is offensive it can teach someone wrong from right	8
481	3007	That being said is it wrong or right for someone to want something offensive to removed from the shelves	9
482	3007	It depends on a persons personal views or beliefs	10
483	3007	Whether they like it or not things are offensive to somebody out there and there is nothing we can do out there to change that	11
484	3007	It's sad to admit, but there really isn't anything to change that	12
485	3007	It's just easier to live with it	13
486	3007	Maybe whatever you found offensive wasn't meant to be offensive	14
487	3007	It depends on what you take offence to	15
488	3007	Maybe the writer, director, or composer meant for something to be offensive, maybe they didn't	16
489	3007	It's all based on how you take what they said into thought	17
490	3007	So when it boils down to it nothing should be removed from the shelves	18
491	3007	For if one thing must be removed then youi might as well remove everything.	19
492	3008	I absolutely do not think that any book, movie, magazine, music, etc., should be removed from the shelf because they find it offensive	0
493	3008	If we do that, then all the books would be off the shelf	1
494	3008	Sometimes the really good books are when they are offensive, because they are actually telling you what they really believe in	2
495	3008	I remember when I was twelve, the news was saying that a school was taking books off the shelf because it offended one person in the school	3
496	3008	The shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book	4
497	3008	Even teachers were reading it	5
498	3008	The school board did not even care though	6
499	3008	I think that was completely handled the wrong way	7
500	3008	They should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody reads it	8
501	3008	If it offended her, then she should not read it	9
502	3008	Music is an outlet for many people	10
503	3008	They can express their feelings in a way that is amazing	11
504	3008	Without music, there would not be any fun in the world	12
505	3008	People are alwasy listening to music	13
506	3008	When they are sad, mad, upset, confused, etc	14
507	3008	If people think some kind of music is offensive, then they should not listen to it	15
508	3008	Movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time	16
509	3008	That is what makes a movie: a hero and a vilian	17
510	3008	We want to good guys to win	18
511	3008	The movie makes fun of the bad guys	19
512	3008	Somebody is always going to get hurt	20
513	3008	When I read, watch, or listen to something, I do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else	21
514	3008	I think of how the artist feels	22
515	3008	Why they wrote it that certain way	23
516	3008	If I am listening to music, I listen to the beat and the words at first	24
517	3008	Then if I like it, I start singing it	25
518	3008	If I do not like it, then I just change the song	26
519	3008	I hope people do not end up just taking things off the shelf when someone is offended	27
520	3008	We need the different opinions in life	28
521	3008	If we all had the same opinions, we would not be ourselves in anyway	29
522	3008	I do not want to be the same as everybody else	30
523	3008	I love my personality	31
524	3008	I am different and kind of an outcast	32
525	3008	But I am true to myself	33
526	3008	And I respect other people's opinions	34
527	3008	I wish everyone would do the same	35
528	3008	Or at least try to do the same	36
529	3008	Thank you for listening to what I had to say	37
530	3009	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc	0
531	3009	should not be removed from certain library shelves because people have enough sense on what they are interested in and what they are not interested in	1
532	3009	There will always be people that find specific thoughts or ideas offensive no matter what the subject is, so censorship does not really make a difference to the individual	2
533	3009	Censorship is not necessary because people know what they are interested in without anyone helping them find what they are looking for	3
534	3009	Censorship is not entirely necessary because people will always find something that they are not exactly looking for or interested in	4
535	3009	People's interests are their own business without the censorship of others in the surrounding community	5
536	3009	I've read a couple books that have cussing in them, but the book is still as good as it would be without the cussing in it	6
537	3009	People like things no matter what, because there will always be flaws with some objects such as books, music, and movies	7
538	3009	Books, music, and movies all have much interest from the common person, and each individual is capable of making their own decisions based on what they are interested in	8
539	3009	The individual does not need edited objects, or music to listen to the music or other objects without being offended	9
540	3009	There is something offensive to people in every work that has been published, and the buyer is fully aware of that fact before they go and buy something	10
541	3009	Censorship is not necessary because individuals are aware of what they are interested without anything telling them what to look for	11
542	3009	People will almost always get offended about what they are watching or listening to no matter what it is, so why is censorship such a big deal	12
543	3009	Censorship is not needed in today's society because each specific individual is capable of making their own decision in what's best for themselves	13
544	3009	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc	14
545	3009	should not be taken away from the library shelves because there will always be some offensive objects that some individuals will find offensive no matter what the object is.	15
546	3011	Would you want your childern reaing about things that only @CAPS1 know's what	0
547	3011	When you go to a library you aspect to learn about @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @LOCATION1's @CAPS4,@CAPS5 etc	1
548	3011	Libraries are for learning new things about the world that will later help you in @CAPS9	2
549	3011	When you first walk into a library you except to see people checking out @CAPS2 books , or books that catch your eye just by the title	3
550	3011	If we find a book is offensive , or will not help better our childerns' future then stand up and fight for their own  mental development	4
551	3011	We must also think of what the childern want to read	5
552	3011	They have the right to read what ever they want, as long as it's entertaining to them and they are learning something new	6
553	3011	Some books teaches them about the world they are growing up in	7
554	3011	There are some books that I would not let my own child read, but I know in my heart that she is learning something that I @MONTH1 not be able to teach her	8
555	3011	Those types of books of are what I call, '@CAPS7's'	9
556	3011	Those books that can come off seeming offensive, when in the end they are actually, what I call '@CAPS8', helping to prepare them for what is it come	10
557	3011	Not every book will be full of rainbows, pretty colors, or pop-ups	11
558	3011	They must know that they are some people they have to be mindfull of, and people who are educating them on @CAPS9	12
559	3011	They have to learn the difference between what's right, and what's wrong	13
560	3011	Remember the first book you ever read by yourself	14
561	3011	I do	15
562	3011	It was called 'Of @CAPS10 and @CAPS11'	16
563	3011	I read that book when I was @NUM1	17
564	3011	Till this day my mother says, 'I tried to stop you from reading that book so many times , it had dangerous wording that an @NUM1 year should no be able to read at that young age'	18
565	3011	What she did not know was that	19
566	3011	that book had taught me alot about the world back then	20
567	3011	That knowledge I had obtain then had helped me later on my @CAPS9	21
568	3011	Some books are ment to be read while some aren't	22
569	3011	If you feel your child should not read a certain book then read it for yourself, and then tell your child the reason why they can not read the same book you had just read.	23
570	3012	Libraries have alot of material to read about	0
571	3012	They have childrens books to adult books	1
572	3012	All of the books vary on different age groups	2
573	3012	So many people go to the libary a day	3
574	3012	But the question is, should certin materials be taken off the shelfts because they are found offensive	4
575	3012	The answer is no	5
576	3012	When people go to the libary, that means they want to learn something, or find something to intertain them	6
577	3012	When you go to the libary to reserch something, and they do not have the book you need, or the movie you need, what are you going to do	7
578	3012	What happends when you are doing a project over something, and they do not have the book you need	8
579	3012	Do you want your children failing in school because they libaries take materials off the shelfs	9
580	3012	People should not take materials off the shelfs beucase 'they do not like it.' If they think it is offensive, then they should put it back on the shelf and go find something else	10
581	3012	They do not have to take it off the shelf because they are agenst it	11
582	3012	Everyone has different beleafs on things	12
583	3012	Libaries have different sections to go find materials at	13
584	3012	It varies from kids, fiction, and nonfiction	14
585	3012	It also sometimes goes by what you are looking for	15
586	3012	No one should take something off the shelf if it is offensive because it was their choose to look at it in the first place	16
587	3012	No one can tell you what you can and cant look at when you go to a libary	17
588	3012	If they do not like what they see, then put it down	18
589	3012	It is that easy	19
590	3012	If you can not find what you are looking for, then libaries also have computers to look up things	20
591	3013	A book represents a person's beliefs and feelngs about a topic	0
592	3013	Therefore censoring books is wrong because it goes against freedom of speech	1
593	3013	I do not believe books, or other media should be removed because while it @MONTH1 be offensive, if it is the truth about something then we need to read about it to prevent tragedies from happening again	2
594	3013	A person who finds a topic offensive isn't forced to read about it	3
595	3013	If we do not accept other people beliefs, we are just as prejudice as the books we are trying to censor	4
596	3013	Many books that are threatened by censorship are books about historical facts, such as the holocaust	5
597	3013	I think we have the right to know about important events	6
598	3013	For one reason, if we forget about such things, than they are more likely to be repeated	7
599	3013	Do we really want the murder of millions of people to be repeated	8
600	3013	Just becaused we are ashamed of something dosen't mean we should sweep it under the carpet where it can lay hidden waiting to stike again like a hungry alligator	9
601	3013	Instead books about prejudice events should be kept out to show an example of how we shouldn't act	10
602	3013	While some books are censored because of shame, some are censored because a certain group of people @MONTH1 find it offensive	11
603	3013	There is a much easier solution that censoring those books	12
604	3013	The offended groups should just ignore the book	13
605	3013	If it is offensive in the first place then no one should be forced to read it	14
606	3013	The book shouldn't be forced in any other way like posters, and television broadcast	15
607	3013	It should be kept in a certain section of a library so parties wishing to avoid it can	16
608	3013	The main reason for a book to be censored in the first place is because someone finds in offensive	17
609	3013	However, isn't keeping someone from saying something just as offensive	18
610	3013	To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a big target for censorship, but it is about treating everyone fairly	19
611	3013	If that book like that was censored, it would be like saying some people are better than others	20
612	3013	Another big target for censorship in some countries is the @CAPS3	21
613	3013	Censoring that book would basically tell the @CAPS4 population that they are wrong	22
614	3013	Censoring something is wrong	23
615	3013	Not only could it cause sad events to repeat themselves, offended parties can just simply avoid the book	24
616	3013	While some books offend people, censoring a book can be just as offensive to other parties	25
617	3013	The simplest thing to do is to leave it up to the reader to decid if they should read it, or not.	26
618	3014	There are many types of materials in the library to entertain you	0
619	3014	Some of these materials @MONTH1 be books, magazines, movies, and music	1
620	3014	Each person has their own type of information and genres that they like	2
621	3014	For example, most teenage girls love to read young romance stories, and about young peoples' lives	3
622	3014	@CAPS1 people like informational books	4
623	3014	Everyone is different in their own way	5
624	3014	The material they choose to read is their own choice	6
625	3014	How would you feel if one of your favorite books or magazine were taken off the shelves of all the libraries	7
626	3014	You would probably wonder why such a thing would happen	8
627	3014	Well, some people would like to argue about how some of the information that is contained in such materials are offensive or innapropriate	9
628	3014	They want these types of things to be taken off the shelves	10
629	3014	But is it their decision to say that some things offend people	11
630	3014	Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own choice on what they want to read or what they do not want to read	12
631	3014	In my opinion, these types of materials should stay on the shelves	13
632	3014	It is simple, if you do not like a certain genre of magazines or books, do not read them	14
633	3014	If you hear someones music, and it sounds completely awful to you, then just walk away or listen to your own music	15
634	3014	Theres a new movie out about how the world is going to end, and you disbelieve in the fact that the world will not end that way, do not go and see it	16
635	3014	Some parents do not want their children to know about some of the things that are out there in the world, which is completely understandable	17
636	3014	But, everyone has rights to what they want to know and what they do not want to know	18
637	3014	If everyone had a right to take away some books that they think are not appropriate, do you think there would be any books left	19
638	3014	The thing is, is that in today's society, people want to do what they want and think what they want	20
639	3014	Some people do not agree with most things, but that is something they will have to face, because not everyone can be happy	21
640	3015	Should certain materials be removed from the shelves of the library that are found offensive	0
641	3015	@PERSON1 states that we will have no books left of the shelf to read if everyone removes a book they do not approve of	1
642	3015	What some people think is the most innocent book, could offend another individual	2
643	3015	Different people find different topics offensive	3
644	3015	No two people think the same	4
645	3015	Though certain books or magazines @MONTH1 have offensive subjects or materials in them, if they were to be removed, how would we learn	5
646	3015	For example, say there was a historical fiction book about racism	6
647	3015	The book might show different perspectives of how people lived when racism flourished	7
648	3015	Readers could learn from the books how racism affects people, and why it is wrong	8
649	3015	Learning about dislikes can make someone more knowledgable on why some people think the way they do	9
650	3015	The readers can learn from mistakes made in the past	10
651	3015	Books or movies depict how life was years or even centuries ago	11
652	3015	morals were different a while ago from what they are now	12
653	3015	If many people were to agree that a certain material is very offensive or not appropriate for adolescents or young children, one option that could be available is only allowing adults to check it out	13
654	3015	The library could also put a warning on it if they think the content of the material is too harsh	14
655	3015	Another idea could be setting up reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library	15
656	3015	Consumers can read the review first and then decide whether to check it out or not	16
657	3015	People have their own opinions and views on materials	17
658	3015	A person should learn to be tolerant of materials	18
659	3015	others might truely enjoy it	19
660	3015	This article might be offensive to those who read it, because they might think things should be more sensored rather than tolerated	20
661	3015	If someone does not like the material, they are not forced to check it out of the library so why cause a fuss over it	21
662	3015	One person might find a topic very offensive while that same topic sparks interest in another individual	22
663	3015	Each person has different morals so who is to say what should and should not be in a library?	23
664	3016	One essential right that every man, woman, or child should have is the freedom of speech	0
665	3016	Without this right no one would be able to express their views	1
666	3016	When libraries pull books, magazines, movies, and music off of their shelves it takes away that right	2
667	3016	Even if the matter of the subject is offensive to some people, the books or other items should be left on the shelves	3
668	3016	What one person finds offensive another could find miraculous	4
669	3016	If one person does not find the content of a book attractive then simply do not read the book	5
670	3016	Libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it	6
671	3016	I do think however, that books should be placed in the secton that they belong	7
672	3016	Sections for childrens books, young adult books, adult books, and many more can all be found in a library	8
673	3016	An example would be that a book about the anatomy of the human body does not belong in the childrens section	9
674	3016	beyond this, the library should leave the rest of the decisons to the reader	10
675	3016	If someone wanted to read a book on the @LOCATION1, then that person should be able to go to a library and check the book out	11
676	3016	The problem with censorship is that a @CAPS1 could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves	12
677	3016	Then the person interested in the @LOCATION1 would not be able to withdrawl the book	13
678	3016	The choice of what material you read should be left up to you, not restricted by what someone else finds offensive	14
679	3016	Libraries should not remove items from their shelves if someone else finds it offensive to their own beliefs	15
680	3016	The person should just not read the book	16
681	3016	Everyone is going to have a different opinion on most things and therefore, there should not be censorship in libraries	17
682	3017	Writing is a way to express one's thoughts and ideas on a page	0
683	3017	In this country, an author can write freely about whatever he desires and he is not subject to penalty for doing so	1
684	3017	Sometimes reading these works can be enjoyable, other times it can be rather disturbing	2
685	3017	However, just because a work is offensive does not mean that it is not worth reading	3
686	3017	Books, manuscripts, and other forms of literature should not be taken off the shelves even if they are disturbing or offensive	4
687	3017	The @CAPS1, a book written by @PERSON2, revealed the horrible practices of the meat packing industry	5
688	3017	It was offensive to many, and in addition it caused an uprising among @CAPS2 because of its content	6
689	3017	However, there is a reason that book is still talked about today	7
690	3017	If there had been laws prohibiting him from writing about the horrific things that were taking place in those factories, it is quite possible and actually very likely that the industry wouldn't have been reformed for a long time	8
691	3017	Fortunately, @PERSON2 exposed the horrific processes that took place in the industry and the government stepped in and solved the problem	9
692	3017	Someone out there hates this book, and hated it from the day it was published	10
693	3017	But that doesn't mean he has the right to remove it from the shelves and prevent all others from reading it	11
694	3017	Too often students are forced to read works of fiction and stories that, although they are beneficial for students, do not inform students about the world in which they find themselves	12
695	3017	It is important for a student to read @ORGANIZATION1, and the works @PERSON4 and @LOCATION1	13
696	3017	However, students must learn and begin to understand the world in which they currently find themselves, the eras of the past, and the circumstances that they will find themselves in for decades to come	14
697	3017	They must learn how to become successful in life	15
698	3017	They should read works by @PERSON1, such as @CAPS3, which essentially tells the story of success and what seperates the average from the great	16
699	3017	Someone out there hates these works, and he should not have the right to ruin the opportunity that these books and short stories could give someone else	17
700	3017	Reading is the best way to learn	18
701	3017	In a world of social networking and 'screens' of all types, the importance of reading has been diminished	19
702	3017	Students must develop a love of reading, and if everyone who hates a book takes it off the shelves, then, as Paterson said, 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' No book should ever be taken off the shelves	20
703	3017	Never	21
704	3018	Dear Newspaper,      I beleive that no book should be taken off the selfs for nay reason	0
705	3018	People @MONTH1 not be mature enough for some books, music, magazines, etc., and so the libraries that have a problem with some of the materials then maybe they should put a limit to age on checking out certain things	1
706	3018	Libraires keep all types of books and magazines so what would be their reason to take the material off the self	2
707	3018	I think that there are different types of people in the world and everyones going to wnat to read something different	3
708	3018	If libraries are going to take the material off the self that people don't like then the material that others like would be gone	4
709	3018	For instance,if i were to take the '@CAPS1' series off the selves then all the '@CAPS1' fans would be ferious and upset	5
710	3018	But knowing that lots of people like the series, my library isn't going to do that	6
711	3018	There is alot of books that parents don't want their children to read, but libraries arn't going to take them off the selfs	7
712	3018	Some parents arn't going to want their children and teenagers to read a romantic, rasy book but thats what other adults enjoy reading	8
713	3018	Those books arn't going to go away but if parents have problems with it then maybe they should mention to the library to put an age limit to them	9
714	3018	The parents could also check on what their child or teenager is reading	10
715	3018	But those books will be in libraries forever and you can't make them go away because you don't want you're chilren to read them	11
716	3018	From experiance, I've read a couple racy books and they are disturbing for me, being an imatture addiunce	12
717	3018	But i'm not going to ask for the books to be taken off the self	13
718	3018	Some books are very vulger and nasty in the ways they discribe fights or wars or abuse but some people like readinf lititure like that so the libraries will keep them	14
719	3018	If peoplehave problems with books then stay away from them and don't read them	15
720	3018	Its as simple as that	16
721	3018	In conclusion, I think all books should stay on the shelves because all people have different interest and opinions	17
722	3018	If anyone has a problem with a book for being racy or vulgur then they shouldn't ready that book, and if they dont want their childrena and teenagers to read the book either then they should be a parent and not let them	18
723	3018	They can't blame the library for books they don't want their kids to read because thats not fair to the people who enjoy those books and like to read them	19
724	3018	Sincerly, @PERSON1	20
725	3019	From many thoughts and arguments people disagree with the school libraries	0
726	3019	The main reason is because of the books, magazines, ariticles, and internet that contains content very disturbing for children	1
727	3019	Such content requires material as violence, drugs, and nudity	2
728	3019	In this argument, parents do not like the fact that their kids have resources to uncensored content	3
729	3019	Or perhaps the parents do not care about what their children have access to	4
730	3019	Today libraries are not focused on the materials that they have on their shelves	5
731	3019	That is how children could get the idea in being a 'bad kid' in school	6
732	3019	They think it is cool seeing someone else doing drugs, violence, or nudity	7
733	3019	But if the libraries have censored content in the library, then kids would not enjoy it if they would have uncensored content	8
734	3019	In the parents thoughts, uncensored content should be kept away from children	9
735	3019	The libraries should be more responsible with the content that they have on their shelves	10
736	3019	They either do or do not know that they have offensive content in their library	11
737	3019	They need to remove all offensive and uncensored content from their shelves for the children	12
738	3019	It is not right for the kids to see any offensive or uncensored material	13
739	3019	Their are parents who have kids in school, who do not care about what they learn or what they do	14
740	3019	Parents should be more concerned about what their kids are learning everyday	15
741	3019	Then they can at least teach their childern about uncensored content	16
742	3019	Parents and libraries should be more responsible about the offensive content that the children could possibly have access to	17
743	3019	Children should not see any of the content because it is not right for a child	18
744	3019	The falt goes to the parents and the libraries	19
745	3019	They should be aware of the material that the children are looking at	20
746	3020	Do you want your nine year old @CAPS2 talking and reading about inappropreite subjects such as sexual relationships or language	0
747	3020	No	1
748	3020	I know I wouldn't for my @CAPS2	2
749	3020	I think books that are offensive and inappropreite shouldn't be in @LOCATION1 school or elementray schools with little ones or even @NUM1 years olds	3
750	3020	And parents should be in conrol of what thier kids watch and listen too	4
751	3020	Honstley we can't control how people make movies or what singers are saying in songs but we can control who listens to them and watches them	5
752	3020	Its the parents that are the only ones who can control thier children, no one else	6
753	3020	In libraries I feel like its the librarians who are the cause for letting children read offensive books	7
754	3020	And I don't mean any disrespect but wouldn't you agree	8
755	3020	I mean think about it, librarians are the ones in control of the books that are in the library, and I think that they should make sure that the book young teens are checking out are appropraite enough for them to read	9
756	3020	Ones that don't involve sex or violence that @NUM1 year olds shouldn't be reading	10
757	3020	Here's an idea, maybe libraries should have @DATE1 year olds sign a paper or have a certain card with them that allows them to check out that certain book or @CAPS4	11
758	3020	And it should have parents permisson on it showing that the parents approve of this	12
759	3020	But I think high schoolers should only be aloud to do this because they are more mature than younger ones	13
760	3020	They know better than to start fights or cuss in school	14
761	3020	All I'm saying is that I DO agree with this problem, parents are the reason thier kids are immature and rude because they @CAPS1 thier children get away with the attitude and rudeness	15
762	3020	So yes parents and other people do have the right to sensor movies and book, etc	16
763	3020	But what about @CAPS4 theaters you ask	17
764	3020	DONT @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 TO THE @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 YOU!!	18
765	3020	It's that simple	19
766	3020	Students in high school @CAPS3 to the @CAPS5 after school with friends and get in to see rated @CAPS7 movies @CAPS6 parents	20
767	3020	And I do believe that some of them use fake @CAPS8 so they don't need a parent with them	21
768	3020	Teens will @CAPS3 home that night and want to re-enact what they saw in the @CAPS4	22
769	3020	Even if it's sex, or fights or even language	23
770	3020	It's really sad that parents allow this to happen and I think the parents should grow up and disapline thier students	24
771	3020	I've seen to many parents letting thier children get away with thier mouth and attitude	25
772	3020	Most of my friends parents @CAPS1 thier children get away with everything	26
773	3020	One of my friends is really bad at getting what she wants	27
774	3020	She told me that all she has to do is cry and she gets what she wants	28
775	3020	I don't always get what I want and I don't want every new thing out there because I don't deserve it	29
776	3020	I have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop	30
777	3020	I ask my parents and they eaither say we don't have enough money or you don't need it and I just move on with my life	31
778	3020	But I don't @CAPS1 books or movies control my life and change who I am	32
779	3020	Those things aren't that important	33
780	3020	I mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries	34
781	3020	The stories or movies, etc., that teens should really pay attention to are the edicational ones	35
782	3020	The ones that teach us about life and society	36
783	3020	About the future and teach us how life is as an adult and ready us for the real world	37
784	3020	Because once those seniors open those high school doors and graduate it's no more staying up late and sleeping in and parting on the weekends	38
785	3020	Its the real world, the adult world	39
786	3020	So please read this carefully and I hope what I have said has helped you realize why people sensor these things	40
787	3020	Why kids are acting the way they are	41
788	3020	Libraries should sensor certain things and not allow students below high school to read them	42
789	3020	Please think about what I have said and thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this	43
790	3021	In this millenium we really should'nt be to concerned about censorhip	0
791	3021	People say so way worse in puplic and do worse things in public	1
792	3021	On the other side of this, the parents of a child should be watching their kid and looking to see what they are about to grab off the shelf	2
793	3021	Its the parents fault if their child gets ahold of a book that has adult content on or in it	3
794	3021	So why should we have censorship	4
795	3021	If a cd contains adult content and the child is underage and grabs it off the shelf listening to it, then its the parents fault for not being responsible enough to watch their child	5
796	3021	Same goes for books and etc.	6
797	3021	Now if the child is old enough to understand what they grab then they should be able to listen to it, and ask questions about it	7
798	3021	If its about adult relationships and the child takes it, then the parent should explain it all and tell them what is going on	8
799	3021	The parent should be the one to take responsibility	9
800	3021	Now, if a book, music, movie, magazine, and ect.contain raceism in it then it should be censored, unless its about history	10
801	3021	Kids under the age of teen usally repeat what they hear or read	11
802	3021	Same goes for teenagers too actualy	12
803	3021	Books with the wrong kind of words in it should be kept safe or there should be a age to where you can get it	13
804	3021	The world has enough horrid language in it, why should the library add to it by letting kids get ahold of these books and repeating what they hear	14
805	3021	I remember when I was walking around a library and I saw a little kid not older than @NUM1 grab an adult book and started to open it and look through it	15
806	3021	The parent was no where to be seen nor heard, who leaves their child in a book section like that	16
807	3021	This young boy put the book down on the hard floor and started to take off his clothes	17
808	3021	This was no ones fault, wasnt the library, wasnt mine	18
809	3021	People should take responsibility, control their kids and if they can't then leave them at home	19
810	3021	There are also certain people who need book for research and need to take home books for their projects	20
811	3021	We should'nt have censorship and take down all the books that should be contained from kids	21
812	3021	Some of us need those kind of books in order for us to do our research and projects	22
813	3021	No we should'nt have censorship in our libraries	23
814	3021	Im not about to be able to miss a project or miss a good movie because some parents don't know how to control their kids and watch what they grab	24
815	3021	We should be able to keep all the books, movies, magazines, and ect., there could be a way to censor most books but they would need their own shelf, and they could be a age lemit or a pass people could use	25
816	3021	That would take to long to do so though	26
817	3021	So keep our libraries filled with interesting things without censoring them!	27
818	3022	Libraries, to myself, are a gateway to another world	0
819	3022	where I can be who I want to be, and let my imagination wander where ever it pleases	1
820	3022	Libraries should not have the ability to take a book off the shelves depending on it's content	2
821	3022	We are all different people, we all don't enjoy the same kind of books	3
822	3022	Also, some books @MONTH1 be needed for research	4
823	3022	Censorship in a library should not be allowed	5
824	3022	First, there are so many different people in the world	6
825	3022	Some people learn more about people from books	7
826	3022	Imagine yourself a white, @NUM1 year old boy, growing up in an all white town	8
827	3022	Never in your life have you seen an @CAPS1 @CAPS2	9
828	3022	You go to the library and pick up 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 young boy has never been introduced to such racism	10
829	3022	Books are history	11
830	3022	Books are learning	12
831	3022	Books can not be taken off the shelf just for their content	13
832	3022	That content might be a whole other world for a young child	14
833	3022	Next, libraries are used so often by college students to writer papers for school	15
834	3022	Books are needed for research	16
835	3022	For an example, you're a college student writing a research paper on abuse--including sexual, physical, and mental	17
836	3022	A young author writes a non-fiction novel about her childhood ranging from being raped by her father at six years old to being bullied in school	18
837	3022	After hours of searching, you find all local libraries have removed @CAPS4 book for it's explicit content	19
838	3022	College students need books no matter what they're about	20
839	3022	Libraries are open to people of all age	21
840	3022	It is understandable that a twelve year old could easily get a hold of a book inappropriate for their age level, but that's why libraries are split into sections	22
841	3022	If you find a book that is considered to be taken off the shelves, don't remove it, just move it to a more secure and mature area	23
842	3023	Book @CAPS1     @CAPS2 I think about removing certain materials such as books, music, movies, and-or magazines is that it should be your choice	0
843	3023	I always thought that was part of our constitutional right	1
844	3023	I read alot of urban books because that's @CAPS2 I enjoy	2
845	3023	They realae towhere I have been, or where I @MONTH1 be going in my life	3
846	3023	No they are not the kinds of books I would read to my grand childern, but they @MONTH1 choose later in life that they also enjoy urban books and movies	4
847	3023	You @MONTH1 not enjoy reading the materials that I enjoy either but that doesn't mean you should banned them	5
848	3023	There are alot of books, and movies that I don't care for but I wouldn't ask for them to be banned	6
849	3023	If everyone started @CAPS1 @CAPS2 they don't like, there wouldn't be any need for movies,  libraries, or book stores	7
850	3023	Kids wouldn't have a future because they wouldn't know where they came from	8
851	3023	@CAPS2's bad to you @MONTH1 not be bad to me, or the next person	9
852	3023	When you go into a library, or book store, you already have and idea of @CAPS2 you are looking for	10
853	3023	If there are books that are not appropreiate for kids, they should have their own section that reads, 'For @CAPS3 @CAPS4'	11
854	3023	We are the @CAPS3 and parents	12
855	3023	We should be the one's in control of our kids and @CAPS2 they read and watch	13
856	3023	I don't think @CAPS1 the materials would make the problem go away because kids these days, if they want them bad enough, will figure out away to read or watch them anyway	14
857	3023	Ann                                        @CAPS5 and @CAPS6	15
858	3024	Libraries are our way of knowing what has happened in the past whether it is all fact or maybe fiction	0
859	3024	No matter what type of book it is, it still tells us a story of another place and another time	1
860	3024	Libraries should not be censored	2
861	3024	Taking away one book because of one sentence that seems vulgar and inapropriate for young readers is wrong	3
862	3024	I understand that reading books with adult material such as drug abuse and sexuality can lead to experimentation but is that not life	4
863	3024	At least once in our exsistance on earth we find ourselves curious about something at we try it, just to see what it is like	5
864	3024	It is all a learning experience	6
865	3024	History would most likely be the touchiest subject in our libraries mainly because we are asshamed of what we acted like thirty plus years ago, discrimination in @LOCATION1, the @CAPS1, and now the wars in the middle east	7
866	3024	Some countries do not even teach their own history to students in school because they are embarrassed of what happened or afraid that it might happen again if the students know @CAPS6, why and what happened	8
867	3024	Reading and knowing about what our ancestors did will help us lead a better future not distroy it	9
868	3024	Today's media has overflowed with adult material not suitable for kids under @NUM1	10
869	3024	If anything we need to start censoring what we broadcast on television and also what we post on the @CAPS4 and leave our libraries alone	11
870	3024	Most of the books that are in our libraries has been there for like forty years so it is completely pointless to remove it when it has already educated young minds for over forty years	12
871	3024	I truthfully do not know why you would want to remove books or censor them with a sharpie marker	13
872	3024	All that is doing is giving readers less material to read	14
873	3024	In @LOCATION2, elementary educators are not required to teach their students @CAPS6 to spell, at all	15
874	3024	I walked into a third grade classroom and watched a girl spell @CAPS2 '@CAPS3' thinking that was the correct why to spell @CAPS2	16
875	3024	The @ORGANIZATION1's excuse for not having teachers teach @CAPS6 to spell is that they should learn that from reading books everyday	17
876	3024	Well guess what @LOCATION2, with the @CAPS4, gaming systems and iPods, little kids are not taking to reading like they did ten years ago and we are going to have a lot of future adults not know @CAPS6 to read and this is what it is going to be like	18
877	3024	'@CAPS5 @CAPS6 do you spell encyclopedia?'     '@CAPS6 should i know, I wasn't taught @CAPS6 to spell in @LOCATION2.'     You see what I mean, so if you are going to take away the ability to spell you better not take away our books becuase they are the only things teaching our @ORGANIZATION1's future on @CAPS6 to spell simple words	19
878	3024	Today we have the @CAPS4, gaming systems, iPods and @CAPS8 to intertain us on a daily basis	20
879	3024	No one is taking to reading as a way to relieve boredom, they are just sitting on the couch watching television	21
880	3024	And now if you reduce reading material for teens and young readers you are not incouraging us to read	22
881	3024	You are taking away all of the interesting parts of a book	23
882	3024	To be truthfull I will read and reread a book many times over if it is a good story with some extra sizzle	24
883	3024	I do not enjoy books that do not have drugs, alcohol, family stress, war stories or even some sexuality mainly because books without that are boring	25
884	3024	When i read books like that they make me feel better about my life and @CAPS6 I interact with others	26
885	3024	I have learned @CAPS6 to deal with all of those things from books	27
886	3024	Most of my knowledge comes from those types of books and I would hate for my children to not be able to read the same materials as I did at their age and learn from those books	28
887	3025	I belive certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should never be removed from libraries because even if offensive people still have the right to acess that information	0
888	3025	I make this opinion by the guidlines our country was built on, freedom of speech and equality for everyone	1
889	3025	If we started removing books, movies etc	2
890	3025	from out of our libraries for being offensive, where would we draw the line between offensive and not	3
891	3025	To remove even one book from a library for offending a certain race or culture, would be the beging of a tornado of books being removed by eveyone who has ever not agreed with what is said about them or about their culture and lifestyles	4
892	3025	Now, let's stop and think about what it means for somthing to be offensive in the first place	5
893	3025	People are offended by things in out world every day and books and movies in our libraries are probably pretty low down on the offensive totem pole next to say the internet or news I would think, wouldn't you?	6
894	3025	Plus, the materials we provide to our libraries with are for people too learn and teach, they arn't made to be offensive or rude and in my experience with libraries being a @NUM1+ year user I have never found anything to be offesive or hurtful to anyone.In my conclusion there are just too many books about to many subjects already written to even begin to go through which ones are offensive or not and too whom	7
895	3025	In conclusion to that libraries are a place of leaning and teaching and the information inside is ment to be helpful and constructive not offesive or hurtful and to start removing materials now would eventualy lead to the end of libraries.	8
896	3026	Have you ever been offended	0
897	3026	Did you lash out, or did you keep an open mind and come try understanding	1
898	3026	People are offended by many things every day in life	2
899	3026	So, we should broaden our minds, and see these 'offenses' as a normality	3
900	3026	You're at a party with a bowl full of candy stationed right beside the front door	4
901	3026	You walk in and take a piece	5
902	3026	Wait, you don't want that piece	6
903	3026	What are you going to do with it	7
904	3026	Do you take all of the same pieces that you don't like out of the bowl and throw them away, or do you simply drop it back into the bowl and choose a new one	8
905	3026	If you throw the candy away, what does that mean for the other party guests	9
906	3026	You have narrowed their choices down because of your own selfish opinion	10
907	3026	That candy could have been the guest favorite	11
908	3026	But, since YOU don't like it, you take away the other guests' privilege to eat that candy	12
909	3026	They didn't deserve that, now did they	13
910	3026	If you're searching through books in a library and you come across a book that doesn't interest you or offends you, then put it back and look for a new one	14
911	3026	If you're having trouble finding the right book, ask the librarian for suggestions on other topics or books to check out	15
912	3026	Go to a new library, even, but don't mess with something that isn't yours	16
913	3026	Especially, something as small as a book	17
914	3026	The point of the matter is, if you don't like something then disregard it	18
915	3026	The moment the book, and the book alone, starts causing problems is the moment anyone should intervene	19
916	3026	But, come on, do you really think a book could cause a problem	20
917	3026	If your child is having problems, don't you think you ought to check what's going on with him instead of looking to see if he/she checked out the 'book that we hope none of our children' took off the shelf	21
918	3026	This is quite possibly one of the last things I would think of causing a problem, if I even thought of this at all	22
919	3026	Opinions can cause a lot of problems	23
920	3026	Sometimes, people just need to keep their opinions to themselves, agreed?	24
921	3027	The libraries can contain book that are offensive to humans and animals	0
922	3027	The book the are very offensive can contain megative coments just to entertain the readers	1
923	3027	I believe that all book, music, magazines, and etc should be removed from the shelves if they are found to contain offensive and negative thing about any human	2
924	3027	For example, in political cartoon inside of newspapers, @PERSON1 is sometimes compared with a @CAPS1	3
925	3027	We as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 take it very offensive when they are called someone in our own race a @CAPS1	4
926	3027	I take that very offensive because, back during the time when black were not able to do certain thing, the whites would refer to blacks as monkeys	5
927	3027	I being offened is not a good thing, and they last place they need offensive stuff is in the libraries	6
928	3027	Libraries are suppose to hold positive material on the shevles	7
929	3027	Book that give knowledge to people in need, not thing contain negative depictions of human life	8
930	3027	Also children should be able to pick up a book, and not feel offened by it	9
931	3027	One night my little brother came home with a book that he got for the library	10
932	3027	It was about a white dog and a dark colored dog together trying to find food and a place to sleep	11
933	3027	But one day the dark colored dog was lefted out in the cold while a loving family toke in the white dog , into their warm home	12
934	3027	My brother feel so uncomfortable with that book, he decided to take it back that same night	13
935	3027	Libraries can contain very offensive things that can make a person sick to their stomachs	14
936	3027	Offensive thing can hurt a persons feelings, and libraries should be the last place where a person should feel uncomfortable reading a book	15
937	3027	Eventhough my brother found a book that he disliked, he still continues to go to the library to find excellent books to read	16
938	3027	Libraries are fun to go to, but they can contain very offensive thing that can hurt a person's feelings.	17
939	3028	Censorship is found on television, in libraries, in schools, and even in homes	0
940	3028	Do you think that censorship should be used	1
941	3028	Censorship can be used to block one's personal thoughts and opinions to promote conformism	2
942	3028	I disagree with the idea of Censorship	3
943	3028	Not everyone thinks people should be able to have their own images and visions	4
944	3028	however, that is what makes our world so individualized	5
945	3028	Censorship in libraries is growing more and more gradually	6
946	3028	The government does not want the society, especially the youth, of @LOCATION1 to read things that are deemed inappropriate	7
947	3028	Should that not be up to one's guardian, or if they are old enough, to oneself	8
948	3028	When you read books, you see language being block out, they take parts out to make the book seem more classy, also they block out things such as drugs and alcohol	9
949	3028	A lot of people believe that books are what hurt a lot of today's society	10
950	3028	I believe that reading material could be a lot more educational if the editors woud leave some of the things that they censor, in the book	11
951	3028	I believe this because, if parents decide to not let their child read a story that is up to them	12
952	3028	however, their child could learn about certain situations and possibly learn how to handle those difficult things	13
953	3028	This opinion that censorship in books could be absolutely debatable	14
954	3028	Censorship such as in the book, @ORGANIZATION1 is being used	15
955	3028	The government is taking out certain words in this story because they are seen as offensive	16
956	3028	This is understandable also	17
957	3028	I do not believe this amazing novel should be seen in this way	18
958	3028	The language was not meaning to be used offensively, but simply to state how people talked and how things were when @PERSON1 was alive	19
959	3028	If it were not for books like this, how would out society learn about not only @LOCATION1's history, but other culture's history	20
960	3028	In all fairness, @ORGANIZATION1 is an educational novel about how times were in the day of @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1	21
961	3028	Censorship in movies is also growing	22
962	3028	Television will block out things such as language, nudity, alcohol, drugs, and things of that nature	23
963	3028	I would not like to turn on the television and see these things everywhere, but it could educate people on what and what not to do	24
964	3028	I believe if censorship were not used, people's thoughts would be more apt to imagine	25
965	3028	Imagination can scare people	26
966	3028	Some think that imagination can turn someone crazy or into doing something that is not normal	27
967	3028	but what is normal	28
968	3028	It is to the community, doing what everyone else is doing and not being different, this scares people	29
969	3028	This whole essay brings me back to the thought that censorship is basically conformism	30
970	3028	The word conformism means to all become one	31
971	3028	to conform	32
972	3028	If this is the case no one will ever come up with new books, music, movies, magazines, or ideas	33
973	3028	we will all just be citizens of @LOCATION1 or any other culture trapped inside our very own minds	34
974	3030	Books, music, movies, magazines, and more are a good way to learn	0
975	3030	Some of that material is bad though, but some is good	1
976	3030	Not all people are the same, and not all books or magazines are the same	2
977	3030	Books, newspapers, and magazines are good things, and they could be bad things	3
978	3030	Some talk about nonfiction and some fiction	4
979	3030	Others talk about famous people and all the good and mainly bad things they did this week, which is something some of us want to read but none of us should read or even write in the first place	5
980	3030	Then there are books that have a childs story in them	6
981	3030	There are also articles that everyone should read about, like somebody who saved a whole lot of people on @DATE1	7
982	3030	There is a diverse amount of things to read out there, you just need to use a little discretion about what to read and put out on the shelves at a public library	8
983	3030	Music is another good way to express yourself	9
984	3030	There is good old fashioned @CAPS1 music such as @ORGANIZATION1	10
985	3030	Then there is stuff that nobody should listen to, or for that matter even sing about like almost all @CAPS2 Music	11
986	3030	They also have little childrens songs which no matter how annoying that most of it is, it's alright for anyone to listen to	12
987	3030	Or you can pick up some good ol' @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or any other christian artists or gospel music.The music of this world is very diverse	13
988	3030	The movies of today can, but most of the time aren't,be  good things	14
989	3030	You could pick up an educational video that talks about animals that most everyone could watch	15
990	3030	There are also bad movies such as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6.It is a horror movie that made it hard to fall asleep for a few days	16
991	3030	Those are some that nobody should even produce.There are video copies of television shows as well, which can be alright	17
992	3030	The vast amount of movies made today should not even be a thought in someones mind but some are good and educational	18
993	3030	So in conclusion, I think it should be reader and viewer discretion when it comes to content of things as this	19
994	3030	Libraries everywhere should have most everything there is.Next time your in a library, just use discretion	20
995	3031	Every library has tons of information on just about everything	0
996	3031	There are tons of books, music, movies, magazines and more that contain this information	1
997	3031	There is even some information that some people might take offence to	2
998	3031	On the other hand, somebody else could be perfectly fine with it	3
999	3031	I think that all libraries should keep all their books on the shelfs, no matter what kind of content they contain, because not everybody takes offence to some contents in books, and it is the same way vice versa	4
1000	3031	The subject race might come into play in some books in libraries	5
1001	3031	Books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race	6
1002	3031	Some people want books took out of their libraries because of the content that they contain, but really it could be a n important part of history that people need to be educated about	7
1003	3031	Some books have words that are very offencive to people because of their skin color, relgion, or ethnic race	8
1004	3031	This information that people need to know because thats how people were treated back then and some stuff like that still occurs today	9
1005	3031	Libraries have all kinds of information	10
1006	3031	I think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain	11
1007	3031	Even if some content is offensive some people it could still be a important part of history that people need to know	12
1008	3032	In my opinion, books, movies, magazines, ect., should not be taken off the shelves if they are offensive to some people	0
1009	3032	this is because everyone has different views on everything	1
1010	3032	Another reson is because for learning purposes in schools and etc	2
1011	3032	As well as authors would not want to be writting books because the books shelves are empty and their books, movies, magazines are getting rejected	3
1012	3032	Since most people have different veiws on everything then,   every book or magazine would be taken off the shelf if they were offensive because, therefore, there would not be any book or magazine left on the shelf	4
1013	3032	This is because people think different things are offensive so what somebody thinks is offensive it @MONTH1 not be to another person	5
1014	3032	Therefore people would be angered or upset if their favorite book was taken off the shelf because someone said it was offensive	6
1015	3032	Another problem with taking 'offensive' books of the shelf is that it would be a result in people not learning in schools and ect	7
1016	3032	This is because we all have to go through some point in school where we find something offensive for example wars, slavery, and politics	8
1017	3032	If all these books were to be taken off the shelves then nobody would be learning about any of this	9
1018	3032	In conclusion noboby would be being taught why these events happened and  why these events are wrong, so people would not have changed, they would keep doing these things because they were not taught not to	10
1019	3032	This in my opinion would cause alot of conflict between people and nobody would be educated on these events of history	11
1020	3032	On the other hand rather than books being taken off the shelf books would not be being put on the shelfs	12
1021	3032	In this I mean that authors, producers, would not be making movies or writting books because their work just keeps getting rejected	13
1022	3032	Not only rejected but nobdy is going to go through the time and effort to make one of these for it to be rejected because it was offensive	14
1023	3032	In my opinion it would almost be impossible for these authors/ directors to make a unoffensive book or movie for everyone that is going to read or watch it	15
1024	3032	In conclusion I have read many books in class every year that offends at least one person, but this person can choose not to finish the movie, book, or magazine if they find it offensive, or they never have to read it again	16
1025	3032	In conclusion there are many reasons why books should stay on the shelf even if they are offensive to someone	17
1026	3032	This is because it would not help with people being educated on events that happened, and people would not be reading any books in school	18
1027	3032	As well as authors would not be writting since their books are getting removed and the shelves are empty	19
1028	3033	Why should we be more carefull of what we get at the libary	0
1029	3033	Libaries can have books with knowledge, fun, rommance, and action or adventure, but some can be desterbing and grusium	1
1030	3033	Kids a lot of times will pick books that have pornagerfy or grusium action	2
1031	3033	This causes the kids to act in different ways	3
1032	3033	They act hyper and mean to other people or even other children	4
1033	3033	They are sneeky and do things behind the parents back	5
1034	3033	Why is because they think they need to act this way because its cool, but they don't understand this makes them look very ugly	6
1035	3033	'So take them out' is some of the parents are saying now a days	7
1036	3033	Even if we do take out all the books that can be bad for our children, there will not be a lot of books left	8
1037	3033	Because now a days all books have something that is bad for our mind	9
1038	3033	So why do we need to be more carefull with the books we put in our libary and the books we take out of our libary	10
1039	3033	It causes the world to change very fast	11
1040	3033	Now libarys are a great place for kids to learn	12
1041	3033	Books can teach them new things and expand their knowledge	13
1042	3033	The libary is where all kids that have reports or essays on important people come to	14
1043	3033	Some kids go there just to get a book to enjoy	15
1044	3033	From my point of view libary is one of my most favorites places to be	16
1045	3033	Any where there are books involved count me there	17
1046	3033	Having books causes our imagination to come out and take us on adventeres that some of us will never get to do	18
1047	3033	Sometimes books can cause things to happen in families	19
1048	3033	Some of them causes us to have nightmares or have very bad behavior	20
1049	3033	If we try to take out some of these books it will help the familes to come together, but also if we don't take out some of the books, it will cause things to go wild	21
1050	3033	Because people and kids think they need these books to survive in the world	22
1051	3033	Which really its just  the books and ect..	23
1052	3033	that causes our mind to picture things that make us think we need them	24
1053	3033	Other writing materials and even movies cause problems in this world today	25
1054	3033	Magazines can have girls with not much clothes on or other things that make boys minds wander	26
1055	3033	Movies are even worse because the picture is right there in front of their faces	27
1056	3033	I am not saying all magazines and movies are bad to our mind because they can also be helpful	28
1057	3033	Magazines can help us with research or just to now what is happening in this world today	29
1058	3033	They also can talk on many subjects like cooking, room decerating, on how to decerate your weddings and etc..	30
1059	3033	Movies can help us research and also show us what happened back then	31
1060	3033	Like watching docromentries, they are on people or what happened in our past	32
1061	3033	We don't need to take every movie or magazine out, but some we can do without	33
1062	3033	So why do we need to be more carefull for what we put in libaries	34
1063	3033	It can cause us to have bad behavior or bad dreams	35
1064	3033	So how can we help to solve this problem	36
1065	3033	We can take out  books, magazines, movies and etc..	37
1066	3033	that are really bad for our mind	38
1067	3033	So it can help our children to grow up well behavied and mature	39
1068	3033	Also one more thing books, magazines, and movies can be a very good thing if we use it right	40
1069	3033	How do we know we got a good book	41
1070	3033	We find right books for us by following our heart and our instinkes	42
1071	3034	Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
1072	3034	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
1073	3034	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 quote is reflecting people wanting to rid of some of the literature, books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries, because they think that the material is inappropriate	2
1074	3034	If we got rid of all of the books from @CAPS1 world, we would have nothing left to learn from, and some of the main sources of entertainment would vanish	3
1075	3034	I believe that certain materials should not be replaced from the shelves, because the youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should learn about how cultures really are, authors and writers need to be able to express themselves, and parents should be able to control what they believe their children should and should not read	4
1076	3034	If it were not for books and novels from the past, the current generations would have no clue of what history was about	5
1077	3034	Children should be allowed to read books such as @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in order to get a taste of how much times have changed	6
1078	3034	Stories from grandparents only take a person back about @NUM1 years	7
1079	3034	we need sources that can take us back thousands of years	8
1080	3034	Some families, such as an @CAPS6 @CAPS7 family, might get offended if their children are reading books that say things like 'nigger,' but that is our history	9
1081	3034	It is something we cannot change, and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated	10
1082	3034	We also do not want today's youth making some of the terrible mistakes generations in the past made, so they need to be taught about the real but sometimes horrendous situations	11
1083	3034	Learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted	12
1084	3034	Money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture	13
1085	3034	How is a young girl from a small town in @LOCATION2 supposed to find out how people in @LOCATION1 live their life	14
1086	3034	For all she knows, the people could be living in igloos	15
1087	3034	I believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society	16
1088	3034	Movies can teach a lot about different countries, and books do a wonderful job as well	17
1089	3034	If they are gone, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten	18
1090	3034	Also, authors and directors need to be able to express themselves	19
1091	3034	Every since people are young, they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style	20
1092	3034	Not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows	21
1093	3034	There are people that love writing about violence, gore, and segregation	22
1094	3034	Those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality	23
1095	3034	Getting rid of all of those books from library shelves will not solve the problems	24
1096	3034	it would only cause people to not expect what might happen to them or @CAPS1 world	25
1097	3034	Now, some parents @MONTH1 have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book, but parents should have control over their kids	26
1098	3034	If they have a problem with what their children are reading, then they should deal with that personally	27
1099	3034	They do not need to influence other people's lives by trying to get rid of the materials off of public libraries' shelves	28
1100	3034	Why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in @CAPS1 world is beyond me	29
1101	3034	It would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery, depressions, world wars, and homicides	30
1102	3034	It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn about the things from the past in order to not make the same mistakes and things of the current world in order to be accepting and understanding	31
1103	3034	Books, magazines, movies, and music are wonderful	32
1104	3034	They represent self-expression and freedom of speech, so people should let them be an entertainment and learning source	33
1105	3034	Without them, we would be and have nothing	34
1106	3036	Who cares about unsensored things anyway	0
1107	3036	Offensive things have been around in libraries, probably since the first library opened	1
1108	3036	There has been 'offensive' things in a library for as long as i can remember	2
1109	3036	Now everyone is suppose to share there opinons on pulling these offensive books off the shelve	3
1110	3036	What is the differnce between someone saying somthing offense or writing it	4
1111	3036	Ok, so maybe you dont want your child reading somthing unsensored, but the chances are some other child will say somthing unsensored around him	5
1112	3036	If there is a book that is so bad you wouldnt want your kids reading, why would it of been published	6
1113	3036	Publishers do read the books they publish them, they will not publish any random thing	7
1114	3036	I think that they just need to leave the unsensored things alone	8
1115	3036	If you cant be mature enough to take a article, book, or magizine seriously, then you dont need to be reading it anyway	9
1116	3036	In the news or radio you always hear about some boy getting bullied and stuff at school	10
1117	3036	That isnt because of unsensored things, why dont they blame it on parents and ask where they were at	11
1118	3036	Parents look at anyone and everyone, but themselves when a kid comes home and has learned a cuss word or somthing	12
1119	3036	It is never the parents fault	13
1120	3036	If people pull unsensored things out of the library it will serve no purpose and thats just my opinion	14
1121	3036	I know that i have no say in it and thats ok i can still believe that i am right	15
1122	3036	Thank you for your time	16
1123	3037	When you were a child how much did you learn from books	0
1124	3037	Books are filled with great stories of far-away lands, accounts of real events, and poems with powerful meanings	1
1125	3037	All of those books were written by an author with a clear point to make	2
1126	3037	Those books should not be censored from libraries because of words or ideas that are found offensive	3
1127	3037	Children have to learn these things some time in their life and I think the earlier they learn the less trouble it will cause them later in life	4
1128	3037	There are also freedoms in the @LOCATION1 that grant us freedom of speech	5
1129	3037	Shouldn't there be a freedom to read as well	6
1130	3037	Authors are brilliant people	7
1131	3037	Without them, there would be no books for anybody to read	8
1132	3037	We should all respect authors and what they put into their books	9
1133	3037	This means when an author believes that a certain word or action fits in a book, we should leave that book alone and respect what the he or she chose to put in it	10
1134	3037	When I was a child I picked up on everything	11
1135	3037	I was a very inquisive as any kid my age would be	12
1136	3037	I remember wandering around my public library scanning the rows of books and reading the titles	13
1137	3037	There were books about politics, religion, sex, and violence	14
1138	3037	However on the other side of the library, there were books about children escaping their own world and traveling through time in a magical tree house	15
1139	3037	There were even stories about mice who had feelings and normal conversations amongst themselves	16
1140	3037	The library is great because of the plethora of knowledge contained in the unrestricted inventory of books	17
1141	3037	As I grew older, I began to dwelve into more adult books such as politics and religion	18
1142	3037	I then formed my own personal opinions on what I gathered from the books	19
1143	3037	Without those books in that library I would have never been able to research those topics	20
1144	3037	There is an amendment in our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 that  promotes freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1	21
1145	3037	This allows for anybody to say whatever they please as long as they don't infringe upon the @CAPS2 of anybody else	22
1146	3037	The definition of library is a place where people can read and check out books from library and return them when they please	23
1147	3037	Libraries should allow every book in their collection because every book has some sort of value	24
1148	3037	Taking a book out of a library because of offensive material is not right because books are important no matter what is inside of them	25
1149	3037	Some books @MONTH1 have material that might not belong in the hands of children	26
1150	3037	Children need to learn those things sometime in their life	27
1151	3037	Why not now	28
1152	3037	Books are what have taught all of us	29
1153	3037	Please let them keep teaching	30
1154	3040	Should censorship be used on library books	0
1155	3040	Obviously if you are talking to an adult then yes, more than likely they don't want their pupils to be learning inappropriate words, but if you ask any student the same question you will probably get mixed answers	1
1156	3040	Some might say' I don't appreciate hearing or reading those words,' others might say' sure why not, I hear them on televison, see them on the internet, my parents say them so why can't I read them.' To me personally I don't think it's that big of a deal to have a few inappropriate words in a book, but they shouldn't be allowed on shelfs in a middle school's library or lower	2
1157	3040	High school and up I think that its okay to have on the shelves in magazines, books, music and movies	3
1158	3040	When I was a child my mother always said don't cuss, but growing up in an enviornment where the overwhelming majority of people you talk to cuss, then after awhile it comes out like normal words	4
1159	3040	So why not have it in the books, and movies	5
1160	3040	It's not like we don't know what the words mean	6
1161	3040	If they hurt your feelings then you know not to read, listen or watch it again	7
1162	3040	I'm not saying cuss words are good and that it's ok for them to be in every sentence you say, but hearing or reading a few won't kill you	8
1163	3040	In some cases, cuss words are good for a story	9
1164	3040	Sometimes your reading a book and someone gets in an argument, you don't even realize it till the argument is over, but with sometimes when there is a cuss word, you stop and say,' @CAPS1 something is going on here, and I want to know what it is.' @CAPS2 catches your attention and keeps you hooked on whatever it is until you find out what happened	10
1165	3040	Consequently	11
1166	3040	movies, books, music, and magazines with foul language does have an affect on our youth	12
1167	3040	A lot of children are cussing at an early age, but thats just how people communicate, show emotions, and get someones attention	13
1168	3040	Censorship can take away a lot from a book, overall making it less interesting, so again I believe censorship should not be a deciding factor in choosing a book, movie, music or magazine	14
1169	3040	Choose it because it looks interesting and its something you might enjoy	15
1170	3041	There are many books that are offensive to people	0
1171	3041	I personally agree	1
1172	3041	There are many things that shouldn't be seen by children.There is alot of material out there, weather its books, movie, and other things that have a bad influences on children	2
1173	3041	Children learn by watching and observing	3
1174	3041	They learn from us and our generation	4
1175	3041	What better way to protect them than by removing their bad influences	5
1176	3041	First, children watch movies and they see to people kissing and one thing leads to another	6
1177	3041	Some movies even show people having sex	7
1178	3041	What kind of influence is that on the children	8
1179	3041	Than the children learn and they go out there and do the same thing	9
1180	3041	Teen pregnacies have jumped threw the roof	10
1181	3041	High @CAPS1 are filled with pregnant teens	11
1182	3041	Any where you go I garentee you will see a pragnant teen	12
1183	3041	Some girls even get pragnant right after they have developed and were able to have kids	13
1184	3041	Now imagine if we were able to stop that	14
1185	3041	Theres a way	15
1186	3041	dont let the children watch these programs, that way they won't be tempted	16
1187	3041	Secondly, there are books and movies and other things that show the children shooting and killings and how people get away with it	17
1188	3041	This could be a very bad influence	18
1189	3041	There are video games with shootings and have limbs flying all over the place	19
1190	3041	Well the children will learn from those video games and movies	20
1191	3041	They think that killing someone is ok and you can get away with it	21
1192	3041	Bad influences like that make the children think it's ok to do things like that.There have been children who have killed their parents for a video game	22
1193	3041	Then the children become cereal killers or go on a shooting spry at school	23
1194	3041	Is that not much evidence at all to show the people that something is wrong	24
1195	3041	We need to take imediate control of this situation and stop it before one day you see your child on television for killing someone	25
1196	3041	Finally, all the children are getting lazier	26
1197	3041	All children do is lay down and watch tv or play video games	27
1198	3041	Their lazyness causes obesity	28
1199	3041	Their are many kids to whom this topic refers to	29
1200	3041	No parent wants to see their kid over weight for many reasons	30
1201	3041	Children being obeast causes lots of depression	31
1202	3041	The child feels sad because they feel ugly and they lose self esteem	32
1203	3041	Thechild then becomes shy and quiet	33
1204	3041	In some cases the child trys to comit suicide because otherchildren are teasing them in school everyday	34
1205	3041	I know any parent wouldn't want their kid to die	35
1206	3041	These are things that are happening and parents need to open their eyes and see whats happening before its to late	36
1207	3041	In conclusion, to prevent all these catastrophies their has to be change	37
1208	3041	Their are many harmful and bad influences out their today that can determine the childrens futures	38
1209	3041	There still time for change, so lets do something about it	39
1210	3041	Lets try to reduce teen pregnancies, bad influencial video games or movies, and instead of watching movies and playing video games all day get up go outside and go for a walk	40
1211	3041	These are little things we can do to make a change for good	41
1212	3042	I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 think that books should be censored	0
1213	3042	There are no books, besides maybe math books, that @CAPS1'@CAPS2 offend at least one person or a group of people	1
1214	3042	Books are an important part of the learning system	2
1215	3042	If a certain book offends you then you @CAPS1'@CAPS2 have to @CAPS3 @CAPS4	3
1216	3042	@CAPS4's that simple	4
1217	3042	there is no need to over react to words on paper	5
1218	3042	Besides there are more important issues at the moment	6
1219	3042	While being offended by a book is bad, we must realize that some people are going through things that are way worse than that	7
1220	3042	People who do drugs or have a family member that does drugs are an example	8
1221	3042	A better example would be the parents or gaurdians of a kid who was killed either by accident or on purpose	9
1222	3042	One of the most common but overlooked examples is the what the loved ones of people who die serving our country go through	10
1223	3042	As you can see if people can live with that then we can definantly handle an offensive book	11
1224	3042	Censorship causes blidness	12
1225	3042	What I mean is, if we censor one offensive book then we have to censor every book that someone finds offensive	13
1226	3042	All men are created equal, right	14
1227	3042	So they'd have to censor the book	15
1228	3042	If a book offends you that much then listen up, @CAPS1'@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4	16
1229	3042	Just because a book is offensive to you doesn'@CAPS2 mean @CAPS4's offensive to everyone	17
1230	3042	sometimes a history book could be considered offensive so we censor @CAPS4 and then we @CAPS1'@CAPS2 learn about the mistakes of our past and repeat them	18
1231	3042	The point is if a p erson can handle some of the things I've mentioned, then we can all handle a little bit of words on a little bit of paper.	19
1232	3043	This is what's wrong with today's society	0
1233	3043	We are too soft.We're too worried about what other people might think if we say this or do that	1
1234	3043	I'm the kind of person that doesn't care about other peoples feelings	2
1235	3043	And I say that to an extent	3
1236	3043	If we're talking about my friends, family, my girlfriend, that's totally different	4
1237	3043	I show a lot of respect to those people on a daily basis	5
1238	3043	But as far as people I don't know, I could care less what their beliefs, opinions, and outlooks on life are	6
1239	3043	Maybe we should stop worrying about other people for once and just try to grow and prosper as a race	7
1240	3043	Anybody ever think of that	8
1241	3043	If I had it my way, the @ORGANIZATION1 would not exist	9
1242	3043	@CAPS1, radio, books, movies, magazines would all be uncensored	10
1243	3043	Is life filtered and censored	11
1244	3043	Absolutely not	12
1245	3043	So why should those things be	13
1246	3043	I'm sick and tired of people constantly sheltering their children from lifes normalcies	14
1247	3043	They've gotta learn sometime	15
1248	3043	Life isn't lollipops and rainbows	16
1249	3043	It's hard, unforgiving, and it kicks you in the teeth	17
1250	3043	You've just got to learn to adapt to it	18
1251	3043	And censorship in libraries, on @CAPS1 etc, won't and aren't helping matters in the least bit	19
1252	3043	I guess I don't understand why we have to care so much	20
1253	3043	If everybody just relaxed a little and focused on themselves, we would be fine	21
1254	3043	Everytime I hear the word 'offensive' it makes me sick to my stomach, because in my eyes, that word doesn't exist	22
1255	3043	It's a made up word that really means we care about other peoples feelings more then we do our own	23
1256	3044	I don't Believe in censorship of libraries	0
1257	3044	Were @CAPS1 we live in a free country, and have the right to have access to the matrial we want from libraries	1
1258	3044	It doesnt matter if its age aproprite or not	2
1259	3044	If you dont want your kids listening to that bad rap artist, or watching that @CAPS2 rated movie, then its your responsibility as a parent to keep it from them	3
1260	3044	Part of what makes @LOCATION1 so great is the freedom that come with living here	4
1261	3044	If we allowed anyone to censor a library then we would have no books to read, movies to watch, or music to listen to	5
1262	3044	Katherine paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hompe none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	6
1263	3044	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	7
1264	3044	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' this quote shows that if anyone had the right to pull a book from the shelf we wouldnt have any books left	8
1265	3044	Censorship would just be the start.It could lead to the government censoring information from the public that they don't want us to know	9
1266	3044	which would take away the greatness of @LOCATION1, we wouldn't be free	10
1267	3044	Censorship of libraries would take away our rights	11
1268	3044	witch is why i apose it	12
1269	3045	Should books, magazines, music, movies, and ect	0
1270	3045	be censored for certin age levels	1
1271	3045	No they should'ent	2
1272	3045	Books can be very educational	3
1273	3045	Sometimes you can't even find a book with out bad things in them	4
1274	3045	Even if they do, sometimes it's the only way to learn some of the rich history of our country	5
1275	3045	Books can't be censored from children	6
1276	3045	Why you ask	7
1277	3045	Because the reason people read books is to learn	8
1278	3045	To learn about love, math, history, and much more	9
1279	3045	These books are writen by adults, not for adults, but for everyone to read	10
1280	3045	I read lots of books, and every book that I read I learn someting new	11
1281	3045	Back in the ninetinth and twentith centerys, cursing was huge in books	12
1282	3045	But it wasent just to curse, it was to show the full dioulge of the character	13
1283	3045	It also set the mood of the era, and the place, where the story is being held	14
1284	3045	Such as in war books the characters curse a lot	15
1285	3045	The reason for this is that if a man gets shot in the leg and all he said was,' @CAPS1!!' That isn't how the character would act	16
1286	3045	The man would curse his lungs out	17
1287	3045	Not literly but when the author writes what someone would truely say, the reader will have a better understanding of the characters in the book	18
1288	3045	As the quote says, everyone has the same right to read, which is true	19
1289	3045	Its true because everyone has a right to be interested and learn about what they are interested in	20
1290	3045	Right	21
1291	3045	I myself strongly belive they everyone should choose what they want to learn about, and then have the freedom to do that	22
1292	3045	So should books in a library be censored	23
1293	3045	No defenitly not	24
1294	3045	its the best way for people to learn what life is really like	25
1295	3045	Sometimes you can learn anything with out reading a book with curse words, sex, or violance	26
1296	3045	People worry that reading books like this will create bad people if they learn these things at a younger age	27
1297	3045	But it wont, it will only show them how not to act	28
1298	3045	And can only create a better person.	29
1299	3046	I belive if the books, music, movies, magazines and etc	0
1300	3046	are offensive and are bad that they should be removed, the reason being is because of younger children	1
1301	3046	Younger children are not aloud to be exsposed to that stuff if it's bad or not pertand to them	2
1302	3046	Since there are books, music, movies, magazines and etc	3
1303	3046	that are bad and offensive, then I would suggest a room or some sort of place that they can be held and were only adualts can be around them and can get to them	4
1304	3046	Movies and magazines are my biggest thing that would worry me	5
1305	3046	There are more bad things in them then in books or music	6
1306	3046	Books and music have bad language but very rarely have bad images or other things like that	7
1307	3046	If there happen to be a book, music, movie, or magzine that you or any other person thinks that is inaproprete or offensive then you or that person would have permision to take it off and show it the main desk, and let them know what you think about it	8
1308	3046	I feel that they should seperated the censorship in libraries to keep the children safe	9
1309	3046	They should steel be aloud to have censorship books, music, movies, and magazines because adult can handle that kind of material to where younger children can't	10
1310	3046	So therefore to keep everything sepreate, and there shouldnt be no problem.	11
1311	3047	Many people are very stern about there thoughts when they believe in something very strongly	0
1312	3047	In other peoples eyes you @MONTH1 find some who disagree and do agree with you from having similar life experiences	1
1313	3047	All of which peoples opinions are created by life experiences and many tragedy' they have been apart of	2
1314	3047	You will find sooner or later that some of the problems that many people deal with, that there is someone who has a lot worse than you do and that you should enjoy every moment you can	3
1315	3047	Opinions are alternated often about many different things, being a homosexual is one of the many that people debate about most often	4
1316	3047	In my opinion it doesn't really matter whether your homosexual or not you have to understand that everyone is different in there own way	5
1317	3047	Exceptence is what' key to making eveyone get along at some point, but people struggle with homophobia	6
1318	3047	Another big debate that many people have are with female and male opinions	7
1319	3047	It seems as if they dont get along because they disagree, but neither could live without each other	8
1320	3047	It's nearly impossible to find a male or female who agree' with you @PERCENT1, unless there pretending to be something there not	9
1321	3047	From life experiences from parents arguing, friends fighting, and other relatives you see people forgive and forget so easily because the world is supposed to gifted and cherished everyday	10
1322	3047	All in all I believe that most books are based off of reality and other peoples visions on the world and what they see	11
1323	3047	I also find it interesting when people are very dramatic when trying to get there point across	12
1324	3047	It helps others get a clear picture of who and what they go through.	13
1325	3048	I believe that all the books are meant to be in the library	0
1326	3048	People would not want them gone if they thought of it the way I do	1
1327	3048	It makes sense that we need all sorts of books to learn from	2
1328	3048	Some books @MONTH1 seem bad, but when you think about it there is always a good lesson to be learned	3
1329	3048	There are many different reasons why all books should stay on the shelf, but here are a couple of mine	4
1330	3048	Two years ago there was a boy named @PERSON1	5
1331	3048	On many occations he found himself in bad situations that he did not know how to deal with	6
1332	3048	Many parents do not talk to their kids about certain things, such as drugs	7
1333	3048	This makes kids unaware and curious to figure out the truth	8
1334	3048	He had no other way of figuring out about how to handle fights, drugs, and alcohol unless he read about them in a book	9
1335	3048	When he was almost sixteen years old he began to hang out with a bad group of teenagers	10
1336	3048	They were going to take @PERSON1 to a party	11
1337	3048	@PERSON1 secretly left his house and went because he was curious	12
1338	3048	When he got to the party, everybody began to drink	13
1339	3048	He knew that he always wanted to try it, yet he was not going to because he had to be home before his parents got up at five the next morning	14
1340	3048	After several hours of setting on a couch watching everybody else do it, they finally had him talked into it	15
1341	3048	He figured that one would not hurt	16
1342	3048	Well before long, one became two, two became four, and it just kept going up	17
1343	3048	@PERSON1 was having so much fun that he lost track of time	18
1344	3048	He looked at the clock and it was three a.m., he got really worried	19
1345	3048	He didn't know what to do until he thought back to a book he read	20
1346	3048	The book was about a guy who was out drinking, the guy had know other way home than to drive	21
1347	3048	The guy decided he would just drive home because he was not very drunk	22
1348	3048	When he was driving home he pulled out on a highway at the wrong time	23
1349	3048	A semi hit him in the left side of his car	24
1350	3048	After thinking about that book he decided to be brave and call his parents	25
1351	3048	@PERSON1 knew that he would get punished, but he decided that grounding would be better than injury, or even death	26
1352	3048	@PERSON1 had his dad come get him from the party	27
1353	3048	He was grounded for two months	28
1354	3048	It would have been longer if his parents had not been so proud of his decision in the end	29
1355	3048	@PERSON1 was happy with his decision as well	30
1356	3048	Events such as that are the exact reason why I think that almost any book belongs on the shelf	31
1357	3048	The story in wach book helps everybody comprehend what should be done in a real life situations	32
1358	3048	I know that books help me figure out many things	33
1359	3048	Even what to do and what not to do	34
1360	3048	If you just give every book a chance you will find a good reason for it to be read	35
1361	3049	Do I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be romoved from shelves if they are found offensive	0
1362	3049	Yes, I think they should be romoved from the shevles if they are found offensive to some or the majority of people	1
1363	3049	Some can be a bad influence on younger kids	2
1364	3049	Some can be offensive to someone's race or religion	3
1365	3049	It could also be offensive to people based on who they are or what they do	4
1366	3049	Some materials should be romoved because of the kind of infuence they have on younger kids	5
1367	3049	Some books can have violent language and actions in the book	6
1368	3049	Most magazines have inappropiate articles that they should not be reading or even looking at	7
1369	3049	The music nowadays are very explicit and do not need to be in hands of kids	8
1370	3049	Some parents don't even care about the music but it is one of the biggest influential things out	9
1371	3049	So that's one reason why certain books, music, and magazines should be romved from shelves	10
1372	3049	There are a lot of music and movies that are very offensive to certain races and religion	11
1373	3049	Hip @CAPS1 is one of the most explicit kinds of music and is very offensive to all kinds of religion and some race of people	12
1374	3049	Movies are the same with music	13
1375	3049	Magazines have certain articles that are racist and certain articles that are very offensive to certain religions	14
1376	3049	A lot of magazines have stories about celebreties that are very bad, sad, and private	15
1377	3049	In the past there have been some celebreties that sued some magazines and newspapers that put the wrong story out or something too private out	16
1378	3049	Those are just some ways and reasons why certain books, movies, music and magazines should be removes from shelves if they are found offensive	17
1379	3049	No one knows how people feel abouit themselves or things around them	18
1380	3051	The library is a pathway to knowledge, which branches to many different cultural roads	0
1381	3051	It has expanded from just a place of books to a building which also houses music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media	1
1382	3051	But, there begs the question if certain materials should be excluded if they deemed to be offensive	2
1383	3051	There are many ways to approach this question	3
1384	3051	Is censorship an answer to offensive materials or an answer to what is not 'politically correct'	4
1385	3051	Often, people will claim certain work to be unjust without understanding the viewpoint of the supposed victim	5
1386	3051	It is quite ironic that the people with the power - who stand up for offended parties - often do not understand them more than the creator of the work	6
1387	3051	Another reason for censorship is to protect children from unwanted material, which is very understandable	7
1388	3051	But, where in the process do parents have control of what exactly they want their children to access	8
1389	3051	I believe it is the resposiblity of the parent to determine such restrictions	9
1390	3051	If a parent gives a child unlimited access to material at a library, then the child should be able to explore wherever their curiosity takes them	10
1391	3051	If the parent chooses to limit access, then they should be active in the process of selection	11
1392	3051	It is the right of the individuals who birthed and raise these kids to determine how they are guided	12
1393	3051	I myself am a musician, which is no more artistic in a sense than any other creator, such as an author	13
1394	3051	My creations are expressions that I give for world to enjoy and think about	14
1395	3051	To remove the work of an author in a library is to damage his ability to spread his thoughts	15
1396	3051	Of course, there are other outlets to acquire books, but the library is one of the greatest outlets	16
1397	3051	There are a couple complications that will arise in censorship on libraries	17
1398	3051	What guidlines do you have in determing excluding the offensive materials	18
1399	3051	If a material offends one person, is that sufficient enough to exclude it, or do you need a larger group	19
1400	3051	It is unrealistic to always get a complete consensus of a group's opinion, so how do you determine whats offensive and whats not	20
1401	3051	In all, I believe that everybody should have the ability acquire whatever material they want from a library	21
1402	3051	It is an institution that is allows one to go places that they will never go and live lives they never will live	22
1403	3051	Its ability to do such should not be compromised.	23
1404	3052	In third grade, I took a book off the shelf of my local library that had an interesting cover	0
1405	3052	It was rather large, but I had come to love reading in that time of my life so I decided I was up for it	1
1406	3052	The genre of the book was fantasy which I enjoyed immensly	2
1407	3052	Although, there were some parts of the book that had me confused	3
1408	3052	There were scenes involving women that I did not understand, and many new words	4
1409	3052	Eventually, I came to ask my dad about a certain part of the book	5
1410	3052	He read the passage, and his eyes went wide	6
1411	3052	I never finished that book	7
1412	3052	There is no doubt that I had a learning experience by reading that book, but, as my dad obviously thought, it @MONTH1 have been a little too much for that time in my life	8
1413	3052	If it were not for my mom not wanting to make a big deal out of it, my dad would have had a little chat with that library	9
1414	3052	Now that I am old enough to understand what was going on in that book, I realize that I lost some of my innocense because of it	10
1415	3052	There is simply some material that is not appropriate for children, and it should not be put in our public libraries	11
1416	3052	Not censoring what is put on the shelves seems obsurd considering my experience	12
1417	3052	If I have a son someday, I want to be the one telling him about the touchy subjects of women and swearing	13
1418	3052	it should not be from some fiction book	14
1419	3052	I also do not appreciate the other material found in our libraries	15
1420	3052	The music that I see has artists that write their songs without children in mind, movies have up to @NUM1 ratings, and magazines promote gossip and have sexual references	16
1421	3052	Overall, it is disappointing to me that our libraries have allowed some of these things onto their shelves	17
1422	3052	As I think about my experience in third grade, I wish I had never seen that book	18
1423	3052	Maybe it would have allowed me to keep a little more innocense for a little bit longer, and maybe I would have respected women more through my youth	19
1424	3052	I would love to see more censorship in libraries so that we can protect today's children until the parents choose to open their eyes to the world.	20
1425	3053	Have you ever noticed how much bad materials are out there for childeren to get ahold of	0
1426	3053	A movie, book, magazine, music, or even something on @CAPS1	1
1427	3053	It would be nice to get rid of all that bad material, but what if someone else doesn't feel the same way about that song, movie, or @CAPS1 show	2
1428	3053	I think it would be horrible if we took away all the bad materials because it might bring violence between some people who disagree on it, and it goes against one of our rights, freedom of speech	3
1429	3053	In the world we live in today, if you take something away from someone like their favorite book, its going to bring out some violence between some people	4
1430	3053	Look back into our history, we are a country full of rebels	5
1431	3053	That is how @CAPS3 even came to be	6
1432	3053	So take away something from people they are going to stand up and fight for it	7
1433	3053	There will always be people trying to smuggle and hide some things, so we will never be able to get rid of it completly	8
1434	3053	If you take away all the bad materials it would be taking away one of our rights, freedom of speech	9
1435	3053	Some materials out there @MONTH1 be offensive to others, but it's not like we have a right to get rid it	10
1436	3053	It's not like there is any book, magazine, or even a song out there that someone doesn't get offended by	11
1437	3053	If we do take away all the offensive materials we should take away everything	12
1438	3053	So what is the point we all will never all agree on something, we can't please everyone	13
1439	3053	In taking away all the offensive materials you are taking away people's right to freedom of speech	14
1440	3053	Don't try to take away all the offensive materials, it will just bring violence and make it all much worse than it was	15
1441	3053	If you're a parent it's not like you can shield your children from everything because eventually they will learn what it all is	16
1442	3053	So it won't do any good to try to get rid of it	17
1443	3053	It will still be around	18
1444	3053	It is just something in our world that we have to live with	19
1445	3054	Do you believe libraries should remove items some people find offensive	0
1446	3054	Do you find some items offensive and want libraries to remove them	1
1447	3054	@CAPS2 is a major problem that many people don't think about often before acting	2
1448	3054	Here are some situations many people run into:     If one person finds a @CAPS1 offensive but no one else does, should @CAPS2 be removed	3
1449	3054	Many libraries contemplate whether or not they should remove an offensive item due to some peoples' opinions	4
1450	3054	This is because they know people like @CAPS2 and they know people don't	5
1451	3054	they wonder whether or not they should remove the item because a few people find @CAPS2 offensive, (this can range from books, music, movies, magazines, etc.)	6
1452	3054	People often think they do what is best for everyone by asking the library staff to remove something they think is offensive	7
1453	3054	Honestly, they're only helping the people that want to have @CAPS2 removed and don't say anything, that is if the library removes the offensive item	8
1454	3054	If the library removes the offensive item, they @MONTH1 lose a customer, if they don't remove the item they @MONTH1 lose a customer	9
1455	3054	So they are faced with a dillemma, 'remove the item or don't remove the item?' @CAPS2's a tough decision to make especially when they @MONTH1 lose more than a few customers based on either choice	10
1456	3054	So what do they do	11
1457	3054	They @MONTH1 poll the customers and see what they think, they @MONTH1 do nothing at all, or they @MONTH1 remove the item to keep the person happy	12
1458	3054	The problem is what happens if @CAPS2's a friend who liked the item and you don't want to hurt their feelings because the item has been there forever and they love @CAPS2 so much, but can't afford to buy @CAPS2 at a store	13
1459	3054	What do you do then	14
1460	3054	People often don't want to think of other people's' feelings and/or the decisions they would have to face over something as small as 'an offensive' item, and they say things that they wouldn't normally say just to get said item 'out of their sight.' @CAPS3 is they just don't want to agknowladge other people's' choices, feelingings, opinions, etc	15
1461	3054	So what would you do if you found an offensive item at the library	16
1462	3054	Would you ask for @CAPS2 to be removed	17
1463	3054	Say nothing	18
1464	3054	@CAPS2 is your choice in the end, but not all people have the same tastes in books, music, movies, magazines, etc	19
1465	3054	that you do	20
1466	3054	So think about other people's' possible feelings, thoughts, opinions in mind before making a decision.	21
1467	3055	If you were offinded by a book in the library would you want it took off the shelf	0
1468	3055	I wouldn't there is no point in removing it there are a lot of books that offend people, that one book isn't just towards you the same goes for movies and music	1
1469	3055	Books should be able to be written about any and everything that interests people	2
1470	3055	Some people @MONTH1 not find the same thing offending like you do everyone dont think alike	3
1471	3055	If books were made towards emotions or about how people would look at them then there wouldn't be that many books in the world today	4
1472	3055	This is a free country and we have the write to speak and write about whatever we want to get out	5
1473	3055	Movies are anoter way of getting you emotions or expressing yourself	6
1474	3055	People find most movies offending but neither are movies made up of how people feel about it	7
1475	3055	We are able the express any and everything we can in whatever it is that we do in movies	8
1476	3055	No one or no race is the center of attetion in movies people @MONTH1 feel as if they are but thats a personal thing people @MONTH1 go through	9
1477	3055	Music can be produced or even rapped or sung in many different ways to get to people	10
1478	3055	Music @MONTH1 be found most offending now days but, music is also away of getting emotions and freedom of speech out	11
1479	3055	I've never felt offended because of a song i've heard or anything people are going to say what they feel and want	12
1480	3055	Freedom of speech goes a long way in the world people either gotta het used to it or stay offended	13
1481	3055	Books,music,movies, or magazines wont be pulled because of emotions	14
1482	3055	I look at it as a way of art expression that shows how people think and respond to things	15
1483	3056	Many books and material in libaries are sometimes offensive to certian people but that does not mean they should be taken off the shelves of libaries	0
1484	3056	Material that might be offensive to one person might have a valuable intrest in another person	1
1485	3056	If you hated the subject of history and had the right to take it away, then someone else might come along and take away a subject you like like, science	2
1486	3056	If it is offensive to the general public, it should be placed in a special scection, be avaible behind the counter, or avaible only at specific libaries	3
1487	3056	Throught the libaries of the world, there are two general sections, adult, kid, and entertaminet sectioons	4
1488	3056	In these sections locate many topics and many views of ceartian things	5
1489	3056	Sometimes it is very offensive and it is almost 'hidden' from view and have to spend all day looking for it	6
1490	3056	It should be that contreverstial topics should be kept in a closed off section of the libary and can be accesed by the staff so that way none of the pubic can worry	7
1491	3056	Like cigarretes at a store, somethings should be behind the counter where the material can have a watchfull eye over it	8
1492	3056	These subjects include sex, racisim, porn, polotics, and other material like the ones listed	9
1493	3056	With these items behind the counter, people will not know about it and it will be hidden from view, but still acesiable with special order or request	10
1494	3056	This would help the public	11
1495	3056	Some material, when reached to a specific town, can cause an uproar that can shake an entire community	12
1496	3056	Some material should be denied from entering small towns and the specified material can only be aquired at large libaries or specific book stores	13
1497	3056	With material far away, people can be reassured in small towns that material will never upset their community	14
1498	3056	This is why some material should only have premettid acess under watchfull guard	15
1499	3057	I do not think that they should be taken off of the shelf because some people find it offensive	0
1500	3057	The way i look at it is, is that everyone has their own beliefs and rights their own opinions	1
1501	3057	Not everyone is going to think alike	2
1502	3057	As an example some people are against blacks and others are not	3
1503	3057	Everyone thinks different and have their own opinions therefore, they should all be able to listen to whatever	4
1504	3057	Not everyone is going to like what you like and listen and believe everything you do	5
1505	3057	Don't read it if it offends you, but just cause it offends you doens't mean that someone else out there doesn't believe in it or likes it.	6
1506	3058	All throughout the world there are libraries	0
1507	3058	Librairies have all different kinds of materiel stacked upon shelves	1
1508	3058	Most of the material is helpful and enjoyable but some is not	2
1509	3058	I think libraries should be able to have whatever they want on their shelves	3
1510	3058	Yes, i understand some of this material @MONTH1 be inappropriate for a certain person but there is a way you can fix this	4
1511	3058	If libraries have inappropriate books, movies, music, ect	5
1512	3058	I think they should be able to keep them	6
1513	3058	Just because some people do not that material does not mean everyone won't like it	7
1514	3058	Everyone has their own style, everyone likes different things and has different opinions	8
1515	3058	Isn't that what makes the world go around	9
1516	3058	Adults @MONTH1 have a problem with the offensive material because they have children who go to the library	10
1517	3058	I understand there concern but there can be a way to stop them from getting to the inappropriate material	11
1518	3058	If libraries are going to have this kind of stuff in their libraries i think there should be a blocked off room where kids can't go	12
1519	3058	That way the people who like that kind of stuff can still get to it but the children can not	13
1520	3058	We go to school for a vast amount of reasons	14
1521	3058	Some being	15
1522	3058	to learn, to get us ready for college, and to be independent	16
1523	3058	While we are at school not only are we learing things like math and evolution, but we are also learing whats going on in the world around us	17
1524	3058	If you haven't noticed, all that is out there anymore is bullying, cursing songs and horrifying movies	18
1525	3058	We, as children and teenagers see and hear about this everyday	19
1526	3058	Since we learn and already know about all of this 'offensive' stuff, why not have it in our libraries for other people who want to study it	20
1527	3058	There is alot of different kinds of material in libraries	21
1528	3058	Some good for kids and teenagers and some inappropriate	22
1529	3058	I understand the concern for parents on censorship in public libraries, but there is a way to stop it	23
1530	3058	I think as long as its blocked off into a different room, everyone will be fine and it will cause no harm	24
1531	3059	Censorship is the idea of blocking or removing things that are  offensive to peoples belief's, their religion, their race and just their ways of life	0
1532	3059	Therefore, i do not belive that books in libraries should be censored	1
1533	3059	I understand that things that people write can be offensive to yourself or others, but what if you found a book that was descriminating someone elses belief's but not yours	2
1534	3059	Would that still be okay with you to take those book off of the shelves?Also, taking books out of a library is not going to stop kids from learning about things that are not age approprite	3
1535	3059	If you do not want your child learning about them do not let them get it	4
1536	3059	You censor what your child reads and do not punish the people who go into the library and need the book	5
1537	3059	There would be no more libraries if people really wanted to start taking books off the shelf for being offensive	6
1538	3059	Some people in this world would just take the matter too far and get offended by everything	7
1539	3059	The things that people will read in books or magazines and see in movies is nothing compared to what they will see in the real world	8
1540	3059	So if anything, the books that @MONTH1 be offensive to people only show you that you will not like everything that someone writes or says	9
1541	3059	As far as movies, they are already rated on a decent scale	10
1542	3059	If it is not age approprite, then do not watch it, or let your children	11
1543	3059	The same applys for video games and music	12
1544	3059	Censor them from your children, and do not get them censored from the whole world	13
1545	3059	That is my opinion about censoring things from libraries	14
1546	3059	Just because you do not agree with every little thing that someone writes, does not mean that someone else in the world does not	15
1547	3059	Out of all the things that need to be censored the library is not one of them	16
1548	3059	Of all the places, taking things off of the library  shelves is not going to do justice of what really needs to be done	17
1549	3060	Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reason	0
1550	3060	The first reason being  what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else	1
1551	3060	The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other	2
1552	3060	The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is	3
1553	3060	The first reason is that what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else	4
1554	3060	In this society we live in we shouldn't go base on ones option because everybody has a right to freedom of speech	5
1555	3060	History show that many different people found different thing to be offensive because some people think that book that haves gays shouldn't be in books, but many feel otherwise.That a good example on how people have different opition	6
1556	3060	The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things	7
1557	3060	The libraries being a place to study and learn should have a bus load different things even if some take offensive to it	8
1558	3060	Infact some books teach us that we shouldn't get offfensive because that what one person feels and at long as your got someone who love you it doesn't matter	9
1559	3060	The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is	10
1560	3060	Books are a way for someone to give there own point of veiw if you dislike it don't take offensive to it and try to removed it from the shelves	11
1561	3060	The @LOCATION1 has a government where they take everybodys opition	12
1562	3060	A prime example of this is the state funding schools which is a big issue we shouldn't just removed the school because someone doesn't like it	13
1563	3060	In conclusion certain materials shouldn't be removed from shelves if they're found offensive for three reasons	14
1564	3060	The first reason being if you found something offensive it @MONTH1 not be to someone else	15
1565	3060	Next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things	16
1566	3060	The last reason being if we all just removed thing we dislike the world wouldn't be the way it is.	17
1567	3061	Dear Katherine Paterson,         Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed form the shelves if they are found offensive	0
1568	3061	I honestly don't think that's nessecary because not everybody @MONTH1 find those materials offensive	1
1569	3061	If a couple people think that a certain book or something is offensive then dont read it or pay attention to it, don't take something from someone that they like	2
1570	3061	I think that if  there was people that found a certain topic interesting and there was also people who found it offensive, that they should keep the material and the people who dislike it would just have to get over it	3
1571	3061	Either way I think that they shouldn't remove those materials, enless everyone agrees that it's offensive.That's not fair to everyone else who likes that topic, just because one person found it offensive	4
1572	3061	Now if a magazine for the public is being racist or something like that then maybe that can be considered being removed, but other than that I see no reason why you should take away something that some people @MONTH1 enjoy	5
1573	3061	Let's say I enjoy movies, books, or magazines about hunting and people find it offensive to kill animals for the fun of it or for food	6
1574	3061	Just because that single person doesn't like that certain thing doesn't mean they should take it away from everyone else	7
1575	3061	That's just there opinion on things and you can't always get what you want, so just deal with it	8
1576	3061	Well those are my thoughts on rather or not you should remove materials that some people find offensive	9
1577	3061	My last opinion is if you don't like the material and it offends you don't read it or have anything to do with it	10
1578	3061	Other than that you shouldn't take materials away from people enless everyone agrees on it	11
1579	3061	Sincerly,                                                          @PERSON2	12
1580	3062	Many @CAPS1 have different opinions about what's appropriate and what's not	0
1581	3062	It's depends on one's beliefs and morals	1
1582	3062	I personally don't think that there should be any censorship in libraries	2
1583	3062	I think that @CAPS1 should have the freedom to choose what to read, watch, or listen to	3
1584	3062	Each person should be able to make a decision depending on what they believe	4
1585	3062	It also depends on a person's age and maturity level	5
1586	3062	Some parents let their kids watch certain movies that maybe other parents wouldn't	6
1587	3062	The situation is different for each person	7
1588	3062	It's hard to judge certain materials because some @CAPS1 might find it acceptable while others might not	8
1589	3062	There would be contraversy over virtually everything because everybody has different standards of what's acceptable what's not, and these standards would clash with each other	9
1590	3062	It would be impossible to make sure that nothing in libraries would be offensive to @CAPS1	10
1591	3062	If someone finds something offensive, then they don't have to check it out	11
1592	3062	I also think that there are some things that can be done to help appease the argument	12
1593	3062	For example materials can be catorgorized by maturity level	13
1594	3062	That's what movie ratings are for	14
1595	3062	Materials should be organized that @CAPS1 can easily see if they would be offensive or not	15
1596	3062	For example all the kids movies and books can be put together so that way parents don't have to worry about their kids seeing or reading something that would be inappropriate	16
1597	3062	It should be obvious to @CAPS1 who would find it offensive and who wouldn't      @CAPS1 should have the individual freedom to make decisions for themselves	17
1598	3062	A library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want	18
1599	3062	Just because somebody finds a book offensive, that doesn't mean that nobody should be allowed to read it	19
1600	3062	That being said, certain things can be done so that @CAPS1 would know if something would be offensive or not.	20
1601	3063	How would you feel if you wrote a story about your life, and someone found it offensive, so the took the book off of the shelves	0
1602	3063	I feel as if the censorship in libraries is becoming a controversial problem for the following reasons: it is wrong to take away freedoms, people have different opinions and views, and some books, magazines, or songs are trying to make people aware of dangers	1
1603	3063	One important aspect in why censorship is becoming controversial is	2
1604	3063	it takes away our freedom of speech	3
1605	3063	In @LOCATION1, we have the right to speak our minds	4
1606	3063	If everything we read was censored, there would be nothing to read	5
1607	3063	The liberties and freedoms of @CAPS1 citizens should not be taken away because of something that is thought to be inappropriate	6
1608	3063	Another reason why I believe censorship is wrong is	7
1609	3063	different people have completely different opinions on things	8
1610	3063	One person might feel that a book about a sexual assault victim is offensive, while another person might think the book is informational and helpful	9
1611	3063	No one can base censorship on one belief or idea, because it will never be the belief or idea that everyone approves of	10
1612	3063	A third reason why censorship should not be inforced as much is	11
1613	3063	it takes away the awarness of the dangers in everyday life	12
1614	3063	Stories about people who were kidnapped, or were in a car crash because the person who was driving was under the influence of drugs, can be a good thing	13
1615	3063	Eventhough the story @MONTH1 have some accounts that are not appropriate, it could be very influencial, and convince someone to make the right choice	14
1616	3063	If we censor stories about abduction, drugs, alcohol, or people making the wrong choices, no one will be able to read a story about it and make the right choice instead of making the same mistake as the person	15
1617	3063	Although stories or magazine articles that @MONTH1 be seen as vulgar are looked down upon, they help to make people aware, give people the freedom of speech, and allow them to have their own opinions	16
1618	3063	Censorship in libraries and media should be abolished	17
1619	3064	I actually do believe that they should be able to be removed from the shelf	0
1620	3064	On the other hand i do not believe that anything rascist should be on library shelfs	1
1621	3064	Teens these days want to be able to pick up a book that they can actually relate to and the same thing goes for a movie, nusic, and a magazine	2
1622	3064	You can't help what people want to listen to or like to read or watch	3
1623	3064	I don't really like robot movie's or any of that crap so that wouldn't be something i'd pick out to watch	4
1624	3064	On the other hand i don't think that it should have to be removed out of the library just because i dont like it	5
1625	3064	Also something like @CAPS1 in the @LOCATION1, i don't think that it should be removed from shelve's just because of the title	6
1626	3064	Family @CAPS2 is a really funny show but also has a lot of bad language in it but i don't think it should be removed because thats what people like to watch	7
1627	3064	Teens want to be able to read about they can relate to, but some of the things in the book can be offensive maybe	8
1628	3064	If they didn't have anything to read that they could relate to hardly anyone would read	9
1629	3064	Not everyone listens to the same music but a @NUM1 yr old doesn't want to go around listening to barney, they want to listen to the music that they like and think is cool, but on the other hand others @MONTH1 not like it	10
1630	3064	Not letting you get something off of the library shelf because it's bad is like saying you can't eat a certain kind of food because its bad for you	11
1631	3064	If people didn't get to listen to, read, or watch the things that they like they would be screwed and very upset	12
1632	3064	I think people are entitled to their own opinion, although some people's opinions could be rather stupid	13
1633	3064	Not everyone likes the same things and we shouldn't have to.	14
1634	3065	From my own observations I do not beleive that any materials should be removed from libraries	0
1635	3065	All students have the right to read/learn about different subjects	1
1636	3065	Even if that includes some of them being offensive	2
1637	3065	Some subjects might be considerderd offensive, like the holocaust for example	3
1638	3065	If we didnt learn about what happened during that horrific time it could possibly happen again without us even knowing that it has happened before	4
1639	3065	But it is the students choice to read about that subject or to simply ignore it if it is cosidered offensive	5
1640	3065	In conclusion I do not beleive that materials in libraries should be censored or removed from shelves	6
1641	3065	People need to learn a little about everything that goes on in this world to be a better, more educated, well-rounded individual.	7
1642	3067	How would you feel if you were at your local library and you found something with something offensive in it	0
1643	3067	Many people would not approve of having offensive materials in their library	1
1644	3067	The library is open to anyone and anyone could see the material	2
1645	3067	Library's should make sure there isn't anything offinsive in their materials before they put them on the shelf	3
1646	3067	Everyone has access to the library in your district and can look at anything that is there	4
1647	3067	A lot of stuff that can be found in your library could be offensive	5
1648	3067	but how would people know what is offensive and what isn't	6
1649	3067	Library's shouldn't have that accessable	7
1650	3067	If they still have it in your library, then it should have a warning on it or be on a high shelf	8
1651	3067	Library's should be aware of what they are putting on the shelves and know if it is appropriate or not	9
1652	3067	Furthermore, children also have access to the public library	10
1653	3067	Most of the time the child will have an adult with them but sometimes they can pick up something before you can stop them	11
1654	3067	If there is something offensive in a child's reach, they might grab it and see whats in it	12
1655	3067	Most librarys have a childrens section where you can trust that there isn't anything offensive in it	13
1656	3067	Not all children will just go to the childrens section so there shouldn't be offensive material in library's or at least in childrens reach	14
1657	3067	Lastly, librarys choose what they put on the shelves and they never know who will look at it	15
1658	3067	If there is offensive material in their stuff then anyone can see it and it could put a negative thought in some peoples heads	16
1659	3067	There are some people who are mature enough to see the offensive material but there are others who can't	17
1660	3067	Thoes that can't, it @MONTH1 reflect something negative on them and it @MONTH1 cause problems	18
1661	3067	Therefore, there should not be offinsive material in librarys	19
1662	3067	In @CAPS1, librarys should not supply offinsive material	20
1663	3067	If there are people that want to see that kind of stuff there are other ways of getting that material	21
1664	3067	There shouldn't be access to that in your library because everyone can see it and you don't know how it will effect them	22
1665	3067	If there is going to be offinsive material in your library there should be an adult area where only people over the age of @NUM1 can enter	23
1666	3067	If there is something offinsive that is open to anyone, hopefully one day librarys will elimanate them.	24
1667	3069	If you walk into a store and see a book you dont like or a magazine you could care less for, should you be able to get rid of it	0
1668	3069	My answer to that is no you should not	1
1669	3069	You do not own the libraries books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store	2
1670	3069	You are the viewers and buyers to these suppliers and if you dont like it dont buy it or look	3
1671	3069	When I was in the eighth grade I went to @LOCATION2 for a church missions trip	4
1672	3069	There was alot of cool things there that I saw	5
1673	3069	This was one of the most popular places in the @LOCATION1	6
1674	3069	When we wouldn't be working or serving others we would walk around and do some shopping	7
1675	3069	There is alot of people in this city and it was packed all the time	8
1676	3069	Now with that being said there was alot of different stores and there are some in my opinion at the time that i thought were very inappropiate for my age level	9
1677	3069	My whole group walked into a store where we just really didnt belong and we all had no clue this was the kind of store this was	10
1678	3069	Our actions simply invovled nodding our heads good bye at the cashier and walking out continuing our day of shopping	11
1679	3069	We did not remove any books, pictures, or even magazines in that store	12
1680	3069	Reason being is that, that was their store and we had no right to remove anything	13
1681	3069	After we left there other people walked in that store and liked what they saw if we would have removed those items they wouldnt of got to see what they liked	14
1682	3069	That would be like someone removing something from a store I like meaning i'd never get to see it and I wouldn't want that	15
1683	3069	If you walk in to a store and see something you do not like you shouldn't be able to try and get rid of that object	16
1684	3069	Whether you want your kids seeing it or not you just cant do it	17
1685	3069	You take your own risk walking into a store and seeing what they have in store for you.You are there to browse around or buy a few things if you would like too	18
1686	3069	Every store should have their own certain things and what you find offensive other people might like	19
1687	3069	That goes for the opposite too what other people find offensive you might like	20
1688	3069	It is all a big chain with many loops	21
1689	3069	So say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display	22
1690	3069	Now that material is gone all because of you thought it was offensive	23
1691	3069	Say another person walks in the ame store and takes something off the shelve that they thought was offensive	24
1692	3069	Now there is two things gone from the shelve, but you actually liked what they took off the shelve and your upset that they took that off	25
1693	3069	This will cause alot of conflict and big situations in the future if this was allowed	26
1694	3069	One person likes it one person doesnt	27
1695	3069	If you dont like what you see in a store then you shouldn't walk in or you should simply ignore the stuff that is offensive to you	28
1696	3069	These are some of my opinions about this catagory	29
1697	3069	I believe you shouldn't be able to take stuff off shelves and terminate other stores products	30
1698	3069	Always be aware of what your getting your self into and know the outcome of the decisions you make	31
1699	3069	This could cause alot of lossed jobs and many conflicts between shoppers and viewers like you	32
1700	3069	I hope you take this into consideration and understand my reasonings for what I have said	33
1701	3070	Libraries are very educational	0
1702	3070	They provide books, movies, magazines, music, and computers for you to locate something you are looking for	1
1703	3070	I dont think that libraries include anything offensive	2
1704	3070	If anyone finds anything that a library has that is offensive to them, then they should talk to someone who works there and see if they can come to a solution	3
1705	3070	It shouldnt be removed because not everyone @MONTH1 find it offensive	4
1706	3070	I've been to many libraries in my life and personally, it's amazing all the books, and things for you do there	5
1707	3070	I've actually gained alot of knowledge at the libraries i've been to because i found so many books that were just amazing	6
1708	3070	Never, have i ran into something that was offensive to me or anyone else	7
1709	3070	Everyone is different though, we have all have a different view on things and we all are unique	8
1710	3070	If a library does have something that's offensive to everyone then maybe it should be removed but like i said earlier if it's not offensive to everyone then it shouldnt be removed	9
1711	3070	I personally, think libraries hold so many unique things that if somethings were offensive to people then i'd understand why everyone would want it to be removed	10
1712	3070	If someone came up to me and said 'hey, i find this music to be very inappropriate for young children to listen to' i would say, 'well, that @MONTH1 be true, but some children do listen to that music, it wouldnt be fair to remove it, just because one person doesn't like it	11
1713	3070	Now, from my experience theres alot of things that people find offensive but personally, i think it would be outside of a library	12
1714	3071	Definately not, they @MONTH1 be offensive to some but not all	0
1715	3071	Everybody will be projected to offensive material sometime in their life, so their is no real reason to censor materials	1
1716	3071	These materials are made to entertain someone, some are entertained by offensive material	2
1717	3071	I honestly dont think that anything in the library is so offensive that it needs to be took out	3
1718	3071	If any material offends you, you dont have to acknowledge it, you can always check out different material	4
1719	3071	If censor material then you are going against the first amendment, @CAPS1 of @CAPS2	5
1720	3071	Everyone will find something offensive about a certain material and demand it gets taken off the shelf or censored, what happens when every book has been marked as offensive	6
1721	3071	We have no books, thats what	7
1722	3071	Books are made by the author writing down his idea's and creating a plot, some will think his idea's are offensive but not all will	8
1723	3071	Whether people think its offensive or not people still enjoy those books	9
1724	3071	Anyone can create material and share their idea's, those idea's could still be offensive but it doesnt matter, because we have @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 to say whatever we want and to not be prosecuted by it	10
1725	3071	If you ban any type of material, your prosecuting the voice of the creator's opinions, then all your doing is denying the @NUM1 amendment & being a hypocrite	11
1726	3071	Censorship of music and movies is not right either	12
1727	3071	When you censor movies and music your also censoring out their idea's	13
1728	3071	Music is an expression of life and censoring that would be like censoring emotion	14
1729	3071	Censorship of the movies, music, & books is just prohibiting the expansion of culture	15
1730	3071	All im saying is censorship is destroying america and hurting our progression in culture.	16
1731	3072	Have you been to a library and saw no books or magazines on the shelfs	0
1732	3072	Well if the libraries try taking away all the books and magazines that are offensive then there wouldn't be anything there to read	1
1733	3072	If you pick up a book or magazine and you think it offends you then don't read it, grab a knew one	2
1734	3072	through out this article you will hear about how movies can be offensive, and how libraires shouldn't empty their shelves over it, then my belief against this topic	3
1735	3072	Movies, books, magazines and music can be offensive	4
1736	3072	If you think about it though if you get offended then don't read or listen or watch it	5
1737	3072	You just simply have to grab a new book	6
1738	3072	Now the question comes, what if its the best book or movie up there	7
1739	3072	If thats the case then watch it but just know its your own choice to	8
1740	3072	If you really want to get those books, movies, etc., off those shelves then grab one that just really offends you and take it to the manager and ask him/her to read it or you read a part to them	9
1741	3072	If he/she don't she a problem with it tell him/her to read from your perspective and then think about it	10
1742	3072	After you get done with that ask him/her wants a stack of the books, etc., that offend you	11
1743	3072	Thats when you start piling up the stacks right in front of him/her	12
1744	3072	The libraries on the other hand if your getting bombarded with people coming in and sayin this books offends me I can't belive this on your shelves, what if a little kid got ahold of this.......	13
1745	3072	Managers or owners if you get people coming in to tell you to read this book, watch this movie	14
1746	3072	What do you do	15
1747	3072	In my opinion i'd read or watch maybe the first two or three but after that i'd start playin it off and just agreeing to get them out of your office	16
1748	3072	Now you gotta think, man if all these people keep coming in here and saying these books, movies, etc	17
1749	3072	are offensive then you really got to take action	18
1750	3072	If you take books away from the libraries then you loose sales	19
1751	3072	I've been to a lbrary where everything was catagorized so people know what there looking through before they start reading which is what I think all libraries should do instead of just putting them out on the shelves	20
1752	3072	My belief on the topic is that you go into a lbrary knowing whats in a lbrary, books	21
1753	3072	Now if you go in there and theres a book or movie that alot of people complained about then i'd see them making an effort to get rid of it	22
1754	3072	But if your the only one then i highly doubt they will make a special effort to get rid of it	23
1755	3072	You also got to think the author of the book didn't write it just to offend you, their not singling you out.If its that bad where you can't read or watch it without something setting you off then take it back ang grab a new one	24
1756	3072	If that book or movie is their best seller they're not going to destroy it because of one single person	25
1757	3072	So if you go to a library and check out a book or movie without knowing whats it about then I wouldn't blame them for not doing anything about it, its your choice not theirs	26
1758	3072	This article took alot of diffrent sides which is good in a way because its not just about one single topic	27
1759	3072	However if you keep nagging on the manager to get that book or movie out of there and they still don't do it then go to a different library	28
1760	3072	Maybe that library wont have as many books, movies, magazines, etc., to get offended about and if there is maybe they will be cool about the situation and try fixing the problem to benefit the two of you	29
1761	3072	So if you read this article and get offended by it then sorry, just expressing personal opinion and trying to get you to solve your problems	30
1762	3072	thanks for reading	31
1763	3073	What are we hiding from	0
1764	3073	Is personal expression really that bad	1
1765	3073	Questions such as these come to mind when the topic of censorship in libraries arises	2
1766	3073	In my own personal opinion I believe forbidding works of art from libraries is the same as destroying the people @CAPS1 created them	3
1767	3073	Censorship in general is a way to hide reality and sugar coat the struggles within life itself	4
1768	3073	One can not learn unless given the oppurtunity to face the problems in society and the world	5
1769	3073	By banning certain pieces, the world destroys an opportunity to expand the knowledge of every individual	6
1770	3073	With the removal of materials such as books and music, libraries ruin the time spent and heart that the creators have placed trustfully within them	7
1771	3073	Although most people use these materials strictly for entertainment, the writers and musicians created them for self expression and to show their pain and struggles	8
1772	3073	It could even be said that expression such as this is theraputic for these specific individuals	9
1773	3073	How would you react if your form of art was dibbed unsuitable for a public audience	10
1774	3073	Would you be hurt and taken back	11
1775	3073	Many artists probably feel that they are being placed in a state of seclusion and hatred	12
1776	3073	With the creation of art there is always a deeper meaning behind them	13
1777	3073	The biggest question in my eyes is, ' @CAPS1 deems that material as unsuitable for libraries'	14
1778	3073	What can be so wrong with specific material that we must take it away from everyone	15
1779	3073	At the pace our world is going today their will be no individualism left within the next fifty years	16
1780	3073	If people are not even allowed to listen to specific types of music, sooner or later people won't be able to wear certain types of clothes or even dye their hair a different color	17
1781	3073	The human population's greatest gift is their ability to be different	18
1782	3073	If our society cannot even handle freedom of expression through art, how can it handle any other type	19
1783	3073	Libraries are created as a place to expand knowledge	20
1784	3073	If materials are censored how can anyone learn	21
1785	3073	Every individual has their own way of thinking and interpreting subjects	22
1786	3073	A book seen as entertainment and down-time reading to one person @MONTH1 be the very thing that strikes a world changing idea in the mind of another	23
1787	3073	A human's greatest idea comes strictly from the knowledge they have accumulated throughout their life time and off of their interests	24
1788	3073	If certain forms of art are censored individuals will never be able to find that form of interest in certain subjects	25
1789	3073	Everyone will strictly be forced to believe and learn the same things, restricting the world from the magical ideas one man could have formed with the information obtained from the art that had been censored	26
1790	3073	In a discussion based class I previously took, we read an article discussing the @ORGANIZATION1's decision to ban any information related to the loss of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and the terrible things their society had done in their attempt of complete succesion from the @LOCATION1	27
1791	3073	Through ideas such as this, you are not only taking knowledge, but also implanting lies into the heads of the next generation	28
1792	3073	In that specific situation in the @ORGANIZATION1 it created a hatred and false sense of the @CAPS4 in the childrens' eyes	29
1793	3073	How can one specifically influence the beliefs of a child @CAPS1 is only @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old based off of their personal selfish beliefs	30
1794	3073	Through censorship we are destroying the truth and knowledge that each individual deserves if they are determined to find it	31
1795	3073	The biggest thing about censorship is the cover up of reality	32
1796	3073	Do libraries think if they do not publically display a controlversial topic no one will know about it	33
1797	3073	Knowledge is all around us	34
1798	3073	No one needs a book to tell you our world is not perfect	35
1799	3073	For all we know, a book censored could have saved millions of lives	36
1800	3073	I cannot fully grasp the concept in my head of hiding materials from the public	37
1801	3073	There will soon come a time where expression at all will be censored	38
1802	3073	If we are getting rid of art should we remove people too	39
1803	3073	I can relate censoring books to censoring people based on my own personal experience	40
1804	3073	A teacher once told me that I would not ever achieve my career, because I had piercings	41
1805	3073	Opinions such as these could kill a person's dreams	42
1806	3073	I have known that I wanted to be a lawyer since I was seven years old and have been working to better my education based on my goals	43
1807	3073	How can you tell someone that they are not good enough based on your specific beliefs	44
1808	3073	There will always be something in the world you do not like	45
1809	3073	Each library @MONTH1 decided to censor a different type of art from their individual location	46
1810	3073	Eventually the world will have no art left, because those few people chose that it was not suitable for everyone	47
1811	3073	I can almost guarentee that most individuals have lived through worse experiences than what are being covered up	48
1812	3073	The world cannot be sugar coated or portrayed as perfect, because that is not lfe	49
1813	3073	Everyone will struggle at some point and its works of art that really get us through it	50
1814	3073	Sometimes we relate to them or in my case art such as music is what makes me feel better when I am hurt	51
1815	3073	The pain will always be there	52
1816	3073	Going through reality and the struggles is what makes each individual @CAPS1 they are	53
1817	3073	Censorship in libraries will not hide anything from the public, it will just destroy an oppurtunity to grow	54
1818	3073	Censorship in libraries is what will destroy our world	55
1819	3073	No individual can say that material is not suited for the public, because they are not the public	56
1820	3073	Every person poses their own opinions on life	57
1821	3073	By banning these works of art you are banning individuality as a whole	58
1822	3073	If things like this continue our planet will become mindless zombies will no personal opinions	59
1823	3073	Libraries will be taking knowledge from everyone and ruin the chances for greatness for many people	60
1824	3073	There is no true way to hide reality from the world	61
1825	3073	Let people display their feelings through their art and share it with the world	62
1826	3073	The struggles of one person @MONTH1 be what saves another and allows the ideals of the world as a whole to grow	63
1827	3074	Several years ago a parent at my school complained to the administration about a book, The @PERSON2, her child was about to read for his english class	0
1828	3074	She believed that it was an inappropriate book for a ninth grader to read	1
1829	3074	She was in her rights to be a little nervous about the book, there had been concerns from within the school when it had been added to the ciriculum	2
1830	3074	The administration eventually decided to keep the book as part of the class because even though the approprietness of one scene @MONTH1 have been in question the rest of the book taught lessons taht were important to children, like tolerance for other cultures, the imaortance of right and wrong and that you must fix the things that you have done wrong	3
1831	3074	Although I understand that parents do not want to expose their precious children to the rest of the world, I believe that it is important to be exposed to a wide variety of materials because it helps people learn about different cultures and other ways of life	4
1832	3074	I once read a quote that said something a long the lines of understatnding leads to tolerance	5
1833	3074	We cannot ban books and other media because we think they are inapproriate for a situation	6
1834	3074	Being able to understand another person's culture or point of view @MONTH1 one day lead to the solution of problems in out world today, such as the crisis in the @LOCATION1 involving the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2	7
1835	3074	I agree very much with the quote by Katherine Paterson about how if we all take away books and other media that we dislike we would have nothing left	8
1836	3074	A good example of this is the popular internet video site, @CAPS3	9
1837	3074	There are thousands of videos listed on this site and millions of people who watch them	10
1838	3074	On each video there is a place to leave feedback on whether you liked or dislike said video	11
1839	3074	With all of the different viewpoints, opinions, and interests of the millions of people who have viewed this site it is very difficult to find a video without at least one or two dislikes	12
1840	3074	If we all had the power to take videos we disliked off the site, there would be none left for us to watch	13
1841	3074	Another reason why we cannot just remove offensive things from our shelves is that without authors taking a little rebellious flair and exposing new ideas, the material we read would quickly becme very boring	14
1842	3074	During the women's suffrage movment, the men of this country thought the idea of women being allowed to vote was offensive	15
1843	3074	Now after many years it is seen as a commonplace thing and it is now a legal right for women to vote.This is an example of how a once radical idea has now gained support and made people's lives better	16
1844	3074	If we take these books from our shelves we are harming ourselves and allowing us to become ignorant	17
1845	3074	All books and media have value, whether they express just one person's ideas or the thoughts of thousands	18
1846	3074	We remove material from our shelves at a risk to ourselves as individuals and as a society as a whole	19
1847	3074	I believe that the founding fathers of our country knew what they were doing when they included the freeedom of speech in the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6	20
1848	3074	If we remove books and other media from the literal and figurative shelves of our society, are we not denying the authors, writers, singers, and publishers who made those works their freedom of speech?	21
1849	3075	The old saying one should never judge a book by it's cover comes into litteral meaning with this particular subject	0
1850	3075	Every mind that is among the world is extremely different, just as every book is	1
1851	3075	One person @MONTH1 look upon a certain subject as offensive, while others @MONTH1 not have the same point of view	2
1852	3075	However, in my personal opinion books with 'suggestive' references or language should be placed in sections marked mature and clearly labeled with a warning of the contents lieing between the pages	3
1853	3075	With over a billion different points of views residing all over the world, why should books that only a few select find inappropriate people be removed	4
1854	3075	Every person has their own life story and rough experiences	5
1855	3075	Life's journey brings bumps in the road which can scare someone deeply and change their life forever	6
1856	3075	While reading a book, a viewer @MONTH1 skim across a passage that brings horrible experiences swelling back up in them	7
1857	3075	For one to have to relive a trauma that they have struggled to get over isn't right, but for another to read about a situation similar to a particular person's life journey could possibly grant them more understanding and compassion for the victim	8
1858	3075	I do not believe victims of abuse no matter what degree should have to read about that subject in a book they thought they were reading for leisure	9
1859	3075	However, these books should not be taken off the shelves because people who have not had to endure a struggle such as this should be able to grasp a better understanding for the other person	10
1860	3075	Books for a more mature mind should be monitored and placed upon a shelf out of reach from a child who can not yet handle that topic	11
1861	3075	At a young age I selected a book I had thought was a ghost story	12
1862	3075	Mid way through I came to the understanding that the book was truly about a young girl my age being raped	13
1863	3075	As a sixth grader I was horrified because I was not yet exposed to that danger of the world, and I was not mature enough to handle that subject	14
1864	3075	For weeks I walked the halls scaared that I might have the same fate as the girl in the story I had read	15
1865	3075	Books with mature topics should be seperated from those for younger childeren, because the description in a book @MONTH1 leave a child with emotional scares	16
1866	3075	Labeling books clearly with any 'suggestive' content the book @MONTH1 contain would help this issue tremendously	17
1867	3075	If books are clearly labeled that they contain offensive words, comments, or horrifying situations, then a reader who will become offended will have less likely of a chance to grab the material	18
1868	3075	If children who are still developing their level of maturity come across a book that mentions inappropriate subjects, they will have a better understanding of what they @MONTH1 be about to view	19
1869	3075	By simply pressing a label on a book that states the concerns can be found within the pages, it will save the world alot of harm	20
1870	3075	If books begin to fly off the shelves because of offensive topics, their won't be many books left to read	21
1871	3075	Every person takes a different look at what a story says, just as every age group comprehends the message that passages give differently	22
1872	3075	By monitoring and labeling books, book worms will be able make a quick decision on whether or not the material they think they want to read is for them	23
1873	3075	So, in conclusion don't take away the wanders of reading from those who enjoy traveling through the imagination of books, but let them know exactly what they will see as they mosey through the unknown pages of a new adventure.	24
1874	3076	Yes, I believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the book shelves if they are found offensive to someone	0
1875	3076	First of all a oerson doesn't go to the library to get offended	1
1876	3076	Also if the liberian should know whats appropiate for the library	2
1877	3076	And items like the ones who offend people should not even be in a public area	3
1878	3076	A person does't go to the library to see something that offends them	4
1879	3076	People go to the library to read, study and to have a quiet time	5
1880	3076	And the people that go to use the library for a resourse, should not find themselves in a situation were they feel that they are being offended by a book, movie or magazine, because of what the autor says in the writeing	6
1881	3076	People might get offended and stop going to the library	7
1882	3076	Also the liberian is incharged of the items he wants to display in his library	8
1883	3076	If the liberian feel that a book its okay to be displayed he can dispay it, but if the book is offensive to someone else, he should be asked to remove the book	9
1884	3076	And if the book is resourceful for study the liberian should keep it in an area were people that want the book can ask for it	10
1885	3076	Stuff like that should not even be published in a public area	11
1886	3076	I think that there should be a law that does not allow offencive literature, music, movies etc..	12
1887	3076	In libraries	13
1888	3076	Now this days people are allowed to donate items of litereature or intertainment to libraries, but i think that people should make sure that the items they are donateing are okay to be displayed	14
1889	3076	So yes I believe that offensive materials shoud be removed from the libraries	15
1890	3076	Because libraries are places were you go to have a quiet time to read and not to get offended	16
1891	3076	The librarian should be incharged of what he or she wants to dislay	17
1892	3076	Aand last stuff like that should not even be in a public area	18
1893	3077	It seems you cannot always make everyone happy	0
1894	3077	No matter what, someone is offended or upset over something	1
1895	3077	This holds true with everything- including media	2
1896	3077	Whether it be a book, movie, or a song, someone somewhere will be unhappy with it for some reason	3
1897	3077	Though this is true, it certainly does not mean you can take that media away from those who enjoy it	4
1898	3077	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 that all people are granted freedom of speech and freedom of press	5
1899	3077	Would taking 'offensive' material off of shelves not take away from this right so clearly and intently given to us	6
1900	3077	Not only that, but does sheltering the public and making us all believe the world is a place without bias, prejudice, or slander really help us in the grand scheme of things	7
1901	3077	Pretending that the world is perfect ensures that future generations of the world will be devestated by reality once they get out in the real world and realize everything is not perfect and nice and unbiased all the time	8
1902	3077	My ninth grade year in high school, I read 'To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5' by @PERSON1	9
1903	3077	This book demonstrates the harsh prejudice that used to be normal in the @LOCATION4 during the earlier years of the @LOCATION1	10
1904	3077	This book could certainly be considered offensive by a person living in the southern @LOCATION1	11
1905	3077	one could say this book steriotypes people in the @LOCATION4	12
1906	3077	One could also say this book is offensive because of the language it uses	13
1907	3077	African-@CAPS6 could be offended by the explicit rascist comments and names within the pages	14
1908	3077	Despite this, 'To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5' is considered a classic and is praised and tought throughout the @LOCATION1 and the rest of the world	15
1909	3077	I grew from reading @PERSON1's masterpiece- it tought me a lot about where the @LOCATION1 has been and how far it has come with acceptance of other races	16
1910	3077	You learn from your mistakes, they say	17
1911	3077	Therefore, we can learn from the media's mistakes	18
1912	3077	We can grow as people from being offended or having offensive material brought to our attention	19
1913	3077	We can stop history from repeating itsself by being well-informed	20
1914	3077	Theology is a huge matter of dispute among all cultures	21
1915	3077	@CAPS9 or @CAPS10'ite, @LOCATION2, @CAPS11, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION5, @CAPS12	22
1916	3077	Any book store you walk into, you can find a bible or a book on atheism or even '@ORGANIZATION1,' which focuses on @CAPS13	23
1917	3077	Any music store you walk into, you can find bands that bash the ideas of religion, but you can also find theistic worship bands or meditating music	24
1918	3077	Just the same, any movie theater or movie store you visit could supply movies with anti-theistic or pro-theistic themes.Taking such things off of the shelves because one work could be offensive to a group of people could limit another's options to explore theology and find out what suits them	25
1919	3077	It could limit one's exploration of interests	26
1920	3077	It could very well take away from one's personal growth	27
1921	3077	In any case, it is unfair to take something that could be considered offensive to one person away from another just for the sake of being nice and having discretion	28
1922	3077	Putting a ban on certain works could harm the flow of society	29
1923	3077	Putting a ban on certain works could limit one's awareness of the world around them or the history they could potentially be inspired by, it could limit the expansion of one's intellect, it could take away from one's exploration of interests or the search of who they really are or want to be	30
1924	3077	It is best to just keep things the way they are- free.	31
1925	3078	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc ...,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
1926	3078	Most of the people made books that are inapropiate or offensive and sometimes are the life of the person or some experience that they have live	1
1927	3078	But the problem is that a lot of people are not realistic and they don't thing that those is the live of person's and can be the future of more people.Peple sometimes like to be the best and can make problems with other and that mekes them happy that is a sad thing because that's bad and also they can get of the point of do things so bad that they go to jail that's are some of the experiences that people shows  but others get it wrong	2
1928	3078	well thats their problem they can do what ever they whant 	3
1929	3078	I know that live is not easy but thank's of that material we can have a better live and also we can deffence ourselves	4
1930	3078	Also i don't think that they  need to be remove that books or magazines because that's what help us to have e better life and also in the future, they need to be in there and if people found them offensive just don't go there or don't see that materials ignore them more people like those and thinkthat are helpful for them and for me	5
1931	3078	I don't think that they goin to have a bad material in there, things that are inapropiate i thing that they can't have bad or  nasty information in a place that a lot of people go and not only adult also childre's  go too	6
1932	3078	And that's is more inappropriatefor kids	7
1933	3078	People know what's going on in there and some others persons know too	8
1934	3078	the world sometimes is a danger and sometimes help us for grows up that's is a good thing but we hace the choise if we want to read or have that information	9
1935	3078	I remember one time when i read a book that is kind of sad but that help me to know better our life it was about two boys the book has a lot of bad words and talk really bad bad olso that explain more the book and we learn more about it	10
1936	3078	that's some things that help us with life	11
1937	3078	One of the books, magazines,music,movies .etc  that we can write is our life because we pass a lot of difficults times and that is a book of our life and can be a inappropriate book of our live.people like me give the tanks to those peoples that publish they experiences and at the same time help us	12
1938	3079	I think that books, music, movies, magazines, and etc	0
1939	3079	should be aloud to stay on the shelves of stores and libraries	1
1940	3079	We have to ask our selves these questions	2
1941	3079	Why should we take them out of libraries	3
1942	3079	What would people have to read when those books tell us about what went on in the early days, such as slavery, automobiles, and etc.	4
1943	3079	Who wants to sit and read about other stuff that is just down right boring	5
1944	3079	Why should we take down the books in the library	6
1945	3079	We shouldn't take the books down off the shelves	7
1946	3079	We @MONTH1 have the right to take down the books but why should we	8
1947	3079	It is taking away the knowledge for our children	9
1948	3079	We would be taking away a lot of stuff the our children should know about, such as the slavery, and famous people	10
1949	3079	What would we have to read about if we took most of the books out of the library	11
1950	3079	We would have nothing to read about other then the stuff that doesn't matter to us anymore	12
1951	3079	You have to think about if we took all of the books that were inappropraite off the shelves of the library there wouldn't be anymore books	13
1952	3079	Every book out there has something bad in it, so we would have to take away all the books other than the little kids books	14
1953	3079	Who would want to go to the library and want to sit there knowing that they are going to be reading something that is not interesting and just boring	15
1954	3079	I can tell u who wants to do that	16
1955	3079	Nobody,'' it's just dumb to do it and has no point, unless you are old, then you @MONTH1 like to, but not everybody is old	17
1956	3079	Reading is fun to some kids and they want to read about different stuff, but if we take the books they can't	18
1957	3079	We don't need to take any books out of the libraries	19
1958	3079	There would be no reason to go to the library or even read books, cause there isn't any good ones	20
1959	3079	We are just taking away something that is really big to us @CAPS1, and without those books there is no history for us to study	21
1960	3079	Our kids need to see those books even if we don't want them to	22
1961	3079	That is the early days and they need to know about all of it and how it was back then when they didn't have everything we do now	23
1962	3079	You can't take away something that is fun to do so why take them	24
1963	3080	I've recently read a letter from Katherine Paterson about censorship in libraries	0
1964	3080	This is my opinion expressed in words about how I feel about the whole topic	1
1965	3080	I've been reading ever since I hit first grade	2
1966	3080	To be honest, I couldn't tell you the names of @PERCENT1 of them because..	3
1967	3080	well I just can't remember them	4
1968	3080	I'd like to think that it's because I have a horrible memory, but the truth is, they were just unappealing and unmemorable books	5
1969	3080	In all aspects, these books could be considered a waste of my life	6
1970	3080	Back then, I guess I only read them because I had nothing better to do, which is horrible because you should read books because you want to	7
1971	3080	I stopped reading books at around seventh grade because every book I picked up seemed to be extremely boring and it would take the first one hundred pages to actually have something decent happen	8
1972	3080	Luckily, there is light at the end of this tunnel	9
1973	3080	Every now and then you come across a book that changes your life	10
1974	3080	Not literally, but it feels that way at the time (which is what you should feel)	11
1975	3080	These are the books I remember	12
1976	3080	These 'life-changing' books all have things in them that would interest anyone who picks them up	13
1977	3080	Unfortunately, these things would be viewed as innappropriate to a select audience	14
1978	3080	For example, one book @MONTH1 talk about murder and be viewed as highly offensive by a person whose mother had been murdered, whereas the same book could be viewed as a piece of art by someone who has escaped the terribleness of death	15
1979	3080	Apparently it has gotten to the point where people would have the books censored or have them removed the libraries completely	16
1980	3080	I can stand idle no longer	17
1981	3080	Books all go through a long, drawn-out process before they are shelf-ready	18
1982	3080	They need to be written, read, and selected to be published	19
1983	3080	For some books, this can take years	20
1984	3080	To completely alienate these books is extremely unfair to the time that was put into them	21
1985	3080	If you don't like the books, don't read them	22
1986	3080	It's as simple as that	23
1987	3080	If that's not enough reason for you, think of it this way: a book about a child getting raped and fighting to overcome it could serve as inspiration for rape victims	24
1988	3080	Or, a book about someone's parents dying could help a child in the same situation overcome the grief	25
1989	3080	All books serve a purpose and should remain staunch on the shelves of local book stores, regardless of the methods used in them	26
1990	3080	Even if they don't appeal to you, it could be a completely different experience for someone else halfway across the world	27
1991	3080	Let these books serve their purpose.	28
1992	3081	What do you want your child being exposed to	0
1993	3081	In my own opinion I believe that @CAPS1 shouldn't be taken off the shelfs, because kids know what books are appropriate and innappropriate for them	1
1994	3081	This @CAPS2 why the library has @CAPS3 'kids' selction away from the 'adult' selction	2
1995	3081	They know their boundaries, and I don't think a librarian would let a child check out anything innappropriate	3
1996	3081	The library @CAPS2 a place for all sorts of books for anybody to come and have the right to check them out	4
1997	3081	Also, @CAPS3 not just librarys', @CAPS1 can be seen or heard from schools, on the radio, t.v	5
1998	3081	and video games	6
1999	3081	Any where you go they're more likely going to see innapropriate actions that take place	7
2000	3081	So as a parent @CAPS3 your job to keep your child away from the things you don't want them to see or hear as much as possible	8
2001	3081	The only way a child can be exposed to this @CAPS2 if their parents are unattended and irresponsible	9
2002	3081	Someday your kids will ask questions about that that kind of stuff they hear or see at school from other students	10
2003	3081	Just be open and honest at the right time but in a mature clean matter	11
2004	3081	I know alot of young children these days who are being exposed a lot from violent video games, music about drugs, alchol, and sex	12
2005	3081	@CAPS1 really bothers me, because when I was their age I had no idea what @CAPS1 even was or meant	13
2006	3081	@CAPS1's wrong for the parents to let them be around that when they know @CAPS1 has a label on @CAPS1 saying '@CAPS10 @CAPS11', '@CAPS12'  or '@NUM1'	14
2007	3081	Every time I hear a child say something about this aweseome video game or cool new song they heard on the radio about drugs, violence and etc, the children tend to get younger and younger every time	15
2008	3081	I don't understand why parents let them be exposed to that unecessary stuff	16
2009	3082	NEWSPAPER     @CAPS1 today im going to tell you what I think on offensive materials in libraries.Offensive materials such as books,magazines,music,movies are found in libraries to some people.But to others they can think its perfectly ok to have in a public place.Thinking somethings offensive is just an opinion and every person has a different look on things	0
2010	3082	The first thing I have to say about this topic is that these items should not just be taken off the shelves and thrown away.Some people can find these items very educational and they might be able to relate to that  book that other people would say is offensive.And if offensive materials are really bothering some people and the libraries are getting alot of complaints they should just make a section in the library just for the offensive books,movies,ect.So people wont have to look at those offensive materials.Another thing is that libraries are a public place and they should have a wide range of books,movies,ect.Because not every one likes the same thing.People have different intrests and outlooks on different things.So people should just except the things that they might not be into because other people might be really into that.And dont always just think about yourself look at the big picture	1
2011	3082	So there are some of my thoughts and feelings on what I think about offensive materials in libraries.And I hope that you can see my point that im trying to get across.	2
2012	3083	Do you believe that certain things need to be taken off the shelf that's uncensored for my children to see.No, I honestly do not because the library shouldn't have no uncensored things put up on the shelves that our children might not see.Cause the staff shouldn't let the children in that area without a parent were the uncensored books, magazines, movies, music and etc	0
2013	3083	But it's know ones fault because the media staff that works in the library shoudn't allow the younger kids to go in that area were those things are unless their guardian are with them	1
2014	3083	Unless they allow them in the area were the books, movies, magazines, etc.The kids should have a certain part of the library were they can take books from that's inappropiate for them	2
2015	3083	There's alot of books that children shouldn't be able to read but they read anyways without adults permission.And yes their some books,that's not inappropiate for the little ones and the big kids.Thing's like that is offensive toward the parents how the staff just let them read in see things like that in the parents wonder why, an how there children learning things like that	3
2016	3083	Certain things should be posted for things that kids shouldn't be able to see an read and do.And yes I have the right to say something to the staff for letting my child read, see things their not suppose to see.They know those things not appropiate for them so why would they let them watch or do or see stuff like that	4
2017	3083	My conclusion yes I think certain things that don't suppose to be were they suppose to be for young children to see.That's not right to let them see things like that	5
2018	3083	So that's why I'm writing this essay to the newspaper arguing on whats right for allowing them to see uncensored things they are not to see	6
2019	3084	Do you believe certain books should be removed from the shelf because they are offensive	0
2020	3084	From my point of view yes, because libraries are public which means they are open to any and everyone	1
2021	3084	Kids could see a photo that @MONTH1 not be appropriate for them, people of different religion could hear foul language, and it could give some libraries a bad image	2
2022	3084	I can relate to this because I have also heard some things that I am not proud of such as foul language	3
2023	3084	That effected me because when I heard it I went around people who were positive in my life saying it to them	4
2024	3084	Of course, this could effect a child in a negative way	5
2025	3084	Kids grow up to be as positive as they can, atleast thats what parents teach them and if they get hooked on things they see they will try to immitate it	6
2026	3084	From my experience it did not turn out so good because my mother believed in physical discipline	7
2027	3084	But if a child is not taught that those things have bad effects they will learn the hard way	8
2028	3084	This is a reason I wish censorship was in our local libraries	9
2029	3084	Also, people of different religion could find it offensive	10
2030	3084	We have different consumers that walk in and out of the library everyday, so when they enter they should find it peacful not the opposite	11
2031	3084	For example a muslim could walk in the library and here others listening into music with nothing but profanity	12
2032	3084	Now that person has the right to report that person who was listening to it and he can say the library has no restrictions	13
2033	3084	At times it is okay to want a book that has a few bad words but the library needs to know their limits	14
2034	3084	Then, the library has a bad image which is a big problem	15
2035	3084	When something gets a bad look sooner or later it will not be there anymore	16
2036	3084	Meaning consumers will stop going to that library and one thing could lead to another	17
2037	3084	For example when you leave the library the people that work there want you to come back and tell other people about their library	18
2038	3084	But if problems constantly happen there they will leave and tell their friends this is not a good library	19
2039	3084	Then those figures add up then finally you struck out and it's gone	20
2040	3084	Now, if they are not removed this is what can happen	21
2041	3084	Children will immitate what they see or heard, complaints will be filed on that library	22
2042	3084	If I had a problem with the restriction levels at the library I just would stop going	23
2043	3084	And if that library can not help it atleast have the courtesy to mark the sections of the library	24
2044	3084	This will make sure we will know what we are about to see and read	25
2045	3085	I beleive that certian things such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should and shouldn't be taken off of the shelf	0
2046	3085	The reason i think that  they should stay on the shelf is because it might interest some of the people that read them	1
2047	3085	If people don't like them, or they think that it is offensive, they shouldn't go to that library	2
2048	3085	I don't get offended by anything	3
2049	3085	When I am going through the library I have seen people get offended by some of the  things that they have on the shelfs	4
2050	3085	Reading things and them getting offensive is a totally different thing	5
2051	3085	People that read things and get offended by it, should have a say in whether it is on the shelf or not	6
2052	3085	The reason I think that some of the things shouldn't be on the shelf is because it might be inappropriete	7
2053	3085	It might not be good for the eyes of people	8
2054	3085	I think that all libraries should carry the same content in them	9
2055	3085	So that way noone is making a big deal about what is on the shelves.	10
2056	3088	I believe libraries should have all types of books, music, movies, and magazines	0
2057	3088	I believe if libraries had limited things that alot of people would not come to the library	1
2058	3088	For example, if I wanted to get a certain book for school and the library does not have it i don't no were else I would go	2
2059	3088	The library should have a variety of books if not what if the point of a library	3
2060	3088	Some books might be to explicit for a child to read	4
2061	3088	For music I think a library should be limited.I think music should be limited because alot of music has cursing in it	5
2062	3088	I don't think everyone wants to hear that type of music in a library	6
2063	3088	I dont think a person should be able to listen to music in the library anyways because a library is suppose to be quiet	7
2064	3088	But also people who listen to that type of music might be disappointed	8
2065	3088	Some music might be to bad for some chlidrens ears	9
2066	3088	For movies I think they should have an age limited for children	10
2067	3088	Thats simple kids should be able to only watch kid movies	11
2068	3088	Teenagers should be aloud to watch kid movies and teen movies	12
2069	3088	Adults should be able to watch all movies	13
2070	3088	That is how it should go	14
2071	3088	For magazines they should have all types of magazines	15
2072	3088	They should have them from child to adult but in different sections	16
2073	3088	For example, All the children magazines should go with the children books	17
2074	3088	All the adult magazines should be with the adult reading books	18
2075	3088	Some magzines are to explicit but the library should make sure the magazines stay in the adult section	19
2076	3088	Some books are offensive but there books and a library is there to provide books	20
2077	3088	All kind of books should be in the library no matter what in my opinion	21
2078	3088	I've never experience a nasty, or explicit book	22
2079	3088	So if anything is explicit keep it in the adults only section	23
2080	3088	Every book should be in the library	24
2081	3089	We've all heard the songs on the radio that are censored by constant beeps because of bad words, and we've all seen  @ORGANIZATION1 shows and movies that are the same way	0
2082	3089	Books and magazines are censored the same way by either blocking out the offensive language or replacing the letters with astrics	1
2083	3089	Numerous amounts of people see no harm in this and support it, while others think that it is no big deal because, eventually, people are going to end up seeing the bad things anyway	2
2084	3089	If you were an author, musician, or director, wouldn't you want your work to be seen and published as you had originally written it	3
2085	3089	Most of those people would, and get angry when their work is edited	4
2086	3089	They want their work to be heard, and sometimes editing out the disrespectful things cause the message not to be understood as clear as it would be with those certain words	5
2087	3089	This can also cause the original message to be completely missed, and the work could end up meaning something totally different then what it was originally supposed to mean	6
2088	3089	However, another question arises: If you were a parent, would you want your kids to see those inappropriate scenes in movies, or hear harsh words in music	7
2089	3089	Most would not want that at all and strongly encourage editing out things that their children are too young to hear and understand	8
2090	3089	Eventually, though, kids are going to be faced with those things	9
2091	3089	In conclusion, cenorship should just be ignored	10
2092	3089	Children are going to end up hearing bad words, seeing inappropriate things, and reading offensive passages in books or magazines	11
2093	3089	Censoring things can mess up the original message being brought to attention and anger many authors and musicians	12
2094	3089	There are loads of harsh things in the world, its impossible to just edit them all out	13
2095	3090	They were talking about thinking of a book that no one should take off the shelf	0
2096	3090	But if the author had the right to remove the book from the shelf - that work I abhor, then everyone else should have the same right to remove the book from the shelf	1
2097	3090	But then, they would have no books left on the book shelf for any of them to read	2
2098	3090	They think that they should get some books that are not found offensive	3
2099	3090	This is what they should do about books that are found offensive	4
2100	3090	If kids were reading books that the author found offensive, they should get rid of them	5
2101	3090	The books that were found offensive should not be read at all	6
2102	3090	Books that are found offensive are really bad for you to read	7
2103	3090	Offensive books should not be anywhere you are at	8
2104	3090	If you are going to read a book, do not get a book that is offensive	9
2105	3090	Non-offensive books like @CAPS1, those kinds of books are not very offensive	10
2106	3090	If books were not offensive, people would read them very often	11
2107	3090	If people were to read books very often, there would not be enough @CAPS1 to do anything else	12
2108	3090	We do not deserve offensive books that have bad things in them	13
2109	3090	People deserve to have better and not offensive books	14
2110	3090	Every day we read books, but do we know if they are offensive	15
2111	3090	If we did not know about the books we are reading were offensive, then we would be saying things right out of the book that we should not be saying	16
2112	3090	If we say stuff right out of the offensive book, we would get in severe trouble	17
2113	3090	Getting in trouble can mean some serious punishment	18
2114	3090	When you get punished, it could cause you to lose something for a certain amount of @CAPS1	19
2115	3090	In conclusion, you understand what you can and cannot read	20
2116	3090	You also understand about what to do with offensive books	21
2117	3090	That non-offensive books can make you learn something	22
2118	3090	You can also understand about what happens when you say bad things out of the offensive books	23
2119	3090	And that you can end up losing something for a certain amount of @CAPS1.	24
2120	3092	Do you think there should be any books movies madaines etc tooken off the shelfs	0
2121	3092	Will if so then you should read my newspapper actle	1
2122	3092	I don't think that there is any books etc, that i would take off the shelfs	2
2123	3092	There are many books etc that kids should read, but you can tell your kids not to read them, or if they do start to read them take the book away from them	3
2124	3092	There are some books that kids shouldn't read, but only you can stop them from reading them	4
2125	3092	They willl always try to find away to get what they want	5
2126	3092	so taking books off the shelf wouldn't do any good, because they'll find the book movie ets somehow	6
2127	3092	The only way to make such is to keep your kids over watch, and to make such they do son't the stuff you don't want them to do	7
2128	3092	In conculusion taking books off the shlef would't help anyone out, but just try to keep your kids away from the stuff you  don't want them to be around	8
2129	3093	If I owned or worked at a librarie, I would have books, music, movies and magazines that to many people are offensive	0
2130	3093	But I would not have the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines in the childrens area of the librarie.But I would have them in the adult area	1
2131	3093	@CAPS5 I would keep that type of books, music or movies might you ask	2
2132	3093	Well because the adult and older tenageers should be able to handle and act like adult when reading the book, watching the movie, listening to music	3
2133	3093	If the type of book, movie, or music is causing violent behavior around the town then i will completly remove the item from the shelf	4
2134	3093	Its that simple	5
2135	3093	If parents get mad and angree because of these books, movie, and music don't let your children watch, read, or listen to them	6
2136	3093	Pick out a childs book like @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1, don't pick out a book from @PERSON1	7
2137	3093	Let your children read a book with lots of pictures and color	8
2138	3093	Watch @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 not @CAPS3 on a @CAPS4	9
2139	3093	My questions is, '@CAPS5 not let people read and watch something that they want even if it is offensive?' @CAPS6 people love watching the scary and offensive movie or listening to the rap music	10
2140	3093	People live in defferent worlds even though we all live in one	11
2141	3093	In my oppenion offensive books, music and movies should stay in libraries	12
2142	3093	Just little and younger kids shouls not read, watch or listen to them	13
2143	3094	Books, music, movies, and much more, being removed off  of the self because no one liked them and find some of them offensive does not not mean to get rid of them	0
2144	3094	Many enjoy them, and could use them for shool research or topics for a class	1
2145	3094	First of all I know for a fact that some of the music my friends and I listen to would bother many other people, it was clearly our chioce to buy the music, book, or movie	2
2146	3094	We all have different opinions on what 'good' music or movies are	3
2147	3094	I can understand why some people would want us to get rid of it because of the foul language or racial slurs, but it is our money and our decision to buy it	4
2148	3094	Many teens take the music thing out of control and turn it up so loud that it will let @LOCATION1 hear it and with all the word and comments then make in the music I can see why adults don't want us to buy it	5
2149	3094	In respect for others I think we can turn down the radio, don't make comments to movies, and don't be immature with the books	6
2150	3094	Second, All the research and studying we have to do in school, it would be pointless to not be able to have books or magazines to do our research with	7
2151	3094	Now a days the students get to pick what they want to do a topic over and if they want to do that topic bad enough then I am pretty sure they have the material to look up the information on that subject	8
2152	3094	I do realize that it gets out of control with the music, movies, magazines, and books but we know when to settle down and grow up	9
2153	3094	Teens who are going to be immature about it does not deserve to have all those things	10
2154	3094	We just have to learn to use it with respect	11
2155	3094	Just getting them taken off the shelf would not be a good idea because some kids would actually use them for school believe it or not	12
2156	3097	I @CAPS1 would like @CAPS4 if nothing was censored, but I don't matter, right	0
2157	3097	I am the kid that has no choice in the matter	1
2158	3097	@CAPS3 should I not care about what I am forced not to see	2
2159	3097	I am sure there are alot of parents that dont follow the censorship rules	3
2160	3097	Like buying a rated '@CAPS2' movie, or game for their kid that is @NUM1, and not @NUM2 years old, but @CAPS4 does matter that the parents are following the law	4
2161	3097	I say shrew the law, because when @CAPS4 comes down to @CAPS4, its the parents right to tell/show there kid about things, not the goverment	5
2162	3097	I Think that @CAPS5 have never really had a choice in matters that affects them directly, and I think we should	6
2163	3097	@CAPS5 have to follow what ever rules untill there @NUM2 years of age: @CAPS3	7
2164	3097	I wish I knew @CAPS3, but I dont	8
2165	3097	Because there is no logical reason for @CAPS5 not to have a vote on what affects them	9
2166	3097	For all I know there could be a law out right now that is going to make my generation less powerfull then the last generation	10
2167	3097	I am not saying that this is true, I am only saying that its possible for some thing like this to happen	11
2168	3097	Video games, They are my weakness I admit, but I don't see a reason for games to be censored	12
2169	3097	When people say things like '@CAPS5 who play video games with violence will make them murders.' @CAPS4 makes me frustrated	13
2170	3097	There is not one single thing that proves that	14
2171	3097	I have known @CAPS5 who have been censored all there life, and when they learn about @CAPS4 all they cant even handle @CAPS4	15
2172	3097	Its sad really to not beable to watch the news and learn what is going on in the world	16
2173	3097	Just because they have been kept away from all that all there life	17
2174	3097	I don't know how or where they get this censorship idea from in the first place	18
2175	3097	Did their parents tell them @CAPS4 was bad, and never watch/read @CAPS4	19
2176	3097	Where did they hear @CAPS4 from	20
2177	3097	I beleive @CAPS4 came from the media @CAPS4 self	21
2178	3097	I can see the headlines now, '@CAPS5 watching @CAPS6 movie cause them to be murders.' Then they would have some made up percentage on how manny @CAPS5 turn in to a murder that watch @CAPS6 movie compare to @CAPS5 that don't	22
2179	3097	What I am really saying is that I try not to let other peoples beleifs get in my head and change my own beleifs	23
2180	3097	Even by me writing this @MONTH1 have cause someone to change there beleifs, and I really @CAPS1 hope I haven't.	24
2181	3098	Do I belive that some books, movies, magazines, or ext., shuold be removed do to the fuct some people might find them offensive	0
2182	3098	NO, I belive that every should have the chance to see it to other then the just the people how did and thought it was offensive	1
2183	3098	Someone could really like it or a group of people could.Even if some people find an object offensive someone else might need that object for something like school work	2
2184	3098	Lets say the libraries remove a human trafficking book from the libraries becuase people find it offensive	3
2185	3098	Then a local school has a praject on human trafficking	4
2186	3098	The students go to the libraries to get some books on it	5
2187	3098	Now do to somebody elses dislike of the books these kids don't get to use those books to do thier reshearch	6
2188	3098	It wouldn't be fair to everyone to remove objects from the libraries just cause some other people find it offensive	7
2189	3098	The libraries is a public place that everyone has the right to go and borrow stuff from	8
2190	3098	So no i don't belive that libraries should remove books, movies, magazines, or ext., do to the fact that some other people @MONTH1 find them offensive.	9
2191	3099	Twilight, @PERSON1, or even The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series are books that many guardians do not allow their children to read due to their beliefs on what is real and what is not	0
2192	3099	Magic, spells, and vampires many of us know are not real but others do not believe in what it is that is being taught to the younger readers	1
2193	3099	My personal view on censorship would be a very low tolerable standard due to different people, more variety, and different reading or viewing materials	2
2194	3099	But there would be certain circumstances where I would have to put my foot down and censor things such as sex and drugs just because that is not suitable for young children to be reading at that young of age	3
2195	3099	The reason why I would have a low tolerance of the censorship is because different people like different things	4
2196	3099	If someone was an athelte they might not find a book about cooking and cleaning very appealing	5
2197	3099	As if a person that was a cook might not find a book about athletics too appealing either	6
2198	3099	Just because one person has different beliefs or what their standard is for offensive would not change my stand point on the censorship of certain articles	7
2199	3099	Different beliefs of certain people is understandle but, just because you don't believe it doesn't mean that everyone else is going to right there not believing it with you	8
2200	3099	Dont't ruin it for the others who enjoy the interesting fact of a male @CAPS1 falling in love with a normal @CAPS3 girl just like you and me	9
2201	3099	Another reason why my censorship in libraries is because it would give my library more variety	10
2202	3099	If there was twenty different @PERSON1 books on the shelves many people would be able to look at them and check them out as they please	11
2203	3099	Also, if you didn't know what kind of book you wanted to check out, you could look around and get a mystery, drama, comical, or even a horror book	12
2204	3099	Having a wide range to select from would keep the guests always coming back for more	13
2205	3099	I know that when my library had a series of books that I found interesting that I was back in there after I finished each one	14
2206	3099	Also, having different reading or viewing materials on hand is important in a library do to the fact that some books these days are now turned into films which makes people more eager to finish that book in less then a week so that weekend they can watch the movie	15
2207	3099	Most people say that the movies are never better then the original book itself but an opinion is easier to be based off of reading the book and then watching the movie not just by stopping after reading the book	16
2208	3099	Now that you know my personal views about the censorship in libraries understand that not everyone is the same	17
2209	3099	That is why when school's talk about getting school uniforms many children are against it due to the fact of wearing whatever style of clothing you do each day show individuality such as which type of book your reading also, shows your individuality	18
2210	3099	That is why my personal view on censorship would be a very low tolerable standard due to the fact that different people, more variety, and different reading or viewing materials	19
2211	3099	Just because you @MONTH1 not believe in the magic or wizardry doesn't mean you have to ruin it for someone else	20
2212	3099	So don't jusdge a book by it's cover and lets not set a high standard on censorship in libraries.	21
2213	3100	I strongly disagree.I think that materials should don't  be removed from the library.@CAPS1 all the materials are part of the library and for the school and for us too.All the materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, cd's	0
2214	3100	should don't be removed from the library.I got my own reasons that materials should don't be remove from the shelf	1
2215	3100	like sometimes i don't found any interesting things to do, so i go to my tiny library that i got in my house and i pick any book that i like.But when i don't like or i don't find any interesting book in my house, i go to the library to find  some intresting  books.But when the libraries or the school got offensive books, magazines, movies, ect., i think that offensive stuff shoul be remove from the library,@CAPS1 is not good for the children's, like when they want to read a book, like cartoon or animal book, and they don't find what they want they are going to get mad	2
2216	3100	And what about the parents the parents if they need to found some information about a book, or they just wanted to read and they found offensive stuff, the parents are going to get mad, not all the parents right but some parent will.and they maybe are not going to came back again.I never experience something like this in my life @CAPS1 in my school and the library that i go they don't have anything offensive or inapropiated	3
2217	3100	that's why a respect the people for the library and for the school, @CAPS1 they respec us too	4
2218	3100	tha's why i never go to places that i don't know.Supose i go to a library that i don't know and i bring my parent and my little brother right and this library have offensive materials, my parents are going to get mad with me, they are going to said that if i don't have respec, and that i bring my brother to a innapropiated place they are going to be mad with me, that i bring my family to a offensive place, and is not my foul right.And those are my opinions why	5
2219	3101	No, i do not think that books, magizines, movies and music should be removed	0
2220	3101	However, I do think that the books, magizines, movies, and music should be monitred by age	1
2221	3101	The reason why is because younger children sould not be reading , listening, or watching material that is for adults or teenagers	2
2222	3101	They way these type of things can be monitred is by the child's library card	3
2223	3101	The card could have their name, age, grade, and date of birth	4
2224	3101	If there is a certain book, magizine, movie, and music that the child want a parent has to be there with them	5
2225	3101	The parent needs to show a form of identification so that the librian knows that the parent  is of age	6
2226	3101	Teenagers should also be moniterd	7
2227	3101	Event though they are almost adults	8
2228	3101	Some parents @MONTH1 not agree with some of the material	9
2229	3101	So, if their parents does not want them reading certain things their should be stickers on their cards	10
2230	3101	Even though there are plenty of opinions about what a persons child is reading , watching, or listening to I think there should be certain ways to watch what children are reading, watching or listening to	11
2231	3102	Picture yourself walking through the library with your child	0
2232	3102	Now think of how hard you worked to teach your child respect and manners	1
2233	3102	Imagine all of those values going down the drain by them reading one bad magazine or listening to one explicit song	2
2234	3102	I agree with the censorship in libraries today	3
2235	3102	Most people wonder where their children learn curse words or sexual behavior and do not consider media as the problem	4
2236	3102	Libraries have continued to keep children areas clean of explicit materials and are careful so that magazines such as '@CAPS1' do not reach their shelves	5
2237	3102	Explicit material should be removed if it is found offensive	6
2238	3102	I have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids	7
2239	3102	That childish innocence disappears when they hear songs about money, sex, and abuse	8
2240	3102	Some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions	9
2241	3102	One example is a teen pregnancy book	10
2242	3102	The ideas in the book are either to keep the baby and deal with the consquences or abort the baby and move on with life	11
2243	3102	Some media says to abort the baby just because it is easier	12
2244	3102	Would you want your child to have the idea in their head that they should react first before they think	13
2245	3102	In conclusion, censorship should be kept in libraries	14
2246	3102	It helps everyone altogether not to worry about what wrong things their kids are doing, or how they snatched the wrong idea	15
2247	3102	Please help us promote censorship in libraries to make a more respectful environment.	16
2248	3103	I feel as we are letting kids these days do as they feel, and do what ever they want	0
2249	3103	We are making them think that we don't care what they are involved in, but thats not true	1
2250	3103	We need to set boundries for what kids should and shouldn't be able to do	2
2251	3103	We need to show them that we know what they doing	3
2252	3103	I think that there should be an age policy for libraries	4
2253	3103	If there are any books that have any types of adult content, they should be in the adult section	5
2254	3103	If you ever wanted to check out books, movies, or magazines from that section you would have to be eighteen or older	6
2255	3103	If that was to much to ask for then you should at least have the parents sign a concent form	7
2256	3103	Book, movies, and magiznes with any type of adult content can be harzardess to child, whether its through their actions or behaviors	8
2257	3103	It @MONTH1 effect their lives depending on what age they were introduced to such things	9
2258	3103	We need to show them that we care	10
2259	3103	I know from personal experiences that being exposed to this, drasticly changes people, not over time but quickly	11
2260	3103	Now a days the media is portarying that money, alcohal, fame, and drugs are good things	12
2261	3103	This is what we are putting into our movies and books and magazines, and putting into the children of @CAPS1 heads	13
2262	3103	We are telling them that its ok, but its most certanly not	14
2263	3103	These are all the reasons why we should put cencorships and restrictions on libraries	15
2264	3103	We are letting the children of @CAPS2 grow up to fast and introducing them to things way to early	16
2265	3103	In a way we are brain washing them on how to live a destructive live, through adult oriented things	17
2266	3104	The media is destroying our youth	0
2267	3104	this is something we hear everyday	1
2268	3104	Teachers are telling us this, while parents and grandparents are telling us how mush different their world used to be	2
2269	3104	They explain how the media of their time wasn't as open about sex and violence	3
2270	3104	They go on to say how they didn't have violent video games teaching children that killing is alright	4
2271	3104	Because of these people, we think that the media is repsonsible for the wrong in the world of @DATE1	5
2272	3104	The truth is that it isn't the medias fault, it is the parents	6
2273	3104	It is the parents responsiblity to teach the children of the world the difference between right and wrong	7
2274	3104	If these such parent do their jobs correctly then the youth of @DATE1 will not need for everything to be censored	8
2275	3104	It is my firm belief that their should not be any censorships	9
2276	3104	When their is censorship people can govern what we learn, destroy what goes agiainst their beliefs, and destroy our god given right to freedom of speech    Censorship will detroy the knowlege available @DATE1	10
2277	3104	We have had seen censorship in our history	11
2278	3104	When we look back we see that the @ORGANIZATION1's censored and destroyed anything that went against them	12
2279	3104	We hated it when they had book burnings and destroyed the custums, art, and music that the government felt was wrong for their people	13
2280	3104	How would we be any different if we did it	14
2281	3104	We could potentailly be destroying somones way of life	15
2282	3104	We would be destroying what could possibly be tomorrows masterpeice	16
2283	3104	In censoring we would be detroying history.By destroying history we would be detroying the brilliance that is learning	17
2284	3104	If we allow censorship anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed	18
2285	3104	If you ask any christian if they would allow their children to read the muslim book of faith, the @LOCATION1, they would tell you no	19
2286	3104	It would be the same if you asked a muslim if they would let their children read the @CAPS1	20
2287	3104	The point is that if their is cansorship we would be destroying other peoples beliefs	21
2288	3104	No one has the right to govern what others believe in the world	22
2289	3104	Also in censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves	23
2290	3104	If we don't allow peole to read what someone else has written because we believe it is wrong, then we are taking away their ability to learn new ideas because everyone has different opinionsand theories	24
2291	3104	Every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same thing	25
2292	3104	No one would want to read them because they would already know what they would hav eto say	26
2293	3104	When we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech we will not be able to stop those people who took those right from taking more	27
2294	3104	Of course their will always be things in the media, in books, and in music that we don't like.Their will be cursing, nudity, and violence everywhere we turn	28
2295	3104	This is not because we want it there, but because these things are a part of life	29
2296	3104	They are the dark parts that we dont want to see	30
2297	3104	If you dont want to see dont look	31
2298	3104	Just dont close everyone elses eyes because you dont like what you see	32
2299	3104	Our learning, our beliefs, and our freedom of speech are too important to just give up to censorship	33
2300	3104	We cannot alow others to dictate, in this matter, what is right for us	34
2301	3104	Our media is too intertwined with our lives	35
2302	3104	Who's right is it to decide what is right for our lives	36
2303	3104	If we start giving up these small freedoms then those taking them from us will not stop	37
2304	3104	They will just keep taking what freedoms we have until we are nothing more that a dictatorship	38
2305	3105	Censorship in libraries should not be a big deal	0
2306	3105	There are materials in libraries that are found to be offensive to some people	1
2307	3105	To solve the problem, everything should not be censored	2
2308	3105	Why can't those that find it offensive just steer clear of it	3
2309	3105	I believe it should be a persons choice to read something or not and if they find it offensive, they should simply put it down	4
2310	3105	The book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' has offended many people	5
2311	3105	I have read it and was not offended	6
2312	3105	I found it very interesting and educational	7
2313	3105	Many people think the book should be censored	8
2314	3105	But if it is censored, the story would completely change and it would not be the same	9
2315	3105	I would have learned nothing instead of learning how people lived in @LOCATION1's history	10
2316	3105	If all the books and magazines that were offensive to one person were taken off the shelves, and all the books offensive to another taken away, what would be left	11
2317	3105	Little kids books about kittens	12
2318	3105	Well that's just lovely	13
2319	3105	I am very much against censorship	14
2320	3105	I believe that if a material is offensive to you, then you shouldn't read it or listen to it	15
2321	3105	But don't ruin it for the rest of us	16
2322	3106	The library is a place of learning, discovery, and knowledge, available to anyone willing to take the time to engross themselves in the rows and rows of information	0
2323	3106	Including children's books, novels for young adults, @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2, music, and movies, the library gives us a magnitude of opportunities to discover something we didn't know before	1
2324	3106	Although, there are other things that can be found in the library as well	2
2325	3106	Books including racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments can accidentally be stumbled upon while searching for something else	3
2326	3106	A parent should not have to worry about their child coming across a book or magazine containing inappropriate things such as this	4
2327	3106	I believe that offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of our libraries	5
2328	3106	I would like to being by saying that I have an extreme issue with books that include comments, remarks, or names referring to people of a certain race	6
2329	3106	Imagine if an @CAPS1 @CAPS2 woman brought her daughter of @NUM1 years into the library to find information about a school project	7
2330	3106	Instead of finding the birth date of @PERSON1, she found a book making fun of @CAPS1 @CAPS4 and calling them inappropriate names	8
2331	3106	Children should not have to come across a discovery like that in a public facility, where fun and interesting facts should be found	9
2332	3106	not racial slurs	10
2333	3106	This type of event could cause serious damage on a child emotionally and mentally	11
2334	3106	That is why these types of things should be taken off the shelves immediately	12
2335	3106	Another issue I have is with sexual content being found in libraries	13
2336	3106	I do understand that several books contain some sort of sexual content, but I am speaking of a novel describing a sex scene in extreme detail, or images of almost naked women on the cover	14
2337	3106	If someone is searching for a book of that kind, they can travel to a sex store somewhere nearby and get their fix of sexual reading pleasure	15
2338	3106	That type of book, however, should not be found in the library	16
2339	3106	It makes our society look bad and taints our places of knowledge	17
2340	3106	Lastly, I would like to express how I feel about offensive religious comments being found in libraries	18
2341	3106	Every human in the @LOCATION1 is entitled to their own choice of religion	19
2342	3106	They @MONTH1 practice it freely, which is sadly not the case for others in different countries	20
2343	3106	If we have an uncommom right such as freedom of religion, then why would we put books in our libraries that include rude comments towards different religions	21
2344	3106	A @CAPS5 woman should not have to go to a library and come across a book stating her religion is an waste and stupid	22
2345	3106	This is not the truth, and it should not be in our libraries	23
2346	3106	Even though I feel this way about inappropriate books, I understand there has to be some sort of limit when it comes to censorship	24
2347	3106	Many people fear once we start removing certain books from libraries, more and more books will be taken from the public until almost all our libraries are empty	25
2348	3106	Yes, if we do not censor within certain limits, this could happen	26
2349	3106	This is not what I want to happen though	27
2350	3106	I simply want the people of this community to stop and consider what is easily available for our children to obtain	28
2351	3106	The least we can do, as parents, is to take books, movies, magazines, and music containing racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments out of the libraries	29
2352	3107	Two of the many privaleges that we have as @CAPS1 are freedom of speech and freedom of expression	0
2353	3107	Although some bodies of work @MONTH1 be percieved as offensive or inappropriate, I believe that they should still be available to the public	1
2354	3107	Some might agree with the topic being expressed, even if it is offensive or inappropriate, and others @MONTH1 not	2
2355	3107	but they should not be removed from libraries because of their negativity	3
2356	3107	These offensive or harsh pieces of literature could even be used to show the public what is considered rude, offensive, or inappropriate, and should be thought of as learning tools instead of being banned	4
2357	3107	Every person has a right to an opinion, and others @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree with what that person has to say, but it does not change the fact that they have the right to their beliefs	5
2358	3107	Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self'	6
2359	3107	I myself have read literature that is considered offensive, but as disturbing as the literature was, I am glad that I was educated on what people thought was acceptable behavior so that I know, and can teach others that despite what the book said, we now know that it was describing how people should not be living	7
2360	3107	I believe that it would be a grave mistake to remove these materials from the public eye, because many are ingorant to the historical beliefs of others that have affected our nation and other countries across the globe	8
2361	3107	All of these books are educational, though some are harsh, and they should be used to show what is right and wrong	9
2362	3107	If they are taken off of shelves in the libraries then people, especially children could start to think that a certain idea, that @MONTH1 be incorrect or offensive, is completely appropriate and acceptable	10
2363	3107	As someone once said, '@CAPS2 who do not know their history are bound to repeat it'	11
2364	3107	By removing the problem, we would be creating another issue	12
2365	3107	For example, many books have been written over history that convey hatred and discrimination towards other cultures, ethnicities, religions, and lifestyles	13
2366	3107	If @CAPS2 works of literature were banned and not available to the public, many people would not know that it is wrong to show hatred towards others just because they are different than you	14
2367	3107	This type of literature provides usefull information: it allows people to see how a large amount of people thought life should have been years ago, and they taught the people of @DATE1 that it actually was how people should not be living.	15
2368	3108	Libraries are known as places where a person can go to find material on almost any topic they could want to learn about, whether that material is a book, movie, or magazine	0
2369	3108	Anyone can use the library, and it is a valuable resource to many people	1
2370	3108	So why do some libraries insist on removing some of those valuable materials from their shelves	2
2371	3108	In past years, censorship in libraries has been the focus of many news reports	3
2372	3108	In almost all cases, library patrons have been angry that certain materials have been deemed unsuitable to be offered at the library	4
2373	3108	I have to say that I agree with them	5
2374	3108	People have a right to choose what books they want to read, what movies they want to watch, and what music they want to listen to	6
2375	3108	People have opinions	7
2376	3108	people disagree	8
2377	3108	What one person loves, another person could hate	9
2378	3108	But just because one person dislikes or is offended by a material on a library shelf does not mean that the opportunity to use that material should be denied to all other patrons	10
2379	3108	I feel that if a resource is checked out by just one individual, and that one individual is able to learn from or enjoy the resource, then the library has achieved its purpose and helped the community by offering that material	11
2380	3108	In conclusion, censorship in libraries is limiting and wrong	12
2381	3108	It creates barriers for those who want to learn and it takes away people's freedom to make decisions for themselves	13
2382	3108	Everyone should be able to decide whether to pick up a library material, and censorship makes that impossible	14
2383	3109	Katherine Paterson stated this quote, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf,' @CAPS1 I agree 	0
2384	3109	I feel that some of the books we have in our @ORGANIZATION1 libraries today just shouldn't be there	1
2385	3109	Offensive books, music, movies, and magazines can give  students and young children the wrong impact on life or their envoirment around them	2
2386	3109	Now days, what children see is sometime what they do, so if books, music, movies, and magazines give them the idea that what they say or do is cool, then kids will most likely do it	3
2387	3109	@CAPS2 observation when i look at kids  in @CAPS2 community playing  is that they follow one another 	4
2388	3109	When their playing tag and hide an go seek , So movies, books , music, and magazines play a big part on the way they behave	5
2389	3109	@CAPS2 own experience with offensive books would be, there are books that are made by @PERSON3	6
2390	3109	In these books they use curel language, use wonmen bodyparts as symbols and many more rude things	7
2391	3109	@CAPS2 little sister came across one of these books, when she ask me about it was hard for me to explain to her that this was no book for a child her age to be reading, So the best way for me to put it was that it was an adult book	8
2392	3109	For her to get any images out of her head that I felt she shound't have	9
2393	3109	Another experience I've saw was with @CAPS2 little cousin @PERSON2	10
2394	3109	He was looking at a magazine out of @ORGANIZATION1 library	11
2395	3109	The magazine was offensive to wonmen	12
2396	3109	It was a play boy bunny magazine	13
2397	3109	Now I don't know if you ever heard of these magazine , but I think it is very wrong that they use wonmen bodys for men to view 	14
2398	3109	I also feel that  those type of magazines should not be in a @ORGANIZATION1 library	15
2399	3109	I believe it gives children, mainly  young men the wrong thoughts about wonmen	16
2400	3109	@CAPS2 overall thoughts on censorship in libraries, is that not eveyone is going to feel the same way I do 	17
2401	3109	There are parents that allow their children to read, listen , and watch whatever they want	18
2402	3109	I'm here to say i don't feel that is the way to go about things , because it can influence your children to do inappropriate things 	19
2403	3109	I hope you take with you, @CAPS2 personal experience with you and help you children read , listen , and watch age appropriate books , music , moives , and magazines	20
2404	3110	Do I think that certain materials such asd books, music, movies,magazines,etc., should be removed froom libraries, no, because people might need to know a certain information, certain lessons are taught in different sources, all sources are liabilities	0
2405	3110	Now, you just @MONTH1 need certain information, and in those sources there are an unnumbered amount of lessons to learn	1
2406	3110	For example if were to go in a library an need a book on religion I would need a book or movie to teech me on that particular subject, or even sex I would need a magazine or move to watch to know new information	2
2407	3110	There are different lessons taght in different aspects	3
2408	3110	For example some people learn by example, movies, music, and magzines	4
2409	3110	I it were to be me lokking for a source on music theory I might need one of those things to get what i need	5
2410	3110	Finally, those things are liabillities	6
2411	3110	Don't get me wrong like we need them on a daily bases, but in a sense we sort of do	7
2412	3110	We use search engines for everything, everyday	8
2413	3110	so what do you think	9
2414	3110	In conclusion i believe we need those sources because, someone @MONTH1 need certain information, there are diffferent lessons learned and taught in different things, a lastly ALL sources are liabillities	10
2415	3111	The right to remove a book off of a shelf is not good thing to do	0
2416	3111	My view on the subject is that, if this begins there will only empty shelfs in librarys across the country	1
2417	3111	Once the removing of books start there will be hardly any left	2
2418	3111	We use books everyday, for students we use them to learn and for a entertainment during someclasses	3
2419	3111	Books help us learn things, like new words we've never heard of before, or some major point in history we should know about	4
2420	3111	Even as adults some of them like to read in there free time	5
2421	3111	I think its wrong to remove a book off of the shelf, just because a few or a bunch of people think its inaproprate	6
2422	3111	If it is the librarys should have section for those books that dont let the little kids go in that section	7
2423	3111	their is a problem for this idea, what books should go into this section of the library	8
2424	3111	A way to solve that question would be to elect a nation wide library service to set it up and have people vote on which books to to remove or put into a speacial section in the librarys across the nation	9
2425	3111	This idea goes the same for everything found at a library	10
2426	3111	Another soulution to this matter is that, the librarys across the nation have another labeling system like the dewey decimal system but use both	11
2427	3111	this new system could contain information like reviews from crtics about the book, or what happend during the book	12
2428	3111	This would inform the reader more on what he is about to engrossed in for the next week or so	13
2429	3111	The books, music, magazines found in librarys should be left their for a reason	14
2430	3111	Sombody wrote, or composed for a reason	15
2431	3111	so people like you and me can enjoy good stories in books and read informing magazines ad listen to good music	16
2432	3112	Libraries should never remove any material just because it @MONTH1 be found offensive	0
2433	3112	Something that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be to another	1
2434	3112	If the material was so offensive that it went against the law, then it probably wouldn't have been published in the first place	2
2435	3112	People often get offended if they read, see, or listen to something that goes against their personal views, ethics, or religion	3
2436	3112	But people need to learn to understand that other people think differently and have different values	4
2437	3112	Though peoples' opinions differ, each opinion is equally important to that certain person	5
2438	3112	So many media sources today are censored that it is essential to keep a place where people can freely obtain material and express opinions	6
2439	3112	As a student I often have a hard time finding meaningful literature in the school library because it is so censored	7
2440	3112	I am not complaining about this because I understand that schools have to be careful of what they are exposing students to	8
2441	3112	But if I am looking for something maybe more religious, derogoratory, or less accepted, it is nice to have a public library where I can find these things	9
2442	3112	In closing, if people are offended by something on the shelves of a library then they shouldn't read, watch, or listen to it	10
2443	3112	But do not censor everything so that people who do enjoy these materials can no longer easily access them	11
2444	3113	I dont believe books should be takin off of the shelves for being offensive	0
2445	3113	Some books that are found offensive by one person might not offend another	1
2446	3113	People @MONTH1 have the right to say that a book is offensive if that is how they feel, but they do not have the right to deny others the right to read that book	2
2447	3113	I understand that parents want to protect children	3
2448	3113	Parents should talk to their children and explain to them why they dont want them reading that specific book	4
2449	3113	Parents might also just let their children read it and explain why they don't approve	5
2450	3113	I feel the same way about the censorship of music and movies	6
2451	3113	When I was twelve years old i started to listen to music that I enjoyed instead of the music my mother played	7
2452	3113	My mother was concerned about the lyrical content of the songs i would listen to	8
2453	3113	She refused to buy me the music and would not let me listen to it	9
2454	3113	I went to my friends houses and listed to explicit music and watched rated @CAPS1 movies	10
2455	3113	She could never really stop me because that explicit language was being said wherever I went	11
2456	3113	I think instead of trying to deny teenagers the music the parents should explain why and let them make the decision	12
2457	3113	I think censorship should be left up to the parents of that child	13
2458	3113	Sometimes when parents try to pull their kids closer they actually push them away	14
2459	3113	That's why I think it's so important for the parent and the child to always talk and be comfortable	15
2460	3114	Many people go to libraries	0
2461	3114	such as children, parents, and grandparents	1
2462	3114	I have come to realize that their purpose for going to this community loving place is to find peace and quiet	2
2463	3114	Some don't even go there for the books	3
2464	3114	They will engage in music, magazine, enjoy a cup of coffee, or simply get on the internet	4
2465	3114	Now some people argue that some of the books, music, and movies in libraries are inappropriate or offensive, but does that mean the libraries should have to get rid of them	5
2466	3114	These materials people find offensive have no reason to be banned	6
2467	3114	First of all, the libraries will lose customers	7
2468	3114	There is a majority of people in the world who really like listening to rap or @CAPS1&@CAPS2	8
2469	3114	It's hard to find that kind of music without cuss words or sexual inuendo	9
2470	3114	Even I will listen to that type of stuff occasionally just so that I can have a cool beat stuck in my head for a while	10
2471	3114	Plus, when you are in a library and listening to music you will have head phones on, which isn't disruptive to other in or around the library	11
2472	3114	Secondly, customers who don't like the context of these materials don't have to get them	12
2473	3114	If there is a book that has a sex scene or talks about drugs then don't read it	13
2474	3114	You have a choice to what book you would like to read and if that isn't your style then there are plenty of other aisles and children books you can look through	14
2475	3114	Those who are interested in those topics still deserve to be able to choose those books	15
2476	3114	I have been to my public library many atimes and all the times I have been there I have not once even seen a book, music, or a movie that looks displeasing to the eyes	16
2477	3114	So if you're a person who wants an offensive book, then it takes A @CAPS3 of looking, not just a quick little scan	17
2478	3114	Finally, freedom	18
2479	3114	Isn't that was @CAPS4 is all about	19
2480	3114	The freedom of speech, and religion, and even what type of movies you want to watch	20
2481	3114	I know this might come as a shocker, but there are labels on the back of movies that tell whether it is @CAPS5, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1@NUM1, or @CAPS1	21
2482	3114	It also includes the not-so-nice content that will be present in the movie	22
2483	3114	So you have total freedom to purchase(check out) any of those rated movies	23
2484	3114	Like I explained clearly earlier, you aren't forced to watch any of the naughtier movies, so just pick what you want and be happy	24
2485	3114	As you can see, there is absolutely no reason to remove offensive books, music, or movies	25
2486	3114	There are many different types and styles of these categories and it isn't disturbing anyone	26
2487	3114	Libraries will lose customers, people dont have to choose the less appropriate things, and us @CAPS7 have freedom to do what we please, especially with what we would like to read, listen to, or watch	27
2488	3114	So save youself some time and just keep the few so called 'offensive' materials.	28
2489	3115	There are many people that think certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and should be taken off the shelves at libraries	0
2490	3115	If you had to do a project on a subject that was offensive to certain people and there was no information on it wouldn't you be a little upset	1
2491	3115	If you found somethings that are offensive interesting you should be able to go to your local library and read a book about it, and if you like to listen to offensive kind of music then you should be able to just turn the radio on and listen to it and not have to worry about those kinds of things getting removed	2
2492	3115	Some people are assigned projects for either their job or for school work	3
2493	3115	If the subject of your project was offensive to a certain race or person you would want there to be books or any other kind of information on the shelf at your local library so you could work on it	4
2494	3115	If all of the offensive books got removed from the shelves at libraries then nobody could be getting there work done	5
2495	3115	Some people find some offensive subjects interesting	6
2496	3115	For example, if someone found the @PERSON1 interesting they @MONTH1 want to just do some research to learn more about it	7
2497	3115	If the books and magazines all disappeared from the shelves about this subject then those people would not be able to learn more about those kinds of subjects	8
2498	3115	There are a lot of people that think most of the music that you hear on the radio today is offensive	9
2499	3115	If they got rid of all of that kind of music then there would probably not be a lot of music left to listen to, and a lot of people would be very mad	10
2500	3115	Also, if they got rid of all of those types of music then the writers of those songs would not be able to make any money and would be out of a job	11
2501	3115	I think that the people who think these kinds of things are offensive should just stay away from these things and stop complaining	12
2502	3115	All of the people who do not take these things offensively will be glad that they are not removings books, magazines, music, etc	13
2503	3115	I hope you take into consideration not removing these types of things from libraries and anywhere else	14
2504	3116	I think that if there are books, music @CAPS1, movies, or magazines that we should have a right to take it off the shelf if its offensive	0
2505	3116	The reason why I think this is, because I have a baby girl who I don't want to see that kind of stuff	1
2506	3116	I don't want her listening or watching movies or reading anything offensive or vulgar	2
2507	3116	I know this is a free country and everyone has the right to have their own opinions	3
2508	3116	The libraries are paid by tax payers dollars and if we take the offensive to vuglar movies, books, music and magazines then they should come off the shelf	4
2509	3116	Kids can read or see or listen the these vulgar things an think its ok or cool to say or do these things	5
2510	3116	They can see bad pictures, nudity, drugs and violence	6
2511	3116	They can see the different types of drugs and learn about them	7
2512	3116	For example pictures of weed, cocaine or pills are in books	8
2513	3116	The kids can look at this stuff and see violence	9
2514	3116	For example they can see pictures of  men hitting women or kids killing kids and this sets a bad example	10
2515	3116	We live in a world where people are influenced by the things they read, watch, and listen to	11
2516	3116	It is important that people are aware of what their children are seeing	12
2517	3116	The library is a place where many people go to learn	13
2518	3116	It is important that only people are allowed to see material that is appropriate for them	14
2519	3117	Going into a  @CAPS1 everyone has there own opinons as to what they should see on the shelfs, and what should be put out on the shelfs for everyone to see including children of all ages	0
2520	3117	Some people @MONTH1 agree that there should only be thnigs that is age appropiate for everyone, others disagree	1
2521	3117	In my opinion when im looking at this topic, i think that there should be books for everyone to read no matter what the age group, but there should also be a kid section	2
2522	3117	If parents are so concernced about what types of books their children might see at a library then they could just put them in the children section to view those	3
2523	3117	There is no reason in the world that there should not be able to be a variety types of books out	4
2524	3117	When it comes to looking at magazines, movies, and music i still have the same opinion to a certain aspect	5
2525	3117	There should be able to be all types of music out on the shelfs, because its not like people can listen to it by looking at the @CAPS2	6
2526	3117	But my opinion on the magazines, and movies could vary	7
2527	3117	There is a certain extant for movies, and magazines	8
2528	3117	I think they should all be aloud on the shelfs, minus any pornography	9
2529	3117	The reason i think like this is because, kids should not have that big of an affect on what they place on the shelfs at a library	10
2530	3117	Parents just need to be responsible and look for what their children are looking at , and pay attention to them	11
2531	3117	But when it does come to the pornography that should not be exposed in a public place such as a library	12
2532	3117	There is some where to draw the line, in any situation and thats where i think it should be drawn at a library.	13
2533	3119	There are more than six billion people in the world	0
2534	3119	That means there are over six billion different personalities and opinons of all these distinct people	1
2535	3119	It would be virtually impossible to remove all aspects of media that could be found offensive, because almost everyone is offended by something	2
2536	3119	Some media can be found more offensive than others, but its likely that its something that the author feels passionate about and the author could be offended if his opinon was rejected	3
2537	3119	Now that the internet is accessible in almost all places in the world	4
2538	3119	Media that used to only be found on the shelves is now displayed online, which can never be permanently removed from public view	5
2539	3119	It's illogical to think that just removing materials from libraries would prevent different groups of people from being offended by the media	6
2540	3119	There is a big difference between awareness and offensiveness	7
2541	3119	Some books and magazines might just have the intent to explain a type a culture and raise awareness about the subject	8
2542	3119	However, there is a definite line that reaches over to offensiveness that can easily be crossed by authors across the globe	9
2543	3119	So, it is in those authors best interest to take into account the people they are writing about	10
2544	3119	It's important to avoid stereotypes because those can be hurtful	11
2545	3119	There is already plenty of offensive literature in the world and to find it all and restrict all of it would just be irrational	12
2546	3119	If a person is offended by something someone wrote, they should just avoid reading it	13
2547	3119	However, this does not give authors the power to target a group in their writing and offend them specifically	14
2548	3119	This is a very two-sided subject	15
2549	3119	It can not strictly be controlled by censoring libraries	16
2550	3119	it is also in the hands of authors and readers everywhere	17
2551	3119	Authors and media producers should take other people into consideration and put their efforts into raising awareness instead of offending	18
2552	3119	In regards to this, readers across the globe should keep in mind why the author might target them, and avoid conflict by avoiding the material	19
2553	3119	It is not right by any means to target and offend a group of people in a piece of literature	20
2554	3119	however, this is a practice that has been done before and just remvoing the materials from the shelves won't stop it from being exploited	21
2555	3119	Libraries are already decreasing severly in their reveleance in the world	22
2556	3119	All the new technology has hurt them and its not likely that they will ever become more prominent than other reasources, like the internet, again.With this in mind, how much would censoring libraries really help those offended groups in the world	23
2557	3119	Most likely, they would not even notice a change	24
2558	3119	Everyone has the right to have an opinon and share it, but it is important to keep the feelings of others in mind as well	25
2559	3119	The world is overflowing with different media that many people have access to, so writers and producers need to think outside of themselves before putting it on the shelves.	26
2560	3120	What is offensive to you	0
2561	3120	See your answer might be different from the person sitting right next to you	1
2562	3120	There are so many materials in the world that are found to be offensive	2
2563	3120	The world wouldnt be any different if we were to pull all of these offensive materials off the shelves	3
2564	3120	There wouldnt be anything left because everyone has their own opinion about something and everyone has different inferences about what's offesive to them	4
2565	3120	I believe that offensive material shouldn't be removed from the shelve	5
2566	3120	Everything would be off the shelf if we were to pull offensive materials off the shelf	6
2567	3120	There is always something wrong with something	7
2568	3120	@CAPS1 might be the way someone has said something or the way they mean't @CAPS1 by	8
2569	3120	There is always that one person out of the bunch who has something negative to say	9
2570	3120	Either they take @CAPS1 the wrong way or they just think @CAPS1's wrong	10
2571	3120	Everyone has their own opinon about everything	11
2572	3120	Same for when some one asks you whats offensive to you	12
2573	3120	Someone else @MONTH1 say that what you find offensive, is no where near offensive to them	13
2574	3120	For instance, my grandpa loves all type of music and his life revolves aroud music	14
2575	3120	My grandma doesnt like some of his music because she says ' @CAPS1 doesn't sit right with me,' meaning that she doesn't believe in some things that the music is trying to persuade people to do	15
2576	3120	My grandpa really doesn't pay attention to the lyrics as much as my grandma does, because he doesn't see music in that kind of way	16
2577	3120	My grandpa likes a lot of music because of their rhythm and beat	17
2578	3120	They always kind of get into disagreements about music they want to listen to because my grandma finds something in the music thats offensive to her beliefs, but my grandpa doesn't	18
2579	3120	@CAPS1 doesnt effect him as much as her	19
2580	3120	If you were to go around and ask people whats offensive to them, their would be some many different answers and you could never sum @CAPS1 all down to one answer	20
2581	3120	With only a couple of people feeling offensive to some things, but the majority find @CAPS1 different, that would ruin @CAPS1 for everyone almost	21
2582	3120	Then that would almost be everything gone cause @CAPS1's always that one person that takes @CAPS1 the wrong way and has to feel offended	22
2583	3120	So I still believe that offensive materials shouldn't be pulled off shelves.	23
2584	3121	I, personally, do not think that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves because they are found offensive	0
2585	3121	However, I do believe that there should be a way to protect adolescent, still-developing children from reading books that @MONTH1 offend them or introduce them to new concepts or ideas that @MONTH1 hinder their educational growth	1
2586	3121	Some kids who have not been properly educated over a controvercial topic (such as drugs or alcohol) @MONTH1 make a bad decision based off something he or she reads about in a book or on a webpage	2
2587	3121	To help solve the problem of offending children or deterring their education, I propose that we make a book 'rating' system	3
2588	3121	Similar to rating a movie or a video game, this system would rate the book so that readers know what age level the book is apropriate for, and state what factors the book incorporates to rate it the way they did	4
2589	3121	As a newpaper company, you obviously know about our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2	5
2590	3121	We, as @CAPS3, have @CAPS2	6
2591	3121	One of them being freedom of speech, along with freedom of press	7
2592	3121	With that said, I do not think that taking books labeled as 'inappropriate' off the shelves is a reasonable solution to the issue	8
2593	3121	I know, that from personal experience, when someone tries to take away my @CAPS2 that I'm entitled to, I get extremely angry	9
2594	3121	Authors, editors, photographers, and publishers all go through a lot of hard work and long hours to put these books on the shelves	10
2595	3121	By taking the books off the shelves, I believe that that would be repressing their @CAPS2 as @CAPS3	11
2596	3121	I know that if I were an author, and my book were taken off the shelf, because someone found it 'inapppropriate' I would be very upset	12
2597	3121	Taking books off the shelves could possibly cause an author's strike, to protest until their books are allowed to be enjoyed by anyone who wishes to read them	13
2598	3121	However, like I mentioned in the second paragraph, I do think that making a rating system for books is a good idea that allows the authors to express themselves fully, and also allows readers to know what controvercial material is in the book without them being affected by the information they would have read without the warning	14
2599	3121	I would strongly advise you consider my proposal, because it has the potential to prevent future confrontations between authors and the public.	15
2600	3122	Why @CAPS1 @CAPS2	0
2601	3122	Is there movies, music, magazines, books, and more in our libraries today seen as offensive to some	1
2602	3122	A good portion of people believe so, and there is some that @CAPS2 doesn't even concern	2
2603	3122	So should they be removed from the shelves of our public libraries or should they be able to stay	3
2604	3122	Katherine Paterson made a statement and a part out of @CAPS2 said ' But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work that I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	4
2605	3122	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     @CAPS3, I believe that some of the literature and magazines should be taken out of the libraries just because of the content many books are loaded with foul language, violence, sex appeal, ect	5
2606	3122	For example I can recall a day I went to a local library with my little sister, and she was looking for a disney magazine and there were provocative magazines on the shelf that had half naked women on the cover right next to the kids magazines	6
2607	3122	To me this is an image of selling sex	7
2608	3122	What parent would want there child learning about sex at a young age	8
2609	3122	Next, even the music today placed in libraries is not good clean music	9
2610	3122	A lot of the music today is also sellling sex, violence, and drugs	10
2611	3122	My father tells me all the time till this very day that music back in the day was appropriate for all ages	11
2612	3122	Music such as hip hop, and rap, is the main source for all the inappropriate stuff, but the rappers and producers are not to blame causse they are only creatimg what people want and what is selling	12
2613	3122	Also, the movies rented out of the libraries today are very offensive	13
2614	3122	They seem to contain the same material as the books, magazines, and music.They all portray the same image that seems to be entertaining to majority of the society today	14
2615	3122	So can we just find something better to catch the attention of the audience who buy this material	15
2616	3122	In conclusion, I do believe that this material should be taken off the shelves of public libraries	16
2617	3122	But I dont think @CAPS2 would do any good, cause people will just find another source to get @CAPS2	17
2618	3122	Like Katherine said @CAPS2 won't be any books left if its all taken off	18
2619	3123	I believe censorship should be used in libraries to a certain extent	0
2620	3123	There are too many children that have access to inappropriate materials at the library, but some of it could be useful	1
2621	3123	There was a time when I borrowed a movie from the public library	2
2622	3123	When I went home to watch it with my mother, it turned out to be highly inappropriate and offensive, not to mention awkward and embarassing	3
2623	3123	My mom and I couldn't believe that a person of any age could have access to a movie as inappropriate as the movie '@CAPS1'	4
2624	3123	Although there are some materials that should not be in the library, there are some materials that could be thought of by some people to be offensive that are in the library for educational purposes	5
2625	3123	Some people think gay rights, abortion, and teenage sexual activity are offensive	6
2626	3123	There @MONTH1 be some people that would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or a problem in their personal lives	7
2627	3123	Somebody @MONTH1 have a family member who believes they are homosexual, a daughter who has become sexually active, or a woman @MONTH1 be thinking about recieving an abortion	8
2628	3123	What is offensive to some, @MONTH1 not be offensive to others	9
2629	3123	I believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials	10
2630	3123	If it is educational, it @MONTH1 be useful to some people	11
2631	3123	There will never be a perfect answer for a problem like this in the world	12
2632	3123	As the world evolves, so does the human race's morals and there is nothing that is offensive to all the people in the world.	13
2633	3124	Have you ever been offended by a movie, book, song, or magazine	0
2634	3124	Did you have a choice on whether or not you watched and/or read the item	1
2635	3124	The question that seems to be of intrest to people is should these items that are offensive be taken off the shelves	2
2636	3124	I don't think they should	3
2637	3124	I am sure that you could ask anyone if they have ever been offended by a movie, book, or magazine and all of them could give an example	4
2638	3124	I doubt they ever watched the movie again and if they did it obviously wasn't that bad	5
2639	3124	If something offends you, don't read or watch it	6
2640	3124	If you don't want your kids watching something, don't let them	7
2641	3124	You can make that desicion	8
2642	3124	No one is making you watch or read any of that	9
2643	3124	I know I have watched a movie or two that I probably shouldn't have	10
2644	3124	I've even read some books that are not the best, but I choose to read them	11
2645	3124	No one forced the act on me	12
2646	3124	Some of you @MONTH1 ask, '@CAPS1 about at school?' If a teacher assigns a book to read and your child does not feel comfortable with it, then take it up with the teacher	13
2647	3124	They will be more than understanding and possibly give your child a different book	14
2648	3124	They might even explain why he or she is having the class read the book and why the children need to be exposed to this type of literature	15
2649	3124	There are always going to be offensive books and movies out there	16
2650	3124	If you take out all the books in a library that has offended someone at one point in time, you probably wouldn't have much of a library left	17
2651	3124	The shelves would be bare	18
2652	3124	You have a choice to read or watch something	19
2653	3124	If it is offensive don't watch it	20
2654	3124	Everyone has different views on that book or movie	21
2655	3124	It @MONTH1 be offensive to you, but to the next person it might be a really good show	22
2656	3124	I don't think offensive books, magazines, music, or movies should be taken off the shelves.	23
2657	3125	Libraries have tons of books from comedy all the way to violent.Some people like reading books about war and violence while others find it offencive	0
2658	3125	No matter what the book is about people have the choice to read them or not so why should libraries have to remove books that some might find offensive	1
2659	3125	They shouldn't	2
2660	3125	Every one has different views on ideas, and not everyone is alike	3
2661	3125	If all the books that were offencive to someone where takin off the shelf, there would be no more books left	4
2662	3125	People walk into the library and most of the time books are labled by what they are about	5
2663	3125	They walk to the section they like and pick out a book and normaly don't go to the section that they don't like	6
2664	3125	There is no reason to go to the section that they dont like becasue they wont be reading a book from there becasue they dont like it	7
2665	3125	They would just cause problems and disturb the ones that do enjoy reading those types of books	8
2666	3125	People have the choice to read a book or not so why bother even worry what other people are reading as long as they are happy with what thye have	9
2667	3125	If a parent does not want a child to read a certain type of book that is their buisness but other parents might want their child to soo what all is out there and develope their child's views on subjects	10
2668	3125	Everyone has different views and ideas	11
2669	3125	If every one was the same the world would be boring and there would be notheing to talk about	12
2670	3125	By reading different types of books and listening to different types of music there is always somthing to talk about becasue not everyone knows the same subjects	13
2671	3125	Reading a new kind of book might even open people's eyes to what differences there are in the world	14
2672	3125	Children often times are more open to different ideas than adults are so if the books are not there for children to try and read they will never know what they like and do not like	15
2673	3125	A book a child likes @MONTH1 not be that a nother child likes or even an adult likes but that is normal, people are not the same	16
2674	3125	If everyone took the books or music off the self that they found offensive there wouldn't be very much of anything left on the shelves	17
2675	3125	Styles are most the time oppisits, like comedy and sad books	18
2676	3125	Most poeple who would like comedy wouldn't like sad and visa-versa there fore they would take the other off the shelf so neither would have anything to read or listen to	19
2677	3125	Even with some of the best selling books poeple wonder why or how so many sold but thats just how it is	20
2678	3125	People out there like the book so if one person didnt like it all those people would never have known what that book is about and @MONTH1 have changed their life	21
2679	3125	Books can be very impactfull in people's lives and if they never read that book the change would never have been made to their life.The world goes round becasue of differences and the world becomes a better place because of different ideas	22
2680	3125	everyone cannot be the same it just would not work	23
2681	3125	Libraries should not have to take books off the shelf just because someone found it offensive or did not like it	24
2682	3125	People have the choice to read books or not and different views and ideas are good to make things more interesting	25
2683	3125	Moreover, if everyone tooks books and music off the shelves they did not like there would not be very many books and music left	26
2684	3125	So if you run into a book or some music you dont like just ignore it, dont read it or listen to it	27
2685	3125	Things will be much simpler in the long run.	28
2686	3126	Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not	0
2687	3126	If a library feels that if a book is too graphic, a movie too violent or that music to agressive then its their own choice to remove it or not	1
2688	3126	It is true that that it's pointless to try and censor the lives of kids and teenagers.Explicit content is all around not only in the media and literature	2
2689	3126	The never ending game of shielding this generations teenagers and children is already finished	3
2690	3126	In this point in time, the main focus of alot of movies and music and books is something violent, agressive, inapproiate, or explicit	4
2691	3126	The idea of removing these things from library shelves is pointless	5
2692	3126	The will always be violence and crime in todays world along with excessive swares and cuss words all around	6
2693	3126	It's exceptable that some parents don't want their children reading,watching or listening to something they don't or wouldn't approve of but even if the kids are protected and home out in the world sometimes the parents wont be there	7
2694	3126	Libraries are public places, and a percent of the audience would be upset, frusterated or angr if the books, music or movies they liked were no longer avalable due to the cencorship	8
2695	3126	It @MONTH1 seem as if viewing, reading or listening to something violent or explicit, would have an effect on the listener	9
2696	3126	On the streets, at school, at the park and more places children and teens will be exposed to this type or explicit language so attempting to cencor it in their reading and viewing matterial is just pointless	10
2697	3126	In my experence I have grown up and been around people who have grown up listening to violent music, watching graphic movies and more explicit material and not been effected	11
2698	3126	I saw my first rated @CAPS1 movie when i was nine, so parents can give thier kids somewhat of an age but at one point trying to cencor anything is a waste of time	12
2699	3126	With schools now teaching their students the positives of being abstinent and the sexual deseases, students are more likely to refrain despite what they see in movies, read about, or listen to	13
2700	3126	Any child exposed to the internet could be subject to all kinds of inapproite material, explicit canotent, bad language, cuss words, and disturbing images	14
2701	3126	Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not	15
2702	3126	Trying to block the explicity and violence in the world is an endless battle	16
2703	3126	Certain things @MONTH1 go over the line, but others are just renactments and previews of whats really going on in this world.Why would you hinder the real world away from children and teenagers	17
2704	3126	Movies have a rating and music @CAPS4 have an explicit content label so people should know whats approiate for themselves	18
2705	3126	The first sware word a child hears probably wasnt in a song or movie and was probably somewhere in the real world.	19
2706	3127	There are many books in the library that shouldn't be there	0
2707	3127	From books about racism, violence, or pornagraphy I wouldn't want my young children to be able to take those type of books out of the library	1
2708	3127	A library in a school is a great way to help sudents with projects, essays, or just to read	2
2709	3127	If my child was in elementry or even middle school , I wouldn't at all want them to be able to check out a book about things they shouldn't even know about yet	3
2710	3127	If my teenager was in high school though, I wouldn't mind that because they are old enough to realize the things that actually go on in the world	4
2711	3127	They also could be doing a project over the wrongs of pornagraphy, in which the library is better place to find a book then the interent that could take them to many bad websites	5
2712	3127	Since I go to my local high school I think its nice to be able to find anything I need in my library at school	6
2713	3127	It makes it easier to work on projects	7
2714	3127	Also in libraries there are a ton of music, movies, and magazines	8
2715	3127	If a library has educational music, why not keep them in there	9
2716	3127	If the music is rap, pop, or country they could just get it from @CAPS1 instead of the library providing it	10
2717	3127	Magazines can also be educational	11
2718	3127	If you are doing a project on fashion a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 would be excellent to help them find out some tips	12
2719	3127	Magazines can also have some inaproprate things in them	13
2720	3127	Since all they talk about in the media is sex, sex articles would probably be in the magazines	14
2721	3127	Whenever I look in magazines I just skip all of that nonsense they talk about and read the articles about clothes, food, and people	15
2722	3127	Exposing that to young children wouldn't be the best, but for teenagers they understand	16
2723	3127	Movies shouldn't be in the library unless they are educational too	17
2724	3127	There are a ton of @CAPS4 around that those scary movies don't need to be in a library	18
2725	3127	In conclusion I think it all depends on what kinds of kids are going into the library	19
2726	3127	For young children, stay with the cartoon educational type things	20
2727	3127	For teenagers, keep it educational but be more relaxed about it	21
2728	3127	If something offends you, go have a talk with the libraian they woukd probably be happy to take it off the shelf.	22
2729	3128	Books can be good things, but are they always good	0
2730	3128	They teach us things, entertain us, and are sometimes good pillows, but they can also be bad things	1
2731	3128	When a book is inappropriate for the reader, then it should not be on the shelves of the library	2
2732	3128	Music is the same way	3
2733	3128	The library should absolutely take the book off the shelf if it is found offensive by someone	4
2734	3128	Some books @MONTH1 be offensive in religious ways	5
2735	3128	A person @MONTH1 believe in something very strongly, and then a book goes and makes fun of it or trashes it in some way	6
2736	3128	Some @MONTH1 say that the person just shouldn't read the book, but if it were me, I would want the book gone so it didn't remind me of what it had said everytime I walked by it	7
2737	3128	Books @MONTH1 even be inappropriate for little kids	8
2738	3128	It @MONTH1 have language in it that the parents don't like	9
2739	3128	People have said that they should just make a section for those books to where little kids can't get to them, but you don't know what the childs parents are like	10
2740	3128	they could think a word is bad when you think it's fine	11
2741	3128	Everyone is different	12
2742	3128	Furthermore, a book @MONTH1 contain images not suitable for children	13
2743	3128	It comes back to what I was saying before, you can't just make a section for these books and say the heck with it	14
2744	3128	Libraries could even consider censoring some of their books	15
2745	3128	Some religions believe that some types of music is the devils music	16
2746	3128	I know from experience that my mother thinks that scream-o is the devils music	17
2747	3128	She says that it is not right for them to sing like that and that @CAPS1 wouldn't like it	18
2748	3128	Other peoples parents @MONTH1 feel the same way	19
2749	3128	Magazines @MONTH1 also have words or images in them that someone could take the wrong way	20
2750	3128	Although I don't believe libraries should remove them, but they should still watch who reads them	21
2751	3128	They could even put a little label on the front cover of the magazine that says it @MONTH1 not be suitable for everyone	22
2752	3128	Books are usually good things, although they can be very bad	23
2753	3128	In the end, libraries should consider censoring their books, or if the book is bad enough and gets enough complaints, take it off the shelves completely	24
2754	3129	Just because I agree with something, do you have to agree too 	0
2755	3129	Your cousin believing in one thing,means you have to believe in it also	1
2756	3129	No,not in my opinion, and I hope not in yours either	2
2757	3129	If you were to see something you find offensive does that have to mean it offends another around you	3
2758	3129	The world contains things that children agree with and parents do not and this world consists of things that you like and others will not, but that does not make that item or that object invaluable or offending, and not the least bit inappropriate	4
2759	3129	Objects containing so called offensive material are always going to exist in the world we live in and they have for a while	5
2760	3129	They are going to be everywhere;in stores , in schools, inside, outside , they are all around, and there is no reason for them to be a problem	6
2761	3129	They will not disappear and that is nothing we want to have to worry about,that could become a criminal offence of any sorts	7
2762	3129	So why fight it,well I say we don't	8
2763	3129	Do you think that seeing an offensive item makes an area all the less attractive and good intended	9
2764	3129	What if something you liked ,was of an offence to another , does that make it all the more wrong for you to like it	10
2765	3129	Almost all the things and materials in this world are liked and disliked all based upon opinions	11
2766	3129	Nothing in this world exists without opinions	12
2767	3129	Life in itself can be an opinion	13
2768	3129	I believe that if there is something in a library that is deemed offensive by one,it is not deemed offensive by all	14
2769	3129	Nothing should be removed from a shelf or a rack because another doesn't agree with it	15
2770	3129	Substitute other objects or ideas with this, if one person in the world was offended by another person would you just remove them from the human race	16
2771	3129	No, I sure hope you would not, but to some they @MONTH1 see that as their one resolution	17
2772	3129	Well me, I do not, and I'm a strong willed, strong opinionated person and to me that is all wrong	18
2773	3129	Anything published or released to the world, to the public by someone means that is their way of expressing something, it is their way of living, and they have that right	19
2774	3129	That is who they are, and that is what they like,that is another person , anything we see or hear in this world is someone else because that has come from an individual who is equal to us,so why lessen there equivalence because its not the same way I feel	20
2775	3129	We @MONTH1 not all agree with their way of life, we @MONTH1 not agree with their choice of clothes, but how are we to know if we agree with their way of heart	21
2776	3129	No characteristic dictates the other characteristics of another,so why should an item	22
2777	3129	A good thing to you could be a bad thing to another, and what if that disappeared	23
2778	3129	Taking a cd off a shelf will not vanish it from the world, it could be found somewhere else, but still that is like eliminating your hand because your fingers don't look like mine	24
2779	3129	Nothing can justify removing things from the stores and the world because one group of people don't understand it enough to feel the same and agree with it	25
2780	3129	Anything could be deemed inappropriate,but what if your vision of appropriate is anothers eye to inappropriate	26
2781	3129	Maybe there just is no line of the definition inappropriate,especially in the world we live in today	27
2782	3129	If we start eliminating and removing everything we don't like, we would have nothing left, any and everything could be gone within a week or a month	28
2783	3129	People would take an inch to a mile , and erase everything, then we would start eliminating people we do not like , and it would all become a repeat	29
2784	3129	We learn about our history for a reason, does any of this resemble a situation or two the world has already been through	30
2785	3129	Erasing things from lives,have done no good before	31
2786	3129	If we start listening to the facts of people not agreeing with one thing, we will listen to the next, what happens when all the sudden the people come in again and say they do not like the women with blonde hair or the men with green eyes	32
2787	3129	The world will crash and burn before our eyes, and if I can identify these things at the age of fifteen, then some need to identify things at the age of fifty, accept that the world has its flaws too	33
2788	3129	So just because I agree with everything I said , are you going to agree with it also	34
2789	3129	No I know you will not,but think about that when you expect others to agree with what you say or think	35
2790	3129	When I think of people reducing the things that they do not like, I can already see the world losing it's pathetic value it has earned, and we @MONTH1 not all be fond of this world but we cannot lose it	36
2791	3129	Eliminating the things you do not have a fatuation with will do no good, so maybe we should take into acceptance the different people we've been blessed with and love what we have	37
2792	3129	Accept the world as it is,because it is what you live in and it is what you have,because with out it nothing would be anything.Attempt to fix the broken things not eliminate the jagged things	38
2793	3130	offensive materials in libraries should not be taken off of the shelves because of their content	0
2794	3130	Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could obscure their message	1
2795	3130	people live around offensivness every day on the street and in public places so censoring it in libraries would not protect anyone	2
2796	3130	Removing the books from libraries entirely could also interfere with research or school projects children have to work on for class	3
2797	3130	Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could potentially obscure a message or major theme of the novel	4
2798	3130	This style of writing can be seen in @PERSON1's novel To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 by @PERSON1 using terms that are offensive to @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to set the one of the racial tension in the south at that period in time	5
2799	3130	This type of censorship would also be detrimental if a reader studying the holocaust can not view pictures of death camps because of the graphic nature, the reader would not be able to understand the true horror of the camp without it	6
2800	3130	People live around offensivness every day at home, on the streets, and even in school	7
2801	3130	A normal person encounters several occasions a day where they @MONTH1 hear profanities on the street from passing strangers or friends	8
2802	3130	Parents sometimes curse or use profanties in front of their children to prove a point or just by accident, and this would expose children to offensive behavior just as much as adults	9
2803	3130	Children are also exposed to profain language and behavior when they go to school and work around ither childern who might have offensive behaviors	10
2804	3130	Censorship of books in libraries could interfere with school or work related projects and research	11
2805	3130	Censorship could be an issue if a student could not get a book on a major war or event because of graphic nature, and this would hinder the students ability to efficiently complete their assignment	12
2806	3130	It could also cause problems if a teacher needs to rents a book that has slight profanity in it but is not able to because of the content, inhibiting her from teaching her students about the theme and lesson	13
2807	3130	Censorship of books based on the content should not be allowed in libraries	14
2808	3130	first of all trying to censor a novel might abscure the message or theme	15
2809	3130	secondly people live around profanity every day so trying to censor it would not protect people because they have likely already heard what is said in the novel	16
2810	3130	lastly censorship of libraries could interfere with work or school projects or research	17
2811	3130	If all libraries were censored it could potentially lead to several complications with workers, students, or people who are just looking for a good book to read	18
2812	3131	Libraries are sometimes connotated as very boring	0
2813	3131	Walking up and down isles looking at all of the books, and wishing that they were all more interesting	1
2814	3131	Minutes after searching through the one shelf you have been rummaging through for what seems like hours, you get a glimpse of a very interesting title	2
2815	3131	Inside of this book could be countless inappropriate pictures and profanity on every page	3
2816	3131	Who is to blame for opening the book and reading it	4
2817	3131	Profanity, nudity, and crude humor, as well as many other things, are all over the media, including books	5
2818	3131	Some parents try very hard to keep their children out of the way of those things by telling the child that they just simply cannot watch, listen to, or read certain things	6
2819	3131	The parents typically do not say why they are not letting their child see, hear, or read these things, other than, 'it is bad, and I said no.' If parents were to tell their child specifically why they were not supposed to be exposed to certain things, the child might not be so inclined to get involved in those things	7
2820	3131	Not only should the parents teach their child why they should not be exposed to those things, but maybe they should be around when their kids have an opportunity to see things they shouldn't	8
2821	3131	And if a child is too young to see, hear, or read certain things, than they are far too young to be browsing a library or any other place where they are not properly guided by a parent	9
2822	3131	Censorship, in my opinion, should not be done by libaries, movie producers, television programs, and record companies, it should be done by the parents of a child.	10
2823	3132	Brian @PERSON1 @NUM1 @DATE1 @CAPS1 @NUM2                                    Censorship in Libraries          Should there be censorship in Libraries	0
2824	3132	If this is a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 library no, but if it is a @ORGANIZATION1 library, yes	1
2825	3132	I am going to tell you what I think about the books, movies and magazines	2
2826	3132	First I'm going to tell you about the books	3
2827	3132	I think the books in a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 should not be censored because parts of history get kind of gross and nasty	4
2828	3132	Then also sex ed books need to be in the library so people can read about it and not just go with what other people say	5
2829	3132	I don't think they should matter if its a nasty love book or a @CAPS2 @PERSON2 book, all that matter is that they are reading	6
2830	3132	War books should not be censored because they need to let the reader know how war really is and its not a great place to be	7
2831	3132	Now in a @ORGANIZATION1 library yes because no parent would want their eight year old daughter reading about how to make drugs	8
2832	3132	I think they could put stuff in there about drug or alcohol perhaps but not go in depth, but keep it at a bare minimum	9
2833	3132	Next  I'll talk about the movies they should have avalible in the library	10
2834	3132	I don't think anything over @NUM3 at a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 level	11
2835	3132	Exept like sex ed tapes and history movies, no free days in class, its got to be @NUM3	12
2836	3132	In @ORGANIZATION1 I it should be @CAPS3-@CAPS4 movies	13
2837	3132	In those grade they really dont watch educational films it's all for fun films, so theres no reson for there to be anything worse than @CAPS3-@CAPS4	14
2838	3132	Last I'm going to tell you about magazines	15
2839	3132	In @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I don't think the magazines are a big issue	16
2840	3132	Just as long as theres not @CAPS7 and stuff like that	17
2841	3132	At the @ORGANIZATION1 leave again I think they should be, kids that age shouldn't be reading @ORGANIZATION2	18
2842	3132	They just need to have learning and for fun magazines	19
2843	3132	Should there be censorship in libraries	20
2844	3132	No at the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 level and yes at the @ORGANIZATION1 level	21
2845	3132	@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 leave the book shouldn't @ORGANIZATION1 they should, should in both @ORGANIZATION1 movies, and magazines shouldn't in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 and should in @ORGANIZATION1.	22
2846	3133	To begin with I feel everyone should admire the libraries	0
2847	3133	I feel this way because at one point of time we didnt even have books let alone libraries to get books from	1
2848	3133	A library is a place that has a peacful and calm environment	2
2849	3133	People come to hang out at the library to collect good books, surf the internet, check out new music and aslo to relax	3
2850	3133	So to answer the question 'Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the selves at the library if found offensive?' @CAPS1, I believe if things are on the shelf that @MONTH1 come off offensive to people they should absolutely be removed	4
2851	3133	You shouldn't have to be in an environment were things are offending you	5
2852	3133	If things seem to come off offending, it will make indivuals stop coming to the library	6
2853	3133	This will make the library loose alot of business due to lack of service	7
2854	3133	The library should be a place that consist of love, peace and harmony	8
2855	3133	It should be a place were people should feel free and relieved from any stress	9
2856	3133	By seeing or hearing something that comes off very offensive will tend to bring confusion to the library	10
2857	3133	This also will make the librarians job much harder than what it should be	11
2858	3133	They will have to work harder to satisfy the difficulties that you seem to be having with the library	12
2859	3133	Something that would offend me in a library is some of the music they carry	13
2860	3133	Certain types of music shouldnt be found in a library	14
2861	3133	An  example of some offensive music is the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' music, meaning the music with all types of different profanity	15
2862	3133	The music that is degrading women in a very disrespectful manner	16
2863	3133	Also the music that's making it seem cool to be violent	17
2864	3133	This will come off offensive to many men and women	18
2865	3133	Think about it who wants to listen to music thats makes women feel like their not worth anything and who wants to listen to music that's always talking about killing, fighting and gangs etc	19
2866	3133	People whould like to hear more soothing and relaxing music	20
2867	3133	The music that makes you happy no matter the mood your in	21
2868	3133	The library should just pick their music wisely so everyone can be well satisfied	22
2869	3133	In conclusion as stated the library is a great place to hang out and just to relax	23
2870	3133	It should never come off as a place with things that is offensive of so it should get removed	24
2871	3133	This would keep down less confusion and more people would continue to attend the library because they know what a nice place it really is	25
2872	3134	Some people might think that it is a good idea to censor things on library	0
2873	3134	People might think that some of the material might be offensive of bad for the youth of the people who go to libraries.People might think it @MONTH1 be better to take the bad and offensive item off the shelf	1
2874	3134	I have a different opion on the subject	2
2875	3134	I don't think anything should be censored in the library no matter if it deal with book, movies, music, magazines, ect.,     The real question is why should this material be censored removed	3
2876	3134	The answer to that question is that it should not be sensored  removed	4
2877	3134	The library is somewhere you can go to get information on just about anything you want	5
2878	3134	If these items are censored or taken off the shelfs the resources would be limited and or no help to the people searching for the information	6
2879	3134	Another big problem with censoring or removint these materials is people might be missing out on alot of knowleged that they have never herd of that might be bad or offensive	7
2880	3134	Such as slavery, the @CAPS1 taking over the @CAPS2, and a lot of our world history	8
2881	3134	I feel strongly about people knowing about the worlds past	9
2882	3134	Now what happens if the items are removed from the shelfs of libraries	10
2883	3134	what are you going to do with the thousands of books that you can no longer read because it is offensive	11
2884	3134	We just can't get rid of them just like that	12
2885	3134	A lot of the offensive stuff is true or based on a true story such as @ORGANIZATION1 park getting arrested because she refused to give up a seat to a white person	13
2886	3134	so removing these books would be pointless because where ever you put them people will just go there to get the material they want to know about	14
2887	3134	The most important thing about this is who want these books censored or gone and why they want to remove them	15
2888	3134	Okay some book are bad and offensive but you have to look at it this way	16
2889	3134	People have there own choice on what they want to read , watch,or listen to	17
2890	3134	So just because some people dont like the material in a library doesn't mean everyone else doesn't like it	18
2891	3134	It the peoples choice not a opion on what a couple people say	19
2892	3134	So at the end i think that books and other items in a library sould not be censored or taken off the shelfs	20
2893	3134	I believe that people have the right to read, listen, or watch what ever they want	21
2894	3134	I see it as people opions fighting opions on removing the books	22
2895	3134	Also if people don't like the book at the library then no one told them thay have to go meaning their opion really doesn't matter	23
2896	3135	Okay, to me, people are way to moral in the modern world, i was taught that if you have a problem keep it to yourself	0
2897	3135	Most of everyone know that censorship is a big deal but it doesnt have to be	1
2898	3135	I know that somethings are a little, risque, but getting this our their quicker would be a better solution	2
2899	3135	Your probably asking yourself, how in the world can this be a 'better solution'	3
2900	3135	Lets talk about children and this content, if you get this out there quicker and subtlely, the children wont see the need to find out what it is at a later age	4
2901	3135	If that was to happen the conseqences could be fatal, such as	5
2902	3135	fines, misdemenors, respect, reputation, and even some time in jail	6
2903	3135	Tell the kids about murder, drugs, sex, and crimes in general, they are twice as moldable then as they are when they are older	7
2904	3135	Taking them off our shelves will only make us a nicer community, yea i know what your thinking, why not do that	8
2905	3135	If more people in your community are nicer, when a real threat comes, whos gonna help	9
2906	3135	The @CAPS1	10
2907	3135	who knows, it takes a little bit for a squad car to get around, even longer if your in a city	11
2908	3135	In that time, some one could have died, been robbed and that same criminal gone	12
2909	3135	So, if we let this stay out on the shelves and so on, people will have the knowledge to see that using these to help people can be benifical	13
2910	3135	Anyways, what im trying to say is, if you take this away from us, people will become weaker, if you let it stay, people will learn from it and use it for good	14
2911	3136	Have you ever watched or seen a book or even a movie that you do not think kids should be reading or watching	0
2912	3136	I have, heard of many books	1
2913	3136	There are even music out there that only adults should be listening too	2
2914	3136	There are some parents that are strick on what their kids watch, hear, read or sing	3
2915	3136	I know for a fact that my parents would not want me to be letting my childern read, watch or hear that kind of stuff	4
2916	3136	When you think of the music, books, or movies that need to be out of childern reach what should they be	5
2917	3136	I think the movies, books and even music that have bad language, violence, and bullying need to be hidden from childern	6
2918	3136	Bad language is not apporaite from kids to be hearing when they are under the age of ten or even older	7
2919	3136	When you hear a bad song coming on when you have little kids near you, you should turn the station to a differnet station	8
2920	3136	If little kids hear this kind of language they well be saying it when the are young	9
2921	3136	Another book, song or music that should be taken off the shelf should be ones that have violence	10
2922	3136	If kids watch, hear or read about violence, they are most likely to start being violent when they start hearing or reading about it	11
2923	3136	When you are walking around you, you should not be scared to walk by yourself with out getting attacked	12
2924	3136	If you see someone reading or watcing something that you do not think is right for them you should tell them not to be reading or watching that	13
2925	3136	Violence is bad for little kids to be doing when they are young	14
2926	3136	Books, movies or music about bullying should be taken out of	15
2927	3136	Bullying is not the answer to everything, even though many think it is it is not	16
2928	3136	If you think it is good for little kids to be learning about bullying you are wrong	17
2929	3136	It is a bad thing for little kids	18
2930	3136	Bullying also gets you in trouble when you are caught doing the bullying	19
2931	3136	Have you ever thought of a book that should be taken off the shelf	20
2932	3136	The books that I think that should be taken off the shelf would be the ones that have bad language, violence, and bullying	21
2933	3136	Childern should not be hearing or reading about bad language	22
2934	3136	They also should not be watcing anything about violence	23
2935	3136	Lastly they should not be reading anything about bullying	24
2936	3137	Some books in libraries offend others	0
2937	3137	So should they be removed	1
2938	3137	That is the point im going to get across today	2
2939	3137	Keeping people under self-control is top priorities for the public	3
2940	3137	So why do they keep releasing and publishing books if it offends certain groups	4
2941	3137	Graphic and gorey books are books usually that disgust people but should all contain a warning symbol on it for people with weak stomachs and those who just can't handle it	5
2942	3137	So by that means, I'm fine with it	6
2943	3137	People need to accept that the world is not all sunshine and rainbows and that gruesome stuff is out there	7
2944	3137	This is my take on the whole situation	8
2945	3137	So people, if you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen	9
2946	3137	However offense material to races, religions, and other personal aquisitions, is something of different concerns	10
2947	3137	This can certainly inflame groups, and even start protest or boycotting it	11
2948	3137	Authors in some cases need to review their materialand make sure it won't cause any disruption	12
2949	3137	Inflaming the public is not what you want young authors	13
2950	3137	This can not only make the public upset, but can possibly lead to the author getting fired	14
2951	3137	False statement or inaccurate statements in books can lead to public curiosity and even conspiracy	15
2952	3137	Not only will it cause a stir up in the press, but just like the race/religion thing, it can cause the author to be fired	16
2953	3137	This is not what the author wants	17
2954	3137	So making sure the work is true and not hipotheticle is a good step	18
2955	3137	These are great steps to achieving a positive step to public influence	19
2956	3137	So inconclusion, authors have lots on their hands	20
2957	3137	All the way from race issues, religion, fale statements, and so on	21
2958	3137	These are some of the things authors want to avoid	22
2959	3137	Making the public recommend the book, and it having positive outcome on the press is the best an author can ask for	23
2960	3138	In libraries, there should not be censorship on materials considering that it's an individual's decision to read what they prefer	0
2961	3138	There is no appropriate standard on what makes a book offensive to a group, so it should be undetermined as to what makes a book offensive	1
2962	3138	In a public library, many children, who the books are censored for, are with their parents	2
2963	3138	Parents should make an independent choice on what they can allow their children to read	3
2964	3138	Letting society ban a book simply for the use of inappropriate materials is ridiculous	4
2965	3138	If an author spent time creating a story, it should be appreciated, and should not put on a list of no-nos	5
2966	3138	If a certain person doesn't like a book's reputation, all they have to do is not read it	6
2967	3138	Even in school systems, librarians are there to guide kids to read good books	7
2968	3138	If a child wants to read an inappropriate book, the librarian will most likely discourage him or her not to read it	8
2969	3138	In my experience, I wanted to read a book that my mother suggested to me, but as I went to the school library it turned out to be a censored book	9
2970	3138	Some parents believe children should be ignorant about offensive things written in books, but honestly many of the same ideas are exploited to them everyday on television and internet	10
2971	3138	So trying to shield your child from the bad things @MONTH1 be a great thing, but the efforts are usually failed attempts	11
2972	3138	It also never occurs to the people censoring the books, that some people can't afford to buy the books they want to read	12
2973	3138	The libraries, for some, are the main means for getting books	13
2974	3138	To conclude there is very little reason to ban a book from the shelves	14
2975	3138	Many of the books banned have important lessons that can be obtained through reading it	15
2976	3138	If a person doesn't like a book, the simplest thing to do is not to pick it up.	16
2977	3139	Honestly there's alot of books and magagives that need to be taking off the self	0
2978	3139	I can remember in the sixth grade going to the schools library and picking up a book that not only told me wha weed was it told me how to grow it	1
2979	3139	Also alot of book refer to drug and sex now a days and  absolutly hate it	2
2980	3139	The last book I checked out, even though it is been a while sence ive checked one out, had enough referances to sex that i could honestly say I thought I was read a porn magazine	3
2981	3139	Our schools really need to watch what they put onto there selfs	4
2982	3139	I mean come on sixth graders shouldnt even be able know what weed is	5
2983	3139	Let alone read about it in school	6
2984	3139	maybe that why kids get interested in drugs and achole at such an early age	7
2985	3139	The book I read didnt have any negative satments about the weed	8
2986	3139	what makes anyone think that a book like that would keep kids from doing drugs	9
2987	3139	Like I said before alot of book in schools and pubic librarys have books that refer a lot to drugs and sex	10
2988	3139	They have books now in our library that tell you what the drugs are, what kind of high it'll give you	11
2989	3139	And were you can buy the crap to make them	12
2990	3139	Ok I know im in highschool but you should have book that seem like pron magazines	13
2991	3139	The book i read have pictures of postions in it	14
2992	3139	it broke everything down into details	15
2993	3139	It even gave websites on the back of the book	16
2994	3139	And that my friends is not alright	17
2995	3139	Its just sad	18
2996	3139	It is just starting to scare me about what kind of stuff my little brother and little sister could be reading	19
2997	3139	Doesn't it scare you	20
2998	3139	I know I dont want my siblings to be reading about drugs and sex in detail	21
2999	3139	Let alont them reading about it at all	22
3000	3139	just take the books off the schools and pubic librarys selfs	23
3001	3139	Hardly anyone will read them anyway	24
3002	3139	And if they do its by accident like mine incounters where	25
3003	3140	I think that removing books from a library that are offensive shouldn't be allowed, first off because people have different taste on the books they read	0
3004	3140	I also think that the books that the libary carries are educational, they might be offensive to people but sometimes they are good for learning new things about the world around us	1
3005	3140	Another thing is that a lot of books, movies, music, and magazines might be offensive to you, but if you dont want your child to read those then just keep them away from those types of books at the library, and the people that do want to look at that stuff can	2
3006	3140	So i think it just depends on what kind of stuff people like, everyone likes something different	3
3007	3140	One reason why i think that libraries shouldn't be censored is because some people have different taste in the books they read	4
3008	3140	Some people like scary books, some people like romantic, so  everyone doesnt all like the same thing	5
3009	3140	Everyone might be offended of something but people should't let it bother them	6
3010	3140	My second reason is because books that they carry at the library are usually educational	7
3011	3140	They have learner books for the little kids to help them learn how to read, they have magazines for the people that are interested in the drama around the world, then we have war books for the people that are interested in history, so i dont think that people should really be to offended by the books that people read	8
3012	3140	Another reason is that if you dont want your child or a looking at the books or ect	9
3013	3140	That might look offensive to you then dont let them read them, everyone likes different things, and if you take away things that other people like then your just offendending them too	10
3014	3140	Thats why people that enjoy to go to the library should't take things so offensive, so we don't have to censor things at the library	11
3015	3140	So thats why i think that libraries shouldn't have to be censored at all because people have different taste in the books that they read, that books that libraries carry are usually educational, and if you don't want your child looking at those kind of books then don't let them read them	12
3016	3140	People need to undrstand that some books aren't always trying to offend people, but the ones that are they are just trying to state there own optinon	13
3017	3141	To @CAPS1 it @MONTH1 @CAPS2:     @CAPS3 I walk into a library, I want to be able to think I am in a peaceful place where I can find books that are helpful for what I need and are not harmful to anyone	0
3018	3141	Anywhere I go I want to feel like a free person and shouldn't have to worry about things that will hurt others or myself	1
3019	3141	People are people and everyone should be treated the same	2
3020	3141	It doesnt matter what color your skin is, the way you look, or how you talk	3
3021	3141	Everyone should be treated equaly	4
3022	3141	I believe if there is something offensive in a movie, magazine, books, or anything to any kind of people it should be removed for good	5
3023	3141	It doesnt matter what the past was like	6
3024	3141	The present is all that matters and in my opinion everyone deserves the same	7
3025	3141	I beleive that no one in this world should feel ashamed of who they are	8
3026	3141	If someone is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 they should be proud of it and shouldn't be afraid of negative things that would hurt their feelings	9
3027	3141	I think most people would agree @CAPS3 I say everyone in this world should be treated the absolute same	10
3028	3141	Negative things in books or magazines or anywhere should be removed for good	11
3029	3141	We do not need things like that in our world	12
3030	3141	That is what causes people to become crazy and get into gangs or into drugs	13
3031	3141	Our world shouldn't concist of bad things that will hurt the lives of others	14
3032	3141	Anything that is negative to a person or group of people shouldn't be allowed and should be thrown away	15
3033	3141	Inacent people do not deserve what people received in the past	16
3034	3141	The past has nothing to do with what is going on in the present	17
3035	3141	Right now people should be proud to be who they are and not scared of things like that	18
3036	3141	I treat people the way I want to be treated and that should go for everyone	19
3037	3141	Harmful things need to be removed from everything	20
3038	3141	We do not need things like that in our world	21
3039	3141	People should be able to live free and feel proud of who they are	22
3040	3141	In conclusion I beleive that certain materials should be removed if they are found offensive	23
3041	3141	Everyone is who they are and that shouldn't have an effect on others and the way they live	24
3042	3141	People should feel proud to be here and not scared of things that could impact their lives forever	25
3043	3141	Harmful things are not good in this world and shouldn't have an impact on others	26
3044	3141	Everyone deserves the best and should be treated with care, not hatred.	27
3045	3142	Comics, romance, adventure books, and mystery books are just the few different types of books out there as well as the magazines and music we listen to	0
3046	3142	With a little bit of everything, and whatever your passion is, we have that right in our local libraries to go look at or hear whatever pleases us but, some of the people that go there are not adults	1
3047	3142	Some of them are young children who are either checking out a book themselves or are simply with there parent/guardian	2
3048	3142	I believe that even though there are some books magazines, and music not attended for children, they still shouldn't be removed just because they are found offensive	3
3049	3142	Everyone once in their life had to atleast experience something unpleasant	4
3050	3142	But knowing our world today, we simply can not hide from those things but yet face them, we adults are old enough to just walk away from something we find offensive unlike what our children or other children can do	5
3051	3142	Sometimes, even children have to go through it as well	6
3052	3142	It's part of growing up and also a learning experience for all of us	7
3053	3142	If you already know what parts of the library have stuff children shouldn't see, don't bring your child to that area	8
3054	3142	And if it's possible, bring them to an area where they @MONTH1 sit and read there favorite books as well with you by there side where you can watch there every move	9
3055	3142	And at the same time, you don't have to take a chance at explaining something that you are not quite ready or sure that your child is ready to hear or see	10
3056	3142	Since it's impossible to hide things from your children that you are not wanting them to see and hear at the same time, that's a part of life	11
3057	3142	Even if they are still really young and ask what a certain thing is, we can simply turn there heads and make them get distracted by something else and pretend that we didn't hear what they said	12
3058	3142	But as your children get older, they should know right from wrong and know what things they @MONTH1 read and things they can't	13
3059	3142	Some of us are oblivious to the world around us and @MONTH1 not know that certain things can cause more harm than good, even like taking your children to the library	14
3060	3142	If you don't like a certain thing there or know that there is going to be something you simply do not want your child to see or hear, then don't bother taking them with you on your next visit and go another time when your child is with a babysitter or take a chance into bringing them with you an expect the unexpected when it comes to offensive items at the library	15
3061	3143	To start, if any materials in the library such as books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive i believe that they should still remain on the shelves	0
3062	3143	This book or music @MONTH1 be offensive but everyone is intitled to their own opinon	1
3063	3143	People have all the freedom to read, listen or watch anything that is approperite to them	2
3064	3143	I believe it should all be up to the individual to chose what they should do with what @MONTH1 offend others	3
3065	3143	Also from my own exprience i have read a book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in the stadges of our history where they were salves and were hung for their punishment	4
3066	3143	It @MONTH1 offend some that their local library having a book on such a terrible topic but it is found that it is part of history and others @MONTH1 find it interesting to go back a learn more information	5
3067	3143	It does not have to mean that they are rascist or trying to offend you they would just like to learn more about our history	6
3068	3143	Each person has had topics that offend them but the libraries can not make all happy	7
3069	3143	If you chose to pick a book, watch a movie, or listen to music that @MONTH1 offend someone then it shouldn't be removed, if you would like to read, watch or listen to anything that @MONTH1 offend someone then it should be up to you to decide what to do about it	8
3070	3143	Therefore, i conclude that if any books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive they should remain on the shelves	9
3071	3143	Everyone @MONTH1 have their own opinon or have their own ideals that offend them but it is our job to let those people choose their liking of anything open in our local libraries	10
3072	3143	It is for their own benifit, not for yours	11
3073	3143	It is up to you to decide wheather or not to come about the situation	12
3074	3143	Libraries should not be held responsable and have to removed anything open to the people that @MONTH1 just be part of our background	13
3075	3144	Censorship is used in the media to prevent people from being offended by what they see or hear	0
3076	3144	Although censorship isnt usually a bad thing, it is sometimes over-used	1
3077	3144	Not everyone has the same views and morals, what @MONTH1 be considered appropriate for some people , @MONTH1 be viewed differently by other cultures or religions	2
3078	3144	In my personal opinion if you find something to be offensive, instead of demanding it be removed or censored, simply do not watch, or read it etc	3
3079	3144	Obviously if the content was published in the first place it appeals to some audience	4
3080	3144	No one is forceing people to read or watch things, that is why there is something called viewers disgression	5
3081	3144	If everything that was considered offesive to a certain individual or group where censored , there would be no @LOCATION1	6
3082	3144	In @LOCATION1, we have freedom of speech, the freedom to write or animate to express any belief we choose	7
3083	3144	To censor things out is condraticary to that amendmant	8
3084	3144	For example the censorship of useing the word '@CAPS1' in vain on television	9
3085	3144	I myself find this to be excessive because it doesnt apply to my beliefs 	10
3086	3144	Although the program ' The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6' protrays people of my age and nationality getting pregnant and doing drugs	11
3087	3144	Even though I find this offensive and sterotypical, instead of demanding it be removed, I simply don't watch it	12
3088	3144	I am not saying that I am totally against censorship of certain things, like nudity on television	13
3089	3144	Although if something is censored simply because of a belief, or moral, or worry for a one's children to be subjected to it,that is blowing censorship out of proportion	14
3090	3144	If you find something offensive just keep yourself and your children away from it.	15
3091	3145	Censorship in libraries is not necassary	0
3092	3145	No reading material should be taken off the shelf	1
3093	3145	Every book has a different experience that can help a child learn	2
3094	3145	If the gurdain of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive	3
3095	3145	then the gurdian can forbid the child to read it	4
3096	3145	If people began to take away options on reading materials some kids @MONTH1 refuse to read at all	5
3097	3145	Every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get in to	6
3098	3145	Censoring books at a library is pointless, you take away options, and the experience to learn from certain books	7
3099	3145	Every book has a different plot and a different moral	8
3100	3145	Each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral	9
3101	3145	When you start to remove books from libraries you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book	10
3102	3145	You are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books	11
3103	3145	No book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries	12
3104	3145	Every book removed from the shelves  is another learning experience taken away	13
3105	3145	If there is a book that a child's gurdian disapproves of	14
3106	3145	keep it up to them to forbid their child not to read it	15
3107	3145	A book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life	16
3108	3145	Censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long	17
3109	3145	Every child deserves the chance to read any book they wnat, unless a gurdian forbids	18
3110	3145	It is not up to libraries wether a book is offensive or bad	19
3111	3145	That is soley based on the readers opinion, and everyones opinion is different	20
3112	3145	So again, if a gurdian really wants their child to stay away from certain reading material they can forbid their child by theirselves	21
3113	3145	When libraries begin to censor books they take away the option to pick books	22
3114	3145	When you limit the themes of books in your library, some kids @MONTH1 just pick up less and less books as time goes by	23
3115	3145	Everyone enjoys a differnet kind of book, leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like	24
3116	3145	Although some stories @MONTH1 seem like a bad option, it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out	25
3117	3145	Leaving options open for students is the best idea, because more kids @MONTH1 actually read	26
3118	3145	All in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material	27
3119	3145	Everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book	28
3120	3145	People like their options to be open and at a wide range	29
3121	3145	Each book tells a differnt story and teaches a different moral	30
3122	3145	So leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose	31
3123	3145	Some books helps teach a moral or get a point acoss	32
3124	3145	Also some books help prepare a person for the outside world	33
3125	3145	Taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them	34
3126	3145	In conclusion censorship is a bad idea and should be left to the gurdian of a child	35
3127	3146	Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned	0
3128	3146	In my own personal opinion no I don't think that any books should be banned from a public libaray	1
3129	3146	The authors of books have freedom of speech so yeah some books @MONTH1 offend people but if it offends them they should try stay away from that books or magazines	2
3130	3146	I think that if certain books get banned from the libaray then you won't be able to buy them in stores anymore because the stores will banned them as well	3
3131	3146	In my personal opinion no I don't think that any book should be banned from the public library	4
3132	3146	The reason being is because you can't judge a book by it's cover	5
3133	3146	You don't know if the book is goin to offend you until you read it	6
3134	3146	After you read it or you'r in the middle of reading it and it offends you you should take it back to the library and get a new one	7
3135	3146	Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned	8
3136	3146	In my own personal opinion no I don't think that books should be banned from the public library	9
3137	3146	Because alot of books that do offend people are the one's that teach us about history.	10
3138	3149	You know when you find a @LOCATION1 book on the shelf and discover that the content in the book are not word that are oppropity for children to read	0
3139	3149	Or when you go to copy something and you notice a magazine on the table and find out that the cover of the magazine has an image not for the young mind see	1
3140	3149	Or a movie or music that you see and the content from them shocks you and makes you that they bleep those word	2
3141	3149	I see it more better to have offensive items such as: books, music, movies, magazines, and etc	3
3142	3149	removed from the shelves, because those words and pictures will poison the minds of children and children learn from the world around them stuff like will make the child think that's how your suppose to act and talk	4
3143	3149	Here two example of why they should be remove from the shelves music and magazines	5
3144	3149	First, in deal with music children word immate act they see and the words the say	6
3145	3149	One good example is rap music: their song have cuss words in them and believe me when I tell you this that I have to constantly to kids at my school saying cuss words like the n- and f-word and many more and seeing some boy's underwear, because they think they are being thugs just because they have their pants sagging low	7
3146	3149	It drives me crazy and make me think why are their parents letting their children do this	8
3147	3149	In the next paragraph I will talk about magazines	9
3148	3149	Second, with magazine some of the images they use on their covers and pages are something that are ment to be seen where children read	10
3149	3149	an example for this is when I went into my school library's copying room to copy an article from magazine I found a magazine on the table and it show three of the cast members from @LOCATION1 in their birthday suits	11
3150	3149	I thought what in the world is this doing at my school they should have something like that in a place where kids are in a learning environment	12
3151	3149	Why on earth did they send this to a school for crying out loud	13
3152	3149	What do they think it want bother any kids' parent about it that I sure would be furious about it if I found out that my child had a something that at there school	14
3153	3149	In conclusion, this is why they should be removed from the shelves so the children don't see them.	15
3154	3150	Freedom of press is a right not many countries have	0
3155	3150	America is the land of the free	1
3156	3150	To some, having this much freedom causes great things to happen	2
3157	3150	Without the freedom of press, many of the most classic modern literature would not exist and their messages would be unknown	3
3158	3150	To censorize the right to write freely about ones outlook on the world or government or anything means taking away imagination and in some cases statistics and events that relate to the past	4
3159	3150	Before todays technology, books were one of the only ways to obtain knowledge, and the process to make and publish a book took so long that it was an honor to recieve one of the few copies produced	5
3160	3150	People have a craving for information, they like to learn and advance	6
3161	3150	If all books that were found 'offensive' are stripped off the shelves, information is slowly taken away and the enjoyment of reading would be gone	7
3162	3150	In the brilliant novel, @CAPS1 @NUM1 a man who lives in a distopian society discovers the lack of literature	8
3163	3150	All books found in homes are immediatly taken out and burned in the streets for all to see	9
3164	3150	Children found it entertaining and adults did nothing	10
3165	3150	The man goes through the novel with a secret stash of books of his own	11
3166	3150	Once discovered he is on the run to protect his precious knowledge the government tries so hard to keep from the public	12
3167	3150	Censorship would create nothing but chaos and distruction as in the novel	13
3168	3150	Having the right to know about your countries history or what is going on in your current government is critical in shools and colleges	14
3169	3150	Parents often find offense in the authors schools choose to make students read, saying their ideas and ways of thinking are to single minded and wrong	15
3170	3150	Students need books to grow and learn and if every person chose one book to take off the shelf perminatly, there would be no more books	16
3171	3150	Eventually all information would come from what one would know before the books were banished and in time gone for good	17
3172	3150	Books are a history in themselves, no one wants to hear the raw truth of certain topics such as slavory or the possibility of a complete government take over	18
3173	3150	In order to avoid hearing of this one could simply chose a more ficition novel in which to escape into a fantasy of their own	19
3174	3150	No one can change history, however they can exagorate certain events and without the actual book or cite it came from, one could completely alter the publics view and thoughts of the past	20
3175	3150	Should one take offense to a certain book, they have their own freedom to write a negative blog or report on it	21
3176	3150	Writing is a gift few have naturally and to be able to show off ones talent is a privlage	22
3177	3150	Books help people escape the harsh world we live in, or help them gain more knowledge	23
3178	3150	Censorship is irrevelent, for having all forms of music, movies and magazines stripped of the truth, what does that leave	24
3179	3150	People always strech the truth or tell a 'white lie' however most information is factual	25
3180	3150	The freedom to write and make books and music and movies is not all about entertaining people	26
3181	3150	The messages behind said 'offensive' material could be quite strong and though the author might be long gone, his or her message could live on for decades	27
3182	3151	The entertainment for children and adults consists of movies, music, sports, video games, and reading	0
3183	3151	Books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from any shelf at any time	1
3184	3151	Libraries censor some material because of violence or inappropriate material	2
3185	3151	Children should have the right to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to because it's their life	3
3186	3151	Books, magazines, music, and movies can teach young people about life and the writers, artists, directors, and actors have worked extremely hard on entertaining the people.	4
3187	3151	The materials found 'offensive' should not be removed	5
3188	3151	These materials can be found helpful to others	6
3189	3151	Reading material can help a young person with life	7
3190	3151	If the reader is having problems and needs help, it is possible the book he/she is reading @MONTH1 help them in the thinking process on what they should do	8
3191	3151	The books, movies, and music have been made by extremely hard workers, so why take away their hard work by removing their material just because a couple of people have found it offensive	9
3192	3151	One of the many times i went to the library I was looking for a book I had read before but I could not find it	10
3193	3151	I could not find it because someone else found it inappropriate and had asked that the book be removed from the shelf	11
3194	3151	This hurt me because that book was one of my favorite books to read	12
3195	3151	Some books found 'offensive' or 'inappropriate' and taken off the shelves could be another person's favorite book to read	13
3196	3151	Why take it off the shelf	14
3197	3151	People are being too much self-centered	15
3198	3151	They care about themself and that is it	16
3199	3151	The material being taken off the shelves should be put back on the shelves for the readers who find the material entertaining	17
3200	3151	If a parent does not want their child reading a certain book then they have the authority to take the book away from that child, not the shelves	18
3201	3151	Freedom of the @CAPS1 states that the anybody has the right to write whatever the he/she wants to write	19
3202	3151	If we keep taking books, magazines, music, or movies off of the shelves then we're going to get to the point to where there are no books on any shelf	20
3203	3152	I do not believe that books should be removed from the shelve do to something offensive.Libraries are a very important aspect to life for most people nowadays	0
3204	3152	Mainly because where I live our city is working on a new plan to close the library nearby.For, me and my friends the library is very important because we do not have a computer in our home.The library has the internet and older books with information on the city	1
3205	3152	Living in the society that we have now not every household can afford a computer with internet.Me myself living in one of those households.The library is a great quiet place to get your work done.Its also, provides the internet that people cant afford and need for everyday life.Every job application or school assignment is no longer on paper ,but online	2
3206	3152	Being a @NUM1 grade student we have to alot of projects to do that require old books on the city and history.If they remove certain books of the shelve i @MONTH1 not be able to find important information that I need.Also, I know that every person has their own opinion on what is offensive to them ,however if everyone found something offensive in the book, movie or magazine does that mean it should be removed	3
3207	3152	If that happened there would be a very limited supply of books	4
3208	3152	I have a friend who is mixed with mexican and sometimes she finds slavery very offensive ,but to me I believe that it is important for me to learn about my history.Proving that something that might be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive and maybe very important to the other	5
3209	3152	In conclusion, I disagree with books being removed from the shelve due to offensive content I believe is wrong.Every person is different and find different things offensive ,but things should not be taken away from another person who @MONTH1 need it	6
3210	3153	Everyone has a right to read, listen, or watch what they want	0
3211	3153	Sometimes it's not always up to them	1
3212	3153	For example rated-@CAPS1 movies, most children under @NUM1 cannot watch them	2
3213	3153	Either its a law or the parents have made it a rule	3
3214	3153	Music I think is different	4
3215	3153	Some songs have a bad influence on children whether it has to do with violence or cussing, certain songs like that still give kids the wrong message	5
3216	3153	Libraries should not have those kind of books, music, movies, magazines, etc	6
3217	3153	If people want to view those kind of things that other people find 'offensive' they should buy them on their own time	7
3218	3153	Not everyone has a great sense of humor so things that some people @MONTH1 find funny other people get offended by	8
3219	3153	Even if libraries had anything that would offened someone else, it would be the readers choice to pick a book they want to read	9
3220	3153	Sometimes it @MONTH1 be better off if the children read these articles by themselves so it'd save time from having parents explain it to them later	10
3221	3153	They might ask a lot of questions the parents might not even have the answer for	11
3222	3153	For example, when my brother watched a rated-@CAPS1 movie	12
3223	3153	In my brother's younger years he was always curious and asked a lot of questions all the time	13
3224	3153	Sometimes my mother didn't know how to respond so she'd change the subject	14
3225	3153	Well, everyone knows the same old question '@CAPS3 do babies come from?'	15
3226	3153	That's the kind of question my brother was curious about	16
3227	3153	My mom never bothered to answer that question, but if she did she would make up some story	17
3228	3153	My brother was smart enough to know that what he was being told wasnt accurate at all	18
3229	3153	Finally one day he got nosy and took one of my mom's movies without asking	19
3230	3153	It happen to have the answer to his question	20
3231	3153	He was shocked and disgusted at the same time yet he was glad to know he finally found the answer my mom wouldnt give	21
3232	3153	In this situation I am somewhat nuetral	22
3233	3153	I dont object to having things that might offened other people be removed from book shelves but on the other hand it might not be a good thing to put 'offensive' things and certain libraries @CAPS3 children can get to them	23
3234	3153	Perhaps it's what makes things not boring and makes it more interesting to the reader	24
3235	3153	Not everyone has the same opinion on things	25
3236	3153	It just @MONTH1 be a good thing to have these types of books whether its stating a fact or stating their own opinion	26
3237	3153	Everyone does have a right to say their opinion and there is nothing wrong with giving informational facts in articles or movies either	27
3238	3153	The bad thing about having any 'offensive' things in libraries @MONTH1 not be a smart idea if it's @CAPS3 most children get there books	28
3239	3153	Parentscan always have a say in what kind of book their children read or what kind of movies they watch	29
3240	3153	Some parents might not want to go through all the questions the children ask and give something to them that will explain it better for there understanding, while other parents dont want their children  to see or know of any sort of things that @MONTH1 be 'offensive' until their old enough to understand it better and are mature about those things	30
3241	3153	So in some cases it might be bad idea for things that only an adult should know be on book shelves in a library @CAPS3 a child might get ahold of it	31
3242	3153	The quotation ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	32
3243	3153	But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	33
3244	3153	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' by Katherine Paterson has its own opinion	34
3245	3153	The quotation is basically  saying if even a parent doesnt want their child to read something 'offensive' if that parent reads it that sometime their children have a right to know	35
3246	3153	If the child has tooken anything like that off a shelf that once they know they will not ask anymore questions.	36
3247	3154	Dear @ORGANIZATION1,     I think that it is wrong to remove offensive and other non offensive books from the shelves in the library just because one or two students do not like them or do not want to see others reading them	0
3248	3154	Somethings are ok for reading and learning although they are indeed offensive it is ok for these matrerials to be left on the shelves, if it will be used for a good purpose such as learning and not just for fun	1
3249	3154	It is important for readers to be exposed to a broad spectrum of reading materials	2
3250	3154	Not only should they be exposed to some materials that are not so clean and normal but they should be introduced to things such as foreign writing	3
3251	3154	If we took everyting off the shelves that was a slight bit offensive or was not completely suited for readers would there be many books that would keep peoples atention	4
3252	3154	In conclusion I strongly believe that these materials should be left on the shelf	5
3253	3154	These materials are important for learning in some cases and keep the readers attention	6
3254	3154	Keep these items on the shelves!	7
3255	3155	The censorship in libraries should be as gog as it is for that age group	0
3256	3155	Children of the age @NUM1 to @NUM2 should be able to read books with any profanity	1
3257	3155	they should be mature enough to get through a book that has name calling and uses the profanity without laughing or taking it offensive	2
3258	3155	Children that are @NUM3 should not have books in their libraries with much of this pro-found languge	3
3259	3155	They are young and should not be expecting the fact that there people that use these words to express feeling or name calling	4
3260	3155	They should be able to hear very little or see very little but when they get older they are suppose to be use to this	5
3261	3155	If they dont hear it as much then yes i would agree but they should have a point of censorship in the libraries they are in	6
3262	3155	With children that are younger than @NUM4 years of age they should not read or seee things that have profanity or bad scenes unless their parents let them	7
3263	3155	We cannot controll what parents lets their children do but we can in the schools and in the public libraries	8
3264	3156	I am a citizen of the @LOCATION1 and I believe that the censorship on the material in libraries is not good but it could be better	0
3265	3156	It should be an age limit on certain books and magazines ect	1
3266	3156	in the library	2
3267	3156	Somethings younger children shouldn't be able to read because of the maturity level	3
3268	3156	I remember taking my little sister to the public library and she got a book and began to ask me some words that she shouldn't even be hearing about now	4
3269	3156	On the other hand, those books @MONTH1 be needed	5
3270	3156	Some people need those types of books and magezines for research papers and things like that	6
3271	3156	Now I consider myself a young adult and I believe that other children my age could read about different things and know whats right from wrong	7
3272	3156	Its also up to the parent or gaurdian of the child , if you feel that you dont want your child to read anything thats not appropriate then go with them to the library	8
3273	3156	But then some children dont have a mature parent or gardian that would tell them what to read and what not so thats when the library should do something about the censorship on the books	9
3274	3156	Well I jus wanted to write you this because like I stated before the censorship on the books, movies, music, magazines, ect	10
3275	3156	in the library is ok but it could be jus a little better	11
3276	3156	There should be a certain age when a child reads or see's certain things	12
3277	3156	But you can't just take all the books and things out the library that are not appropriate because some people actually need the books	13
3278	3156	Thats why I believe that it would help if the library had a age limit or made certain things for mature audiance only.	14
3279	3157	If something is to be found offensive, than it should certainly be removed from the shelves	0
3280	3157	When parents send or take their children to a library, they do not expect their child to be able to pick up something that is not appropriate	1
3281	3157	Some items @MONTH1 offend someone's beliefs and be rude	2
3282	3157	Public libraries are just that, public	3
3283	3157	Everything there will be seen by the public and large masses of people	4
3284	3157	No one should have to worry about being offended when they walk into a place of learning and knowledge	5
3285	3157	Parents do not want their child going to the library and picking up rude materials	6
3286	3157	Even if the child does not check the book or magazine out, who is to stop that young, impressionable mind from flipping through the pages	7
3287	3157	Perhaps he or she reads something that his or her parents did not intend on teaching them for some time	8
3288	3157	Books now have a lot of crude text and humor	9
3289	3157	If there is a topic that a younger individual is not mature enough to understand, he or she @MONTH1 get the wrong impression or ideas about the subject	10
3290	3157	If a kid is rumaging through the more adult section of the library, they might be expossed to some information they are not ready for	11
3291	3157	Offensive language @MONTH1 be present in the books and now the young person will see them and try to use the words or phrases	12
3292	3157	If a child read something about sex, he or she might be curious or confused, and ask their parents about it	13
3293	3157	The parents on the other hand, might not have wanted their child to know about the topic at such a young age	14
3294	3157	At that point there would be no turning back	15
3295	3157	Parents would have to explain things that are too mature for some young minds	16
3296	3157	Parents have every right to deny minors and children certain materials, but if the books are out in open, who will censor what is looked at by whom	17
3297	3157	Libraries need to put serious thought into what is on the shelves, no matter what form the information is in	18
3298	3157	People @MONTH1 think just because the story was in a book, than of course it can't be real	19
3299	3157	Some reckless senarios are played out in movies	20
3300	3157	Those movies are watched by people of all ages	21
3301	3157	If an impressionable teenager watches a movies that has offensive language or violent scenes, that teen might act upon what they've seen	22
3302	3157	Since the public library is indeed public, the materials it offers to people should not be offensive	23
3303	3157	All sorts of individuals walk into a library and look around	24
3304	3157	No one should ever walk out a library with the feeling of being offended	25
3305	3157	No parent should have to worry about what their child might pick up	26
3306	3157	Libraries should not cause worry or harm in any way.	27
3307	3160	What is your opinion on reading materials	0
3308	3160	Should people be able to read what they want, or should we limit them to what they read	1
3309	3160	Every library has different choices	2
3310	3160	They can say you can't get this without an adult, or they can just let you check it out and take it home	3
3311	3160	I have read many different things in my lifetime so far	4
3312	3160	I have read books that people have told me were not appropriate, and then nothing bad was in there	5
3313	3160	Most books even if they say one to two choice words it turns into an adult book	6
3314	3160	I think it should be up to the reader, if they can handle a book or not	7
3315	3160	Everyone reacts to things differently	8
3316	3160	Let's take people in my age group, for example, some of the boys are still immature, and think it is funny to act out	9
3317	3160	Those are the kind of people that cannot handle what we call 'adult' material books	10
3318	3160	Most girls are in the stage where they are maturing, still immature, but working their way up the scale	11
3319	3160	They would be able to handle something in the adult material category	12
3320	3160	The reader is smart enough to know what he or she can or cannot handle	13
3321	3160	If we take peoples choice away what are they going to have	14
3322	3160	You would make them feel more like they are being babysat because they have to take their parents to the library, and say hey mommy and daddy pick me out a book because I am not eighteen and cannot pick one	15
3323	3160	I would not like that	16
3324	3160	Being one that reads a lot I know my family is pretty busy and would not be able to find time to ride with me to pick a book	17
3325	3160	Therefore, i would not be able to read as much	18
3326	3160	I mean what do you think	19
3327	3160	Which side would you choose	20
3328	3160	Everything is a personal opinion	21
3329	3160	It is all about what you as a reader is comfortable with	22
3330	3160	Do you want to decide for yourself or have some one with you every step of the way	23
3331	3160	Some people are just too busy to even try to fit it in their schdule to go to the library	24
3332	3160	Others just want to have the freedom to read what they want to read	25
3333	3160	Why stop some one from getting smarter	26
3334	3160	A child will only learn more by challenging themselves	27
3335	3160	Why not let them challenge themselves in a good book, that they got to pick out	28
3336	3160	What do you think	29
3337	3161	I believe that libraries shouldnt be censored becuase people take offense to something	0
3338	3161	Everyone should be able to read, research, or watch anything they want at a library	1
3339	3161	I say this becuase everyone takes offense to something, If people can't find what they're looking for then why go to the library, also everybody likes diffrent things	2
3340	3161	I'll support them in the following paragraphs	3
3341	3161	Have you ever read or seen something that u took offense to you or others	4
3342	3161	normally when someone takes offense to something they try to get rid of the thing offending them	5
3343	3161	If people where to take away things that offended them in librarys what would be left of the shelfs	6
3344	3161	dust	7
3345	3161	Becuase there are many things that people take offensive, everyone is diffrent	8
3346	3161	This is one reason I support no on censorship becuase there would be nothing left	9
3347	3161	Also everyone tends to like many diffrent things	10
3348	3161	I @MONTH1 like something you could possibly hate, should it not be aloud in a library becuase you don't like it	11
3349	3161	No, becuase something you like could be taken away by someone else	12
3350	3161	So if everyone tried to take away the thing they don't like this would be another thing were nothing would be left	13
3351	3161	I think that becuase if we combined everyones things that they hate, it would most likely be everything	14
3352	3161	These two subjects bring me to my last reason, if people cant find what they want	15
3353	3161	Becuase it was taken away, why come to a library	16
3354	3161	People would just stay home to read what they like on the internet and librarys would become empty like there shelfs	17
3355	3161	Then it was a waste of money to make the building, purchase the books for people, and hire librarians	18
3356	3161	Thats wasted tax dallors we could have used for something better	19
3357	3161	After reading all my reasons and opinions I hope you can agree on not having censorship in libraries	20
3358	3161	becuase everyone is offended by something, everyone likes diffrent things, and noone would use a library if what they liked wasn't there	21
3359	3161	some people @MONTH1 disagree with me becuase they're one of these people being offended or not liking something	22
3360	3161	But say no to censorship, let our libraries do what there for, allow people to read, research, adn watch what the want.	23
3361	3162	Censorship is one of the most broken laws in @LOCATION1	0
3362	3162	It is illegal to censor any publication such as books, magazines, music or movies	1
3363	3162	Censorship most often occurs with books in a school setting	2
3364	3162	Censorship should no longer be tolerated because it affects the writers, school system and escpecially readers	3
3365	3162	In the @ORGANIZATION1 every person has the right to express their feelings and opinions on any topic that they want to	4
3366	3162	School systems are taking away that right by not allowing them to have a certain book in a school	5
3367	3162	Schools should be a place for either all books or a place for no books at all	6
3368	3162	The faculty of a school does not have the right to decide what books are allowed in their school based on their own ideals	7
3369	3162	It is not fair to the writer to be descriminated agianst, and that writer must have the right to have their book read in any setting	8
3370	3162	The next group that censorship within a school system affects is the school system itself	9
3371	3162	If a school is allowed to take away one right of a group of people without punishment, then they might start taking away other rights	10
3372	3162	In general school systems and teachers are power hugnry leaders of the student body of a school	11
3373	3162	They make rules just to display their power over students, and take away many of their rights	12
3374	3162	If schools are allowed to continue censoring books, then this could lead to a downward spiral of all being censored	13
3375	3162	As Katherine Paterson once said,'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children...take off the shelf	14
3376	3162	But if I have the right to remove the book I abhor...then you have exactly the same right...And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on school censorship because it is unconstitutional	15
3377	3162	The last major group of people that censorship within a school system is the potential readers and students	16
3378	3162	Censoring a book is taking that persons ability to learn about, and understand a certain topic that was censored	17
3379	3162	Students within a school must have the right to read what they want to read regardless of the schools beliefs and ideals	18
3380	3162	In conclusion, censorship in any setting, but escpecially in school must no longer be tolerated because it affects writers, school systems, and potential readers	19
3381	3162	Schools are taking away the constitutional right of all potential readers	20
3382	3162	The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on the unlawful practices occuring in schools, around the country, everyday	21
3383	3163	What is this world coming to	0
3384	3163	We have stooped to the level of installing offensive materials in libraries where anyone can check them out	1
3385	3163	Being a daughter and teenager myself, I personally have had the experience of reading some of these offensive books and magazines	2
3386	3163	The sex, drugs, and violence used to create a story, have destroyed the minds of our youth	3
3387	3163	I strongly feel this disturing and destructive material should be removed from the shelves of libraries	4
3388	3163	I do not question whether children and teens should read, but rather what they read	5
3389	3163	I agree reading helps our youth learn and excel in schooling, but offensive books and magazines put nasty ideas into their minds and distort their way of thinking	6
3390	3163	The more our younger generation reads about these ugly things, the more curious they become	7
3391	3163	I feel they will eventually let curiousity get the better of them	8
3392	3163	Many would say that experiencing activities such as sex and drugs is all apart of growing up, but I disagree	9
3393	3163	Trying any one of these harmful activites portrayed in certain library materials could put you and your health in severe danger	10
3394	3163	It only takes one time to become pregnant or become addicted to drugs	11
3395	3163	To better prove my point, think of your favorite book	12
3396	3163	Did you look up to any of the main characters	13
3397	3163	Did you want to be just like him/her	14
3398	3163	Well it seems to me that this malicious material makes the main character and hero of the story a bad role model	15
3399	3163	They @MONTH1 save the world and be a hero by day, but authors and producers make sure they include their night life in the story as well	16
3400	3163	This tells our children that it is okay to do these things, when it is the exact opposite	17
3401	3163	I stand by my opinion and believe offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries	18
3402	3163	This material plants a bad seed in the mind of our youth	19
3403	3163	It leads them to believe everyone, including their heros in books and movies, does these things	20
3404	3163	Sex, violence, and drugs are not what this world was made for	21
3405	3164	People think that graphic images or words are going to change the outlook there younger child has on alot of topics	0
3406	3164	But really the kids wont remember half of what they read or see so does it really matter	1
3407	3164	Well according to some people it does which i can understand but i will have to go with the side that it does'nt matter to	2
3408	3164	Becasue its not like there not going to find out about bad language or sex so i say there should be no restrictions on books, music, movies, magazines, tv shows, ect	3
3409	3164	The fact of the matter is that people or parents get to offended or complain cause there little @PERSON1 said a curse word in front of them	4
3410	3164	Or becasue some of the material in the show or magazines are to offensive towards people with disabilities, races, ect	5
3411	3164	When really all of this is just humor none of it is the network or authors being serious	6
3412	3164	Authors works arent to be shunned apon but to be read and for people to learn from that book or just have a good time reading it	7
3413	3164	Through all of this you should know by now that i don't think that books should be taken off the shelf just becasue little kids parents are ashamed of what there kid read	8
3414	3164	Casue like i already said there are gonna find out about this stuff eventually	9
3415	3164	So no need getting mad over it	10
3416	3164	And if we got rid of all the more mature books what  kind of books would all of us more mature kids and people have to read	11
3417	3164	Casue im pretty sure i dont want to read about a magical friendly dragon finding its way home.	12
3418	3165	Dear @CAPS1,      @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1	0
3419	3165	I am a student here at @LOCATION1, and it has come to @CAPS2 attention that the @ORGANIZATION1 is thinking about taking books they find offensive out of the library	1
3420	3165	I think this is wrong	2
3421	3165	If everybody at @LOCATION1 took the books we found offensive off the shelves and threw them away, we would be left with no books to read	3
3422	3165	I also think that no one person should have the right to decide what books are too offensive for me to read	4
3423	3165	I am sixteen years old and responsible enough to make @CAPS2 own decisions about what is too offensive for me to be reading	5
3424	3165	If I feel I should read books that others @MONTH1 find offensive then, why does that concern you	6
3425	3165	Just because I want to read the book does not mean you have to	7
3426	3165	Also, I think that having books that might be a little offensive makes that book more interesting	8
3427	3165	If you take every offensive word out of a book, chances are it is going to be hard to sit through it	9
3428	3165	If you take all offensive books from the library, kids will be even more discouraged about reading, and I know that is not what @LOCATION1 is looking to do	10
3429	3165	If you think that books are that offensive, try walking down the hallways	11
3430	3165	this is a @ORGANIZATION1	12
3431	3165	Kids cuss all the time, and talk about dirtier stuff than in any book I've ever read	13
3432	3165	If your looking to make children more innocent, then taking all ofour books out of the library is not the way to go about it	14
3433	3166	Every author has an intended audience when they are writing a book, and they write about what they think is appropriate for that certain audience	0
3434	3166	Unfortunately, sometimes other people that are not intended to read the book actually do read it even though it @MONTH1 not be something that they are supposed to be reading	1
3435	3166	When an author writes a childrens book, it is meant for a child to read, not an adult	2
3436	3166	Also when an author writes a romance novel, it is meant for people who can comprehend what the authr is talking about and can act maturely while reading it	3
3437	3166	Although some novels @MONTH1 not be appropriate for certain people, censorship in libraries is not they way to fix that, and it is a big mistake	4
3438	3166	As humans we are given certain freedoms, and one of those freedoms is the freedom of press	5
3439	3166	Authors should be able to write about whatever they choose to write about	6
3440	3166	If they choose to write about subject's that are not appropriate for all age groups they still have the right to have their books in libraries	7
3441	3166	Even though everyone isn't supposed to read them, certain people are	8
3442	3166	If you take those books away because your scared that a child might get ahold of one, then your taking away what certain people enjoy reading	9
3443	3166	Due to the fact that different books are intended for different age groups, libraries have different sections filled with a variety of authors	10
3444	3166	They have a children's section made primarily for children,an adult section with books that only adults are supposed to read and a teen section for everyone in between	11
3445	3166	By having sections within them, libraries are trying to keep people reading what they were intended to read without censoring or taking away people's favorite books	12
3446	3166	Having sections in libraries is a happy medium between letting anyone read whatever book they would like no matter how inappropriate it @MONTH1 be, and cutting out certain books all together	13
3447	3166	If a person is an adult, they should be allowed to go to the library and get whatever type of book, magazine, music, or movie that they want	14
3448	3166	If a kid's parent is okay with them checking out or looking at certain things then it shouldn't matter to anyone else if they think that the material is offensive	15
3449	3166	Instead of censoring what movies, books, magazines, or music that libraries have, there should be a certain age when someone can come in without a parent and check out whatever they would like	16
3450	3166	If a person is under that age then their parents should be present while they check out so they can approve of what their child is checking out	17
3451	3166	Censorship in libraries is ultimately pointless and shouldn't even be considered	18
3452	3166	Whether some people find certain material offensive or not, there are other ways to get that material so there really is no point to censoring anything in libraries	19
3453	3167	I think that all offensive materials should be removed from librarys so every one can read a book listen to music and watch movies with out being offended	0
3454	3167	They shuld have there own section for that kind of material	1
3455	3167	Movies that are bad should be taken off the shelf	2
3456	3167	They should have a section just for those movies	3
3457	3167	The sction should be locked up so children can't get those movies	4
3458	3167	I think that this would be fair for everyone	5
3459	3167	Music that is bad should be taken off the shelf	6
3460	3167	They should have a section just for that kind of music	7
3461	3167	The section should be locked up so children can't get that kind of music	8
3462	3167	I think that this would be fair for everyone	9
3463	3167	Magazines that are bad should be taken off the shelf	10
3464	3167	These magazines should have a section just for those magazines	11
3465	3167	They should be locked up	12
3466	3167	I Think that this would be fair for every one	13
3467	3167	Books that are bad should be taken off the shelf	14
3468	3167	They should have a secton just for these books	15
3469	3167	these books should be locked up so children cant get them	16
3470	3167	I think that this would be fair for everyone	17
3471	3167	This is what I think should be done with this offensive materials	18
3472	3167	If this was done everyone would have a book to read  a magazine to look at music to listen to and a movie to watch	19
3473	3168	Picture this: you come home one day after work and before you even enter the house, you hear music blaring from your child's room	0
3474	3168	As you step closer, you begin to hear the lyrics that go with the banging bass and you realize that that isn't just any music, it's completely unedited, expicit versions of vulgar songs	1
3475	3168	Now, who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking, doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay	2
3476	3168	I know I sure wouldn't	3
3477	3168	Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society	4
3478	3168	It can be found nearly anywhere	5
3479	3168	In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it	6
3480	3168	All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages	7
3481	3168	That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree	8
3482	3168	By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age	9
3483	3168	Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world	10
3484	3168	There should just be a limitation on who can view it	11
3485	3168	That applies to everything that could contain offensive material	12
3486	3168	Kids are kids	13
3487	3168	There are certain things that should be absolutely off limits to them--such as explicit movies, books, music, etc.--as they do not need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at such a young age	14
3488	3168	Censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be	15
3489	3168	But, as mentioned earlier, censorship should only be to a certain degree	16
3490	3168	Keeping childrens' minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general	17
3491	3169	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is such a strong statement by Katherine Paterson in regards to censorship in libraries	0
3492	3169	So often today do we hear of books, magazines, and numerous other resources in libraries being banned because of unpopular views	1
3493	3169	A classic novel, The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4, has been removed from the shelves of many public and school libraries because of crude language such as the word 'nigger'	2
3494	3169	Libraries should not take resources off their shelves due to offensiveness because it goes against the library's purpose and because many people have different views	3
3495	3169	A library is a place with resources provided for information, interest, and enlightnement	4
3496	3169	When a book or magazine is taken away because of origin, background, or views that seem obscene or unpopular, then that library isn't serving its purpose	5
3497	3169	If I wanted to find a book on @CAPS5 but the library banned it because another religion found its teachings offensive, then why not ban the other religion's books as well	6
3498	3169	@CAPS1 goes back to what was said by Katherine Paterson earlier	7
3499	3169	What might be offensive to one person could be a lifestyle or interest to another	8
3500	3169	Children, however, should be treated as a special case	9
3501	3169	No, a child should probably not, in my opinion, be reading about adult things such as sex	10
3502	3169	However, that child's parent or guardian is the only one who has the right to restrict resources they feel as inapropriate	11
3503	3169	In most public libraries, young children are not aloud to roam the library without an adult	12
3504	3169	@CAPS1 is a very prominant rule because it sets boudaries for the adolescent so they are not to read about or listen to anything they shouldn't	13
3505	3169	Also, it is keen that libraries divide up the different resources into separate sections for children, young adults, and adults	14
3506	3169	Banning books and such from libraries takes away a part of history and leaves a gap for the future	15
3507	3169	To find that what our parents were once reading is restricted should not be an issue	16
3508	3169	Materials should not be censored in libraries beacuse they are found offensive becuase @CAPS1 is censorship and it takes away our rights.	17
3509	3170	I dont think we should not take books, Music, Movies, and Magazines off the shelf gets because we think they are offensive to us	0
3510	3170	If you think somthing is offensive dont get it I know I would not get somthing that I think is offensive to me	1
3511	3170	Their lot's of books in the world that i dont like	2
3512	3170	One of them is @CAPS1 Books I hate them with all of my heart	3
3513	3170	The next kind of books that I think is offensive is @CAPS2 Books because their are lots of story that are in their that we dont read	4
3514	3170	So I think that it is a wast of paper	5
3515	3170	The last kind of books I think is offensive is @CAPS3 Books because they are hard to read them in @CAPS3	6
3516	3170	Their are lot's of music out there I dont like	7
3517	3170	One of them is @CAPS5	8
3518	3170	I dont know why I dislike @CAPS5 but I do	9
3519	3170	The next type @CAPS6- @CAPS7	10
3520	3170	The singer in todays @CAPS6- @CAPS7 I think are no good	11
3521	3170	The last type of music is some of todays rap	12
3522	3170	I think some of todays rap uses to much bad words	13
3523	3170	Their are lot's of movies out their I dont like	14
3524	3170	The first one is @CAPS10 @CAPS11	15
3525	3170	I did not get the hole plut of that movie	16
3526	3170	The next one @CAPS12 of the corn	17
3527	3170	Their was no way I could find out way the @CAPS12 was killing the people over @NUM1 in that town	18
3528	3170	The last movie that I did not like was ALL the @CAPS13 movies	19
3529	3170	I just did not like them ok	20
3530	3170	I think all of these things are offensive	21
3531	3170	But I still know that people like them so I would not take them away	22
3532	3170	There are thing people like but I dont like them	23
3533	3170	Their things that my friend like but I dont like	24
3534	3170	Their thing I like and they dont like	25
3535	3170	But I guess what I am trying to say is in life there are going to be things that you dont like	26
3536	3170	But you cant get rid of the things you dislike in the world	27
3537	3171	Our founding fathers creating amendments for the people	0
3538	3171	One of the greatest is the freedom of speech	1
3539	3171	Censorship of offessive materials is unnecessary	2
3540	3171	Books, music, movies, and magazines @MONTH1 have bad messages or nudity, but that does not give anyone the right to get rid of them	3
3541	3171	Book burning happened because of the dislike of people's writing	4
3542	3171	People have the right to say how they feel by any medium	5
3543	3171	Censorship of anything makes a child more immature	6
3544	3171	Book burning is a horrible action by any person	7
3545	3171	People used to burn them because of all the sex, drugs, and violence, but doing this destroys people's dreams, theories, and ideas	8
3546	3171	In the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, firemen would burn any book seen within a home	9
3547	3171	Almost ever single book in the world is not factual, unless it is nonfiction	10
3548	3171	The firemen in the novel destroyed any bits of type because it was false and went against the government	11
3549	3171	That basically means every kind of book out there	12
3550	3171	The causation of such a tragedy was that every citizen befriended their television or video games	13
3551	3171	Without books there would be no real sort of entertainment	14
3552	3171	Also, the things we read everyday are what make us who we are so there, in fact, should not be less books but more	15
3553	3171	Libraries have no right to censor books	16
3554	3171	Freedom of speech has been around almost since the beginning of this nation	17
3555	3171	Why should it change now	18
3556	3171	Stopping obscene literature from being in the reach of the people is stopping writers from speaking out	19
3557	3171	They @MONTH1 have already written their ideas, but if nobody reads their work then there is no way that they'll be heard	20
3558	3171	Libraries are not there to stop things from reaching little kids' ears but to provide any knowledge a man needs	21
3559	3171	Parents have always stopped their precious babies from watching certain shows and movies	22
3560	3171	I once knew a woman who would never allow her son to watch the @PERSON1 series because of the use of sorcery	23
3561	3171	She believed that he would try to learn witchcraft	24
3562	3171	I found that quite ridiculous when I heard about it	25
3563	3171	When a kid watches murder mysteries, fantasy shows, or dramas with bits of nudity, it is different to them and they are curious	26
3564	3171	After watching these kind of scenes, a parent needs to sit down with their child and talk about what they jus saw	27
3565	3171	The child needs to know that killing is wrong and justice is good and magic and dragons don't exist	28
3566	3171	Nudity has always been considered a bad thing but penises and boobs are part of the human body	29
3567	3171	Kids will be more mature about it the more they see it, but that doesn't the child should watch porn	30
3568	3171	Censory has always been taken the wrong way	31
3569	3171	People believe if that the offensive material is shown then the watcher or reader will have bad thoughts about what they learned about	32
3570	3171	We should not get rid of the obscenity at all	33
3571	3171	We should have an understanding of the bad things in life	34
3572	3171	Burning books is a bad way to destroy the foundations of the human mind	35
3573	3171	Freedom of speech is a law and should be followed	36
3574	3171	Censorship is not always a good thing for children or anyone for that matter	37
3575	3172	Should books, magazines, movies, and music be put in higher reaches of children, or should they be left in plain sight	0
3576	3172	Is @CAPS5 fair to not be capable to see a movie, magazine, or even read a book because others in the area believe @CAPS5's offensive in their view	1
3577	3172	If an adult is reading a specific book or magazine and they feel @CAPS5's only for their eyes to see @CAPS5 then they should keep that item in a personal place that only he or she knows, not anyone else	2
3578	3172	Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	3
3579	3172	The reason for this is because, @CAPS5's not fair to others who haven't read them, and who would like to read them, but can't because they have been removed to others oppinions	4
3580	3172	If the books and magazines weren't appropriate for children then the companies wouldn't print them and releasr them to stands for them to be sold	5
3581	3172	If certain music also wasn't appropriate then music producers wouldn't let artists release that song out on a track	6
3582	3172	There are many chances for school projects that @MONTH1 require getting information, but the student who is assigned to get @CAPS5 is not able to, due to the fact that adults think the website @MONTH1 be inappropriate	7
3583	3172	For example, in history class a student is assigned an assignment to get done over the @DATE2 about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for a grade	8
3584	3172	@DATE3 comes and he/she doesn't have @CAPS5 and gets a @CAPS4 for the homework he/she was assigned	9
3585	3172	The student explains why he/she wasn't able to get any information	10
3586	3172	He/she starts explaing themself by saying 'the websites I went to were blocked	11
3587	3172	The books and magazines I tried checking out were either thrown out, or I wasn't able to check them out.' '@CAPS5's all because our neighbors who live in this neighborhood think the pictures and words are offensive, and since then the librarians stopped putting them out on shelves.'      The teacher then says, 'well then I will go and sign out a book for you and you can try and get as much information out as you can, how does that sound to you?' '@CAPS6 good, at least @CAPS5's better then getting an @CAPS4 on the assignment,' said the student	12
3588	3172	@DATE1 @TIME1 comes, adn the student has as much information he/she was able to get out of the two books, and hands @CAPS5 to the teacher	13
3589	3172	At the end of class @CAPS5 gets graded and the grade on @CAPS5 turns out to be a @CAPS8	14
3590	3172	Student is happy for picking up the grade but is still unhappy he/she wasn't able to get the items they needed from the start	15
3591	3172	This is why movies, books, magazines, or even music should not be removed from shelves	16
3592	3172	Things like this will probably happen, and the kids will land up getting in trouble for not having the assignment turned in which is not even their fault	17
3593	3172	If only a few citizens have oppinions about certain items and they feel that those items should be removed, then they should be from their sight, and they shouldn't bother thinking of them	18
3594	3172	Even if @CAPS5's for safety of the children they @MONTH1 have in the house with them, then they shouldn't even have the books out of the little private personal spot where nobody knows of excpet for that one particular person.	19
3595	3173	Bad @CAPS1 in @DATE1's @CAPS2      Libraries are a great place to learn about many thing, from earths history to where will we be in the future	0
3596	3173	I think somethings should not be on the shelves of a library because some books can be found very offensive to some people	1
3597	3173	Even movies and music can be offensive to some people	2
3598	3173	I think the music of @DATE1 is a big problem because the lyrics can be very offensive	3
3599	3173	Movies are not a huge issue but they can be at times	4
3600	3173	There are many reasons movies can be offensive	5
3601	3173	If they are offensive why put them in the libraries	6
3602	3173	Well the libraries just want to make money so they do not care about offensive products	7
3603	3173	For example a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movie that is inaccurrate and poorly made might be offensive to real life @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 veterans	8
3604	3173	The veterans then might want the movie taken of the shelves	9
3605	3173	I have seen some great @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movies but I have also see some bad ones too	10
3606	3173	My grandpa was a veteran and he saw a bad @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and got so upset he cursed at the @CAPS15 and almost threw the remote at it	11
3607	3173	Then ther is the problem with the music of @DATE1	12
3608	3173	I do not think stores including libraries should sell albums of @DATE1's rap artists because all the talk about is drugs, sex, and girls	13
3609	3173	If you ask me its stupid	14
3610	3173	But when you start selling them in a library there is something wrong with that librariy	15
3611	3173	Some country singers can be like that to because all the sing about is getting drunk then having sex	16
3612	3173	I just think the most of the music of @DATE1 is really pointless and a waste of time because when I listen to it I think this is stupid and makes no sinces	17
3613	3173	Books can be offensive sometimes it just depends on the writer	18
3614	3173	Books with a lot of cursing can be offensive to religions groups who are forbidden to curse or read curse words	19
3615	3173	Why put it on the shelves of libraries then	20
3616	3173	Well it all lead back to money	21
3617	3173	If people buy the books that mean the libraries get money and the more books people buy the richer the libraries becomes	22
3618	3173	I read a book that was about some one killing cats and I found that offensive because I love cats I would never hurt them	23
3619	3173	I got really mad when I read it so I threw it down the took it to the library and complained to them	24
3620	3173	So over all the libraries should be more carefull on what they put on the shelves for people to buy	25
3621	3173	If the libraries but the wrong things on the shelves they might end up in a law suit	26
3622	3173	But if they do not put offensive things on the shelves they will not end up being in a law suit	27
3623	3174	I do believe that some places have magizines, books, movies, and music that need to be removed from all shelfs	0
3624	3174	Just think, if you had childern would you want them getting ahold of a magizine with nude men or women in it	1
3625	3174	Yes people tell you they have control of there kids in stores, but i know you see kids all the time walking away or roming off to try to do what they want, and go to places they shouldnt be like magizines for instence	2
3626	3174	Would you want to find your little one looking at a magizine with nude wemon in it	3
3627	3174	Thats not the things kids should be finding in stores, its not nessacary	4
3628	3174	Same deal goes with movies, say you rent a movie from one of your many movie places and it has nudity or cursing in it, do want that around your kids	5
3629	3174	i know i wouldnt, cause kids are like monkeys, monkey see monkey do, and you dont want your little one walking aroud cussing at you	6
3630	3174	I have little cousins and ive seen it happen many times where they cuss back at there parents, and when the parents ask them where they heard that its usually the same answer, tv or movies	7
3631	3174	So do you really think it's nessacary to have all that bad stuff around for anyone, of many ages to see	8
3632	3174	It's not	9
3633	3174	Everything like that just needs to be taken off all shelf and destoryed, cause I shouldnt have to see it and niether should anyone else, its gross, nasty, and inrepropriet to childern	10
3634	3174	I say get read of it all and do everyone a favor	11
3635	3175	Libraries contain many different selections of books, music, and magazines	0
3636	3175	However, are all of these materials appropriate for all @CAPS1 visitors	1
3637	3175	In this essay I will explain to you why I think offensive, distracting and inappropraite material should be removed off of the shelves, and put into their own section of public @CAPS2	2
3638	3175	If a small child were to walk into a public @CAPS1 and pick up a book about abortions, they would not know what the book is talking about, because most small children cannot read	3
3639	3175	What if a fifth grader was to pick that same book up	4
3640	3175	They would be able to read  the whole thing with no problems	5
3641	3175	However, should a fifth grader be allowed to pick up a book about abortions at such a young age	6
3642	3175	I dont think so, fifth graders should be reading age appropriate books	7
3643	3175	This is just one reason why I think offensive, distracting and inappropriate material should be moved to its own section of the @CAPS1	8
3644	3175	When I think of a @CAPS1 I think of a quiet place that I can go to and read, or study	9
3645	3175	Although, some Libraries allow their visitors to listen to music	10
3646	3175	Rather it be on a computer, on a ipod, or even on a cell phone, there should be a sound limit right	11
3647	3175	Most people would think that Libraries set sound limits, and they probably do, but people do not follow directions and they are not attentive to what other people are doing	12
3648	3175	It is @CAPS6 distracting to go into a @CAPS1, to study, and the person next to you has their ipod blasted to a heavy metal rock song	13
3649	3175	Once again, this is another reason I think offensive, distracting, and inappropriate material should be moved to its own area of the @CAPS1	14
3650	3175	I also think that a @CAPS1 is a community place, that you can go to and be safe, and your parents would not have to go with you because they think that it is safe and appropriate too	15
3651	3175	Most Libraries have magazines, because its for your entertainment, and they want to keep you happy so you will keep coming back	16
3652	3175	Well not all magazines are rated @CAPS10, some have @CAPS6 inappropriate material in them	17
3653	3175	A child should be looking at magazines that are appropriate for children, a teenager should be looking at magazines that are for teenagers, and an adult should be looking at magazines for adults	18
3654	3175	However the adult magazines should not be showing people with barely any clothes on, or any sexual scenes, and neither should teenage magazines	19
3655	3175	With innapropriate magazines, I do not think they should have their own section of the @CAPS1, I think they should be removed all together	20
3656	3175	They have pictures in them and anyone can look at a picture	21
3657	3175	I really hope you can understand my point of view	22
3658	3175	It is nothing against public Libraries, it is just the material inside of them	23
3659	3175	If I owned a public @CAPS1, I would have rooms devoted to books that are for different age groups	24
3660	3175	For example, I would have a room for @NUM1+, and a room for @NUM2+	25
3661	3175	Those rooms would be for the books that are easily questionable for younger children	26
3662	3175	I would also have my own room devoted for music only	27
3663	3175	That way anyone could go in the room and listen to whatever kind of music they want, no questions asked	28
3664	3175	The rest of the @CAPS1 would be for people to study, and read	29
3665	3175	I think every @CAPS1 should be like this, it would help make the world a better place	30
3666	3176	Hello, my name is @CAPS1 and I think that books, newspapers, and magazines being censored should be done but shouldn't	0
3667	3176	When I say that I mean that some books dealing with adventure or romance might have parts that need to be censored, but thats how the author made the book	1
3668	3176	It was meant to catch your attention right off the first sentence of the story	2
3669	3176	I believe that sometimes magazines need to be censored because they are promoting bad habits for people all across the @LOCATION1 and other people around the world	3
3670	3176	Magazines in my opinion should be censored	4
3671	3176	Now some make it to where there less inaproperate which is somewhat a good thing, but others pretty much just let it slide and figure it will raise the sales by how ever much percent they want it to be considering what they put in the magazine	5
3672	3176	I feel that books should stay on the shelf however	6
3673	3176	Some people feel that the 'censored' parts of the story are really what catches there attention	7
3674	3176	I myself have never had an expirence in this field because im not one to be a strong reader, but knowing how other people are, I would suggest that we censor some things, but not all	8
3675	3176	People write books all the time dealing with something that has happened in their lifetime or something from their imagination	9
3676	3176	So we can't really help what people think about and what some people write down to be published in a book	10
3677	3176	For some readers, it is a very interesting story or passage being read from the back cover of the book, while others just want the book gone from there neighborhood library or out of their house	11
3678	3176	It all really depends on the reader	12
3679	3176	If I could, there would be things I would censor, but not in books	13
3680	3176	It was their idea to put it in the story but some things need to be left unsaid	14
3681	3176	Some readers appriciate it, while others do not	15
3682	3176	It is really their choice to read the book and if its not appealing to them they can simply put it back on the shelf and find another close to it	16
3683	3176	I just feel that some magazines should be censored	17
3684	3176	Constantly, you see swimsuit models and 'sexual appeal' in magazines everyday when you enter the grocery store or library	18
3685	3176	I just do not think it is right for little kids to see that when there looking for a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 book or a book about their favorite animal	19
3686	3176	Another reason to censor magazines would be because of some religious views on what people see when they look at the magazine	20
3687	3176	People everyday become @CAPS4 and being right with @CAPS5, so people will take offense to some of the disturbing images in magazines	21
3688	3176	I myself as a @CAPS6 take offense to some of these magazines, promoting being perfect and having the life sucked out of you as you read each passage	22
3689	3176	As I have said, I am to the understanding of the books having what they have in them, because of the authors imagination, but some magazines just need to be thrown off the shelf	23
3690	3178	We all enjoy having the freedom to read, listen, and watch what we like	0
3691	3178	How would you feel if that freedom was taken away from you	1
3692	3178	Some people believe that censored books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries	2
3693	3178	I believe you should have the right to read, listen, and watch whatever you choose, but children should talk to their parents about it first if it is a censored material	3
3694	3178	We all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read, see, or listen to	4
3695	3178	That does not mean that the item should be removed completely though	5
3696	3178	Instead, the child should talk to a parent about the censored item	6
3697	3178	The parent can decide if the child is mature enough for the item	7
3698	3178	Also, if those materials are removed from libraries completely, someone that is mature enough to be reading, listening, or seeing it will not have a chance to	8
3699	3178	I remember when I was in middle school, I really wanted to read @PERSON1 novels that I saw at the library	9
3700	3178	My mother believed that I should not read those novels at that age	10
3701	3178	My mother and I worked out a compromise that I could read @PERSON1 novels that she approved of	11
3702	3178	She said when I was older, I could read any of @PERSON1's novels that I wanted	12
3703	3178	I found this compromise to be very fair	13
3704	3178	I knew that when I was old enough to read those novels, they would still be there on the shelf waiting for me	14
3705	3178	We should have the right to read, listen, and watch what we enjoy, but younger children or other age groups should be monitored	15
3706	3178	That does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though	16
3707	3178	When those children are old enough to read, watch, or listen to those materials, they should be able to go to the library, knowing it will be there on the shelf waiting for them.	17
3708	3179	Do you believe that certian materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
3709	3179	No, no i do not	1
3710	3179	it is one thing to censor a book or movie, but to completley remove it is another	2
3711	3179	I feel like authors, artists, musicians, and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want	3
3712	3179	Regardless of who is reading it	4
3713	3179	I feel like censorship is wrong	5
3714	3179	Authors should be able to feel free to express there thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like	6
3715	3179	some times storys cannot be explained or told the way it needs to be without certain words	7
3716	3179	Wether those words be good or bad i feel like with out them the book that is being read is not all of what it could of been	8
3717	3179	in my oppionion censorship takes away from certain values or qualitys the book could of had with the original context still in it	9
3718	3179	and to me that is not fair	10
3719	3179	its not fair to the author	11
3720	3179	and is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book	12
3721	3179	I know from my personal expierences with reading books that 'yes' i have read books that have had bad language in them	13
3722	3179	but just because a book has one or two bad words in it does not mean that it should be completley taken off the shelf	14
3723	3179	For example the book '@CAPS1' @CAPS2: @PERSON1 was an amazing book	15
3724	3179	I probably enjoyed that book more than i have any other book that i have ever read in my entire life	16
3725	3179	But that book would not be nearly as good as it was with it being scensored or taken off the shelf for that matter	17
3726	3179	All i am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it	18
3727	3179	because that is getting away from what the over all message is about	19
3728	3179	Your almost taking the words out of context when you do this	20
3729	3179	Do i believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive	21
3730	3179	No i do not	22
3731	3179	Neither should you	23
3732	3180	Sexual conduct, language, and criminal behavior are three big things in my school, and community	0
3733	3180	Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are all about those three things	1
3734	3180	If they are in our libraries, how can teachers and administration keep us from it during school	2
3735	3180	I think the censorship of some movies, magazines, and especially music should be highly discussed, and more strict	3
3736	3180	We do not really have a lot of movies in our school library, but I do know that there are some in the town library	4
3737	3180	Parents and adults do not want us growing up so fast, and yet they allow sexual, crude language movies to be on the shelves of libraries	5
3738	3180	If it is such a big deal, I think they need to be removed	6
3739	3180	I'm a big believer on the fact that if it happens, it is going to happen no matter @CAPS1 precautions are taken	7
3740	3180	But with that said, we can still take the needed precautions to keep it from kids that are too yound to see them, like under the age of @NUM1	8
3741	3180	It is not just movies that we have to worry about though	9
3742	3180	@ORGANIZATION1 is a magazine that is devoted to giving their readers tips on sex, problems with their sex lives, and the occassional '@CAPS1 to wear this @DATE1!' articles	10
3743	3180	I will say that I have read this magazine, but it doesn't appeal to my interests	11
3744	3180	Some kids today though, are very attentive to those subjects	12
3745	3180	Again, that goes back to the problem of kids growing up too fast	13
3746	3180	I have noticed in my school alone, that it is a rapidly growing problem	14
3747	3180	If magazines like this weren't on the shelves for us to see whenever we enter a library, maybe we would not be as keen to the idea	15
3748	3180	If we were not introduced to it so early, we would not be going behind our parents' backs trying to do it	16
3749	3180	@ORGANIZATION1, and other magazines like it, needs to be taken off the shelves as soon as possible	17
3750	3180	Music is a world-wide phenomenon	18
3751	3180	Say a child around the age of @NUM2 is listening to the new @CAPS2' @PERSON1 song	19
3752	3180	He is being introduces to crude language, sexual behavior, and criminal acts in the @NUM3 minute time period it takes to listen to the full song	20
3753	3180	Seriously, it only takes that long for a child to be introduced, and it is only one song out of the thousands that are out there	21
3754	3180	This music is able to be accessed on many computers, especially in public, town libraries	22
3755	3180	We are not allowed to act like that in school, and if we are going to be spending @NUM4 of our childhood/teenage years here, why let us listen to it	23
3756	3180	If you walk into a library, all you have to do is sign your name, the date, and the time you got there to access a computer	24
3757	3180	After that, they can not tell you to get off of it, unless you are violating the law or looking up something not age appropriate	25
3758	3180	Music does not fall into that category	26
3759	3180	It, too needs to be taken away if the language, sexual conduct, and criminal behavior messages are adult rated	27
3760	3180	I, personally, love magazines, movies, and music	28
3761	3180	They are my three m's and I live by them	29
3762	3180	But not the ones that are going to get me in trouble, put wrong messages in my head, or cause me (subconciously) do participate in a criminal act	30
3763	3180	I always allow my mother or father to read books, listen to music, and watch movies with me	31
3764	3180	If they are not pleased with @CAPS1 it is, I will not do it behind their back	32
3765	3180	The censorship in libraries needs to be more strict	33
3766	3180	If it were more strict, it would keep our younger children from growing up to fast and keep teens from participating in criminal acts	34
3767	3180	The censorship in libraries is an ongoing problem and it needs to be fixed.	35
3768	3181	The diversity of the world makes it rather difficult to please every person all of the time	0
3769	3181	What I find appropreate, another @MONTH1 find obscene and volgur	1
3770	3181	What I enjoy to read, or listen to, or watch, or any other manner of media consumption I indulge in, @MONTH1 insult or bother someone else	2
3771	3181	as a matter of fact it probably does	3
3772	3181	That still does not make it right to remove what I, or others like because it offends another person	4
3773	3181	A child walks through a grocery store, doesn't get what they want and proceeds to drop the f-bomb	5
3774	3181	More than half the time, they heard that language from their parents	6
3775	3181	If not their parents, then the media right	7
3776	3181	Maybe so, but that media shouldn't be hidden for the 'just-in-case' a child hears it	8
3777	3181	If a parent or guardian does not want their child to hear such things, they shouldn't allow them to listen to it	9
3778	3181	They control what does and does not enter their house	10
3779	3181	To remove such things from the library, would be like trying to keep a child from ever seeing a naked body, or hearing a curse word	11
3780	3181	Every time they bathe they'd need blinders from themselves and they'd never be able to leave their house, because people do not always watch what they say in public	12
3781	3181	No, I do not feel like every type of movie, or book, etc., belongs in the library	13
3782	3181	There is a cut-off as to how inapropreate or volgure something should be and still be allowed in a public library	14
3783	3181	Novels that are so descriptive that the reader can almost see every aspect of the procreation taking place between the pages, should have its own place, seperate from the public library, right along with the movies that really do show every aspect	15
3784	3181	Although I like the thought, to actually remove said books would be unfair	16
3785	3181	To deny access to those who find those books fine for themselves wouyld be wrong	17
3786	3181	A wise author, Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	18
3787	3181	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	19
3788	3181	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The truth of this statement would not be hard to prove	20
3789	3181	A religious family that believes @PERSON2, a book I find to be innocent fantasy, is a book series promoting witchcraft and satanism, so they remove them from the library	21
3790	3181	I remove the previously stated graphic romance novels	22
3791	3181	A mother whom wants her child to be sheltered from what she considers the filth of the planet, removes books of drug addicts, and abuse, and books of war because they're full of death	23
3792	3181	And as this continues, finally, we are left with the empty shelfs of a forgotten building that no longer has a purpose	24
3793	3181	The graphic novels I find inapropreate could be placed in an adult section, or higher up than most children can reach	25
3794	3181	The protective parents can deny their own children the media they deem inappropreate, instead of the world	26
3795	3181	Although not everything is appropreate for everyone, it isn't right to censor something from the world	27
3796	3181	There are ways to cencor things to parts and not others	28
3797	3181	Nothing should be romoved from the library because of its content	29
3798	3181	At most it should be placed in a less accessable manner.	30
3799	3183	What is consitered offensive	0
3800	3183	If we took books, music, movies and magazines that people found offensive of shelfs there would be nothing left	1
3801	3183	Everyone is diffrent which mean they all get offended in diffrent ways	2
3802	3183	By taking all this off shelfs we would be providing a smaller education for students around the world	3
3803	3183	Things we learn about in school, slavery, wars and some pollitics	4
3804	3183	Now all these things could offend many people but if we were to take them of off the shelfs at school and libraries children will have no idea about history or what is going on in the current world	5
3805	3183	What about drugs and alchol, many parents do not talk to their childern about the uses of controlled substances, so without these sources they @MONTH1 never know the harm that they can do to someones body	6
3806	3183	Everyone takes something offensive but not everyone takes the same thing offensive	7
3807	3183	So who is to say what offends people and what does not	8
3808	3183	If thats the case shouldn't we take all books, movies, music and magazines away from childrens schools and libraries	9
3809	3183	Adults get offended to so would we take all of their resources away also including the newspaper	10
3810	3183	By taking away what one @MONTH1 call offensive @MONTH1 land us in the dark ages with no books, no local news, no movies, no nothing because not one person can say what the whole world considers offensive	11
3811	3183	Everyone has the right to read and write what they want	12
3812	3183	No one can say what offends everyone	13
3813	3183	Someone @MONTH1 get offended by talking about ones race, another @MONTH1 get offended by talking about @CAPS1 and someone @MONTH1 even get offended if you talk about their cute little kitty cat	14
3814	3183	Everyone looks at everythings diffrently	15
3815	3183	So why try and control us all as one	16
3816	3183	All people think diffrent and they know what they want to read, hear and watch all by them selfs, they don't need someone to tell them.	17
3817	3184	Censorship should only be used for areas in which young children are exposed to, suchs as schools and tv shows intended for young children	0
3818	3184	Things that aren't intendend for young children should not be censored	1
3819	3184	If you were to censore everything because some people find it offensive then we would never be able to find new ideas to improve our community	2
3820	3184	Censoring books, moives, magazines, and music that aren't intended for young people is a wast of time	3
3821	3184	If you were to take a book off a shelf that explaind the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 because a person found it offensive then we would never make advansis in technology	4
3822	3184	Cenosoring items like books is just plane idiotic and ignorant	5
3823	3184	Studing matireal is our only way to advance in seiance, and if we can't get the right books to studie because they were taken off the shelf due to it being offensive then we will never make brakethoughs in technology	6
3824	3184	Parents that feel that books, movies, and magazines should be censored really arent good parents	7
3825	3184	If they really were consurend with thouse topics then they shouldn't buy them the moives or the books that they find offensive	8
3826	3184	It seems that parents want to proclaim they want to censore that items because they find it offensive	9
3827	3184	But not all parents feel the same way, some parents are open with their children about these topics and feel that their chilren are mature enough to handle things like these	10
3828	3184	As a child I wasn't shielded from these kinds of situations	11
3829	3184	I grew up with out censoreship	12
3830	3184	I wacthed movies and read book that were never censored, and I was mature enough to know what it all ment	13
3831	3184	I see why parents want to censore that kids from topics like thouse, but they never take the time to talk to their children about these topic and see if that are mature enough to hanld it	14
3832	3184	Censoreship is great for childrens tv shows	15
3833	3184	But when you start to censore someones ideas because you find them offensive and wrong then you are being ignorant	16
3834	3184	People here have freedom of speech and desirve the right to not have there work censored because a small group finds it offensive	17
3835	3184	Censoreship is a great tool, if used right	18
3836	3185	Book Censorship	0
3837	3185	Should books be censored	1
3838	3185	This a national problem about the contents of books	2
3839	3185	It is a big deal	3
3840	3185	What one parent feels is very offensive another @MONTH1 feel it has a necessary life lesson that their children need to learn	4
3841	3185	If you ask me thaqt question I would say, '@CAPS1 I believe the books should ,but to a national scale and not a community one.'@CAPS2 this I mean a book with things like references to nudity or other things of volgur nature ,not just because it has a bad word in it that a parent feels to be inappropiate for their child	5
3842	3185	I believe there should be a national rating system for books like there is in the movie industry	6
3843	3185	Also i believe that it is the parents' job to regulate what their children read	7
3844	3185	If they believe the book is vulgar or inappropiate but the system don't then you need to prevent their children from reading it without taking it off the shelf	8
3845	3185	It is the parents' job to regulate the reading of their children not the contents of the bookshelf	9
3846	3185	Like in Katherine Paterson's @CAPS3 ' All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any children have taken off the shelf	10
3847	3185	But if I had the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 this I believe she means that if we all took a book of the shelves for our children there would be no books because what is not offensive to you @MONTH1 be very offensive to another parent	11
3848	3185	So the parents should leave it on the shelf and prevent their own kids from reading it and let the other parents worry about their own kids	12
3849	3185	@CAPS1 I believe in a goverment censorship program but to an extent	13
3850	3185	It is the parents' job to regulate the readings of their children ,but they do not need to regulate the contents of the bookshelf	14
3851	3187	The media is a way for some people to get out and reach others	0
3852	3187	Whether it is a magazine, movie etc everyone in the world is going to see it some way or another	1
3853	3187	If that piece of work isn't seen as acceptable from many peoples point of views it shouldn't be available to the public	2
3854	3187	I personally beleive that if something is seen as volgure and offence it shouldnt be displayed	3
3855	3187	Millions of people will be viewing this and I wouldn't want my kid looking at it	4
3856	3187	Why would anyone else want the opposite	5
3857	3187	Kids pay attention to detail really well and something so negative could change the mindset of the child	6
3858	3187	We all want to bring our kids up right and letting them have availabilty to negative material is uncalled for	7
3859	3187	Its not only kids either that are affected, adults also are affected by the media	8
3860	3187	Adults can get fooled too, beleive me	9
3861	3187	I remember one time that there were books and magazines at my school that were being taken off shelves for this exact same reason	10
3862	3187	I beleive that what the librarians did was right	11
3863	3187	Some kids in the school shouldn't be viewing or reading about unacceptable things	12
3864	3187	Some students @MONTH1 not have matured enough and can take something in a different view than another student	13
3865	3187	I beleive that if something is taken off a shelf because it doesn't seem appropriate enough I stand for whoever it is that did it	14
3866	3187	Nothing with a negative affect on a person should be viewed by an innocent child	15
3867	3187	There should be a positive affect on the child at all times so he or she is brought up to the best of its abilities	16
3868	3188	I think that they should remove books, and take away more stuff from the kids now a days, because they are getting worse in worse like everyday, i think they should move the @NUM1 to @NUM2, so atleast they are old enough to read, hear, or watch whatever they want, but they should go through and do a self-check on everything that they put out  in the stores.They should also have different parts in a library so that the little ones dont get to the adult section, such as adult books, that have stuff in them about sex, drugs, or anything else that falls under that catagory	0
3869	3188	I have @NUM3 little brothers, and they are @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6	1
3870	3188	They know more stuff then my parents, and its because now a days kids pick up on stuff a lot more easier	2
3871	3188	So i say we as in the @LOCATION1 citizens need to watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can get a hold of	3
3872	3188	When i was growing-up i didnt know as much as my little brothers do today, and that is because everyday they are coming out with something else everyday that can effect our kids, brothers, or whoever	4
3873	3188	I also do think the schools should have a class about the stuff that kids are experiencing in todays life, in like elementary school, so that when they get older they will already know about the drugs, or the sex life	5
3874	3188	Kids also remember stuff a lot more when they are growing up, so if we put it in there heads at a really really young age, they will remember it	6
3875	3188	Im not saying that kids will stop doing what they are doing, but atleast the percent population will go down, and parents will be a lot more happier	7
3876	3188	I also think that parents should stop lying to there kids about sex, making up stories so that there kid wont know, they need to stop doing that because they are going to find out about it sooner or later, so why not now	8
3877	3188	they whould be more aware of the real life in how it is out there, so all the parents out there should not lie to there kids about the sex life	9
3878	3188	So thats what my person input is on the situation	10
3879	3188	I wish this would change sooner or later before the world becomes a big mess.	11
3880	3189	Books have been apart of every single person's life as soon as they learn to read	0
3881	3189	First our parents read us books to get us to go to sleep	1
3882	3189	Then our teachers read us books to teach us things or to keep us preoccupied	2
3883	3189	Then, when we get a little older, we are assigned to read books for classes	3
3884	3189	There is even reading in the workplace, whether it be reciepts or orders or recipes	4
3885	3189	Readings is something that we cannot get away from	5
3886	3189	This leads me to say that authors write books for an audience and write the book as best they can to atrract the attention of the audience	6
3887	3189	I do not believe that books, regardless if one person deems them offensive, should be removed from the shelf that they have been placed on	7
3888	3189	I think that there are things we can do if we do not want to read that particular book	8
3889	3189	There are also things parents can do to ensure that the books their children are reading are appropriate and not offensive	9
3890	3189	Also there are advantages to reading books that @MONTH1 show something different that that person @MONTH1 have experienced before	10
3891	3189	First, I feel that books should not be removed from libraries because some people think that they are offensive	11
3892	3189	Everyone has an opinion and just because one person does not like the book, should not mean that the experience of reading that book should be taken away from someone else	12
3893	3189	If you find a book to be offensive, you can simply stop reading the book	13
3894	3189	Just because you do not enjoy it does not mean someone else will not also	14
3895	3189	That is just apart of humans having their own opinions	15
3896	3189	On a different note, I think that childrens' books are a little bit different	16
3897	3189	Parents have the right and responsibility to protect their children	17
3898	3189	I believe that parents should take a proactive role in monitoring their children	18
3899	3189	For young children, I think that parents should just read the book first and judge whether or not they think they're child should read it	19
3900	3189	Then for young adults, I think that parents could try to look up somethings about the book	20
3901	3189	The internet is a great source for reviews and ratings of books	21
3902	3189	Therefore, I believe that censorship for childrens' books is a responsibilty of the parent	22
3903	3189	Lastly, I think books that are different to everyone and can be interpreted differently	23
3904	3189	When I read a book, think about the scheme, imagine the characters, and react to the events, I come up with my own opinion of the book	24
3905	3189	My friend, who is also reading the same book, could form a completely different opinon of the book	25
3906	3189	But we both gained something by reading the book	26
3907	3189	In conclusion, I think that books should be censored by parents and that is it	27
3908	3189	I think that reading books is a very positive thing	28
3909	3189	So no one should have the right to tell people what they should and should not read	29
3910	3189	Also, books are things that can be discussed and everyone can make their own opinions about	30
3911	3189	It is my opinion that every book should have its own place on a shelf.	31
3912	3190	I believe that they should not be pulled off of the shelf if they are found to be offensive	0
3913	3190	Many people have there own taste in what they like to read, write and do	1
3914	3190	Therefore, there should be a wide variety of these things on the shelfs so people can do what they enjoy best	2
3915	3190	Books and magazines @MONTH1 be offensive, but they @MONTH1 also entice the reader	3
3916	3190	i personally love books about drugs, sex, and many other inappropriate things	4
3917	3190	In fact my favorite book is banned from my school library	5
3918	3190	If they took all inappropriate books out of they library	6
3919	3190	What would i read	7
3920	3190	not everything can be just peachy kin all the time	8
3921	3190	Its not in real life, so why should we have to read a little fantasy world that we know isnt true	9
3922	3190	I know i would'nt want to read that	10
3923	3190	Just like books and magazines, every one has their own taste in music	11
3924	3190	some like country, classical, metal, and maybe even rock	12
3925	3190	If you took the songs that were offensive off the shelf that would make people angry	13
3926	3190	That's like not playing a song on the radio thats offensive, and many songs played on the radio are degradeing to women	14
3927	3190	if it can be played on the radio	15
3928	3190	Why cant it be in a library	16
3929	3190	there going to be able to listen to that song on the radio anyway	17
3930	3190	Most movies these days are very gory or offensive in many aspects	18
3931	3190	Many people are interested in these movies	19
3932	3190	If you can watch that movie in a movie theatre, why cant you check it out of a library	20
3933	3190	Some people go to check out movies that are shown in school so they can watch it if they were absent	21
3934	3190	What would they do if that movie got taken off the shelf	22
3935	3190	Fail	23
3936	3190	I know i would become angry if that would happen to me	24
3937	3190	Keep offensive books, music, movies, and magazines on the library shelfs	25
3938	3190	People will eventually see them, hear them, and watch them even if its not in the library	26
3939	3190	Even if you take out offensive materials there still going to get them sooner or later no matter what you do	27
3940	3191	When have you ever went into a library and found a book that is so offensive that you complain or try to get that certain book off the shelf	0
3941	3191	Have you ever read a book half way through and questioned why you are reading it	1
3942	3191	Why would you read a book that you know you're not going to like	2
3943	3191	If someone has the right and the authority to take books off the shelf that bothers them, then I have the exact same right as them	3
3944	3191	I thought everyone was treated by equal rights	4
3945	3191	When i ever do read I always read the back of the book or whats called the summary of the story so I can see if I'm going to like it or not	5
3946	3191	If I know a book is going to offend me or a magazine or even a movie, most likely I'm not going to even bother giving my attention to them	6
3947	3191	Obviously the author doesnt like censorship or she wouldnt be arguing about it	7
3948	3191	It's obviously something that bothers her and everyone is intitiled to their own beliefs and disbeliefs	8
3949	3191	I respect people that stand up for themselves and find the hardest ways out of hard prediciments	9
3950	3191	I can say I always go to libraries and read books because I'm not a reader	10
3951	3191	But i can tell you if I ever did go to a library and i found a book on the shelf that offends me its probably going to offend someone else	11
3952	3191	So why would they even try to bother getting away with being offensive to people	12
3953	3191	Everyone is intitled to their own opinion	13
3954	3191	But i think if it's going to offend someone in praticular it's probably going to bother someone else	14
3955	3191	I'm not saying everyone is alike but most people believe in things that other people believe in	15
3956	3191	People can hav the same agreements and disagreements	16
3957	3191	I do have to agree with @PERSON1 because she is right	17
3958	3191	You would be amazed on the amount and different things people can get offended by	18
3959	3191	I have tons of experiences of movies, books, music, and magazines that have offended me	19
3960	3191	But I didnt let it pull me down or anything	20
3961	3191	For example I stopped watching the movie, and I stopped reading the book that bothered me	21
3962	3191	You can't wear your emotions on your shoulders but you can stand up for your rights and tell people what you believe	22
3963	3191	@CAPS1't ever tell anyone that you can't believe in your opinions	23
3964	3191	If certain things offend you, @CAPS1't let them bother you just stop doing what your doing and move on to something else	24
3965	3191	Like I said I have had alot of experiences of offensive things I have read and watched	25
3966	3191	Like awhile back I watched a movie that had a black man in it and he was locked in prison and killed in prison for being accused of something he didn't do	26
3967	3191	It was just because the time era and it was also because he was black	27
3968	3191	Thats the kind of stuff that really upsets me	28
3969	3191	Because we are all the same	29
3970	3191	We @MONTH1 look different and see things different	30
3971	3191	But our bodies function the same and we all breathe the same air	31
3972	3191	I have always gone by the saying, '@CAPS1't ever judge a book by it's cover until you read it.'     So whatever people @MONTH1 think I believe in one thing and it's to let people believe in things they want to believe in	32
3973	3191	@CAPS1't ever tell someone how to think, act, or feel	33
3974	3191	I agree with Katherine Paterson.	34
3975	3192	When I go to a library I @MONTH1 find some stuff that is offensive to me	0
3976	3192	But if somthing is offensive to me the person beside me @MONTH1 not  think the same thing  is offensive to him or her	1
3977	3192	When people try to put boundaries on what is offensive and what is not they can not 	2
3978	3192	There is a wide variety of people that all have diffrent opinions based on their history	3
3979	3192	What I think is offensive @MONTH1 be seen as the best thing that has ever been printed, published, or recorded and other people's eyes	4
3980	3192	The major problem is that offensive doesn't have a set definition	5
3981	3192	I don't think that you will ever find a definition that everyone can agree on	6
3982	3192	There needs to be a limitations to keep certain things away from certain age groups	7
3983	3192	For example you would not want a kindergarder to be able to check out a @CAPS1 movie	8
3984	3192	Some censoring has to be done to protect people.But it all comes down to common sense	9
3985	3192	We won't ever all agree on what is offensive but if we use are common sense the problem @MONTH1 be solved	10
3986	3193	Certain people beleive that offensive books, magazines, or music should be taken off of the shelves of libraries	0
3987	3193	I think that offensive books and music and media should not be taken off of the shelves	1
3988	3193	It is a persons own right to see certain things that are offensive if they choose to do so	2
3989	3193	It is also not another persons right to decide what other people can and cannot observe	3
3990	3193	If certain offensive things were taken off of the shelves of libraries such as music, books etc	4
3991	3193	the knowledge of people would be limited to only what the library or the government would want them to know and that is not right	5
3992	3193	It is someones personal decision wether or not they look at listen to or read offensive things	6
3993	3193	People shouldn't be sheltered by society and only know what is wanted for them to know	7
3994	3193	If libraries eliminated offensive media then people would be able to form their own oppinions and ideas	8
3995	3193	In some cases reading and knowing certain things that are offensive to some people should be known to the world	9
3996	3193	One case is how people should know about the holocaust in the @DATE1	10
3997	3193	Im shure reading about the holocaust is very affensive to copius amounts of people, but even though this history is disturbing and offensive people should know about it so that history does not repeat itself	11
3998	3193	The government and society does not have the right to decide what people take in	12
3999	3193	For example what if all of a certain type of music was eliminated from libraries, the internet, and tv	13
4000	3193	it would slowly dissolve out of  existence	14
4001	3193	Certain things like reading about the times before racial equality, and such things as slavery are very offensive for people to read about	15
4002	3193	But these things must be read and heard and passed down through history so it isn't forgotten	16
4003	3193	The knowledge of offensive things should not be taken away from people by the libraries	17
4004	3193	Yes offensive things shouldnt be celebrated or looked upon as good but people should know	18
4005	3193	People in the world cant just know the good things or only what their society wants them to know, they also have to know about the bad things and offensive things that happen and have happened as well.	19
4006	3194	Katherine Paterson said ' If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	0
4007	3194	' In this quote I think she was trying to get across that if someone picks up a book or a magazine and reads it and then puts it back and maybe its not the best book ever to them and they @MONTH1 find it offensive, but someone else comes along and wants to read it and they @MONTH1 not find it offensive, then you have two different view points on a book that @MONTH1 be offensive to one person, but to another it @MONTH1 not be	1
4008	3194	Different view points really effect how to censor books, because of how people are so different, there difference on how they feel about a book could effect what should happen to that book	2
4009	3194	I dont believe that books, movies, music, magazines, and other materials such as those should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to someone	3
4010	3194	If they are found offensive to a bunch of different people then yes they should be removed, but if its only bothering one or two people but there are other people that agree that its not offensive, then dont get rid of it just because of a couple people	4
4011	3194	Take a vote maybe to see how many people agree and dissagree on keeping or getting rid of it then decide whether or not you should keep or get rid of it off of that vote	5
4012	3194	I think it would be more fair and satisfactory to take a vote on whether or not it is fair to keep or remove it	6
4013	3194	If someone has a memory about something they read or remember an experience from it and then someone else reads it and feels offened by something its not fair to the other person to get rid of it	7
4014	3194	Its especially not fair to the person with the memories and experiences	8
4015	3194	So dont  remove books just because a couple people might find it offensive, take a vote to decide	9
4016	3194	Let more than just a few people deciede on behalf of the book	10
4017	3194	More than just a few people can make an impact on just one book, and you never know what differnt views you @MONTH1 find from different people on just one book	11
4018	3194	People need to be able to discuss their veiws on the book and then bedate on whether or not to keep it, so dont choose to get rid of them without several view points on the book.	12
4019	3195	Library Censorship     Everyone has their favorite book	0
4020	3195	But if it offended someone, should he be allowed to remove it	1
4021	3195	Offensive materials should not be removed from shelves	2
4022	3195	If we removed books that offended even one person, then no books would remain	3
4023	3195	As americans, we have the right to freedom of speech	4
4024	3195	Authors use their freedom in their writing, just like musicians use their freedom to make music	5
4025	3195	But if we denied them their right to put out their creations, we would be denying them their basic rights as an american citizen	6
4026	3195	Personally, I hate rap	7
4027	3195	I don't even consider it to be music, due to the fact that no one actually sings	8
4028	3195	But I do understand that a large percent of our population does enjoy listening to it	9
4029	3195	Should I be allowed to remove it from shelves, leaving teenagers without their music, denying artists' freedom of speech, and ultimately, leaving them unemployed	10
4030	3195	One of my favorite series is the @PERSON2 series, by @PERSON1	11
4031	3195	It is about a young teenager who learns to deal with all the struggles of growning up by depending on @CAPS1, and it helped me do the same	12
4032	3195	But because it is a @CAPS2 series, should it be removed from shelves	13
4033	3195	Should other young girls be denied the chance to read this life-changing series, simply because someone might find it offensive	14
4034	3195	Although some wish they could elimate certain materials that they find offensive, it isn't fair to the authors, musicians, or fans of those pieces of work	15
4035	3195	However, those who find it offensive should be allowed to avoid it	16
4036	3195	Libraries need to make sure they separate each topic distinctly, so people can easily tell where they should or shouldn't avoid	17
4037	3195	Libraries are suppost to be a resource for everyone, which means they need to have materials for everyone, even though they might seem offensive.	18
4038	3196	Cencorship in books is one of the main concerns in @LOCATION1	0
4039	3196	If it was up to me to remove a book from a shelf, I would not do it, to my personal opinion, I think that we as @CAPS1's should just read over the probloms and quit complaining about it	1
4040	3196	Yes, we do have some books that people seem to not like, such as 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', but the only reason that it has been pulled off the shelfs of librarys and schools is because it uses the word 'nigger', and I find it to be kind of idiodic, that people would over react to that word when themselves were not even around to know the real meaning of	2
4041	3196	Cencorship in music	3
4042	3196	This is another big concern for people in @LOCATION1	4
4043	3196	The lyrics used in most songs I find to be 'disturbing' or are trying to get people and young kids to comite acts of crime and other illigal acts	5
4044	3196	Music such as rap and the lyrics used in rap are whats making kids do stupid stuff, the music talks about sex, drug usage, and murder	6
4045	3196	I don't think that I would go as far as to pull it off the shelf, but I would make the sellers put them in a 'can only perchas if @NUM1' section	7
4046	3196	Most of the crime we have today people blame on music	8
4047	3196	To my observation about these subjects are that I have seen people read a book that uses profound language in it and be ok with it, they don't over react to it so therfor it shouldn't be removed from shelfs	9
4048	3196	To my observation about the rap music, sure, in a way it should be pulled off the shelfs and never be sold again, but, I have seen people who listen to it and never smoke, never kill, and never harms another person	10
4049	3196	To my own experience I listen to some of these gore obbsessed bands and read profound languaged books and got over it, these thing should be overlooked and forgotten	11
4050	3196	This is just a common scence thing but, there are a lot of things that should be pulled off shelfs, I would, and it has to do with movies and magazines	12
4051	3196	Some movies have always been a problom to society, I have witnessed this that some movies show just a little bit to much nudeity in it, which I seem to think is not a good thing that our younger children should see, whether it's at the theater or on t.v	13
4052	3196	this things should be pulled	14
4053	3196	My observation about magazines it that I have personal her one of my best friends say that 'I want to look as skinny and this girl does on this magazine because I'm to fat'	15
4054	3196	There are a lot of magaziens that should not be showed or read because it does say that skinny is better and so many girls and women are starving themselves to look like the person on the cover of a magazien, and it's rediculous to see that happen, If it was my choise, I would ban these matirals from useage or sight, mainly because this is all just one big peer presure conspericy	16
4055	3196	I would not ban all of the things that I have put in this paper, just the things that I that personal find disturbing or not fot the publics eye's.	17
4056	3197	I don't think censorship is right for our public libraries	0
4057	3197	In my opinion, it depends on what they are saying or what they are showing	1
4058	3197	Also, it depends on what what the ages the kids are or adults	2
4059	3197	People are different in many ways	3
4060	3197	It also depends on the way they take it in their signifaction	4
4061	3197	If they move books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves because their offensive that wouldn't be a very good idea because how would other people get ahold of it and want to read it in life, if they get taken off the shelves	5
4062	3197	Some people enjoy actually reading that stuff and nothing else	6
4063	3197	I just don't think that people would be to happy	7
4064	3197	Also, they're different cultures in these countries that read stuff like that	8
4065	3197	People would like to learn about different things	9
4066	3197	If people took the books and other things like that off the shelves, there would be hardly anything to read	10
4067	3197	Childrens and up to adult books has all different kinds of things	11
4068	3197	The books and things like that you can read can have more things in it besides offensive things, sometimes they can have more information in those books than others	12
4069	3197	In my conclusion, censorship is not good in our public libraries because it taking basic things out of the libraries and taking half of the reading from people.	13
4070	3199	Do we have the right to take books	0
4071	3199	Author Katherine Paterson proves a point by saying 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
4072	3199	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if everyone is able to just remove books from the shelf because they have something agaist it then we would hardly have any books at our libraries	2
4073	3199	Everyone has their own opinions	3
4074	3199	There are so many things that effect our opinions	4
4075	3199	Our beliefs, life styles, way of thinking, culture, and the list goes on	5
4076	3199	I'm sure I could think of certain books, movies, music, and magazines that I dont like and could just do without	6
4077	3199	Does that mean I want to totally rid the world of those certain materials	7
4078	3199	It sure wouldnt bother me but that would be extreamly selfish	8
4079	3199	Even if something is totally innopropriate and offensive it is still information	9
4080	3199	Maybe it shouldnt go in the little kids section of a library or store but i dont think it should be removed completely	10
4081	3199	Music especially	11
4082	3199	There are wide ranges of music from rap, rock, oldies, screamo, classical, country, alternative and the list goes on	12
4083	3199	I dispise country	13
4084	3199	I go for the alternative and classical music	14
4085	3199	I know a lot of people who love it though	15
4086	3199	All the old people i know hate all the rap	16
4087	3199	Most of it is pretty offensive but thats just how things are	17
4088	3199	So no, I dont think anyone should have the right to remove anything from anywhere just because they personally find it offensive	18
4089	3199	We cant hide from the world	19
4090	3199	I think people should be open to new things and understand that not everyone likes the same things	20
4091	3199	If we remove thing materials we dont care for, others will remove the ones you like and so on	21
4092	3199	So then were left with nothing	22
4093	3199	Just like freedom of speech we should have the freedom to read, listen to, and watch what we enjoy	23
4094	3200	I believe that censorship should be allowed when it comes to certain things but I don't believe censorship belongs in public libraries	0
4095	3200	Books are wrote to stimulate the imagination of a persons mind and if they cannot read books that are the slightest offensive, then they will never know what it is like to open some of the greatest books ever wrote until that person has grown up	1
4096	3200	And there are several studies that show that books stimulate the human mind and taking away these books would be a crushing blow to those statistics	2
4097	3200	For example, a student has been assigned a report on a piece of classical literature	3
4098	3200	So he/she goes to the public library to find a good book, but when that student gets the he/she finds out that all pieces of classical literature have been removed from the library due to being overly offensive	4
4099	3200	What would that person do	5
4100	3200	Should he/she just give up because every single piece of classical literature has been taken out of every library in the country, I say no	6
4101	3200	This is a problem because almost every great book ever wrote has at least a few parts where it is slightly offensive to that certain reader	7
4102	3200	From personal experience I can back this statement up with books I have read going through my school career	8
4103	3200	For example, when I was in the @NUM1 grade  was assigned a book report over @PERSON1, so I went to our library in the school to look for this book and it was nowhere to be found	9
4104	3200	I asked the librarian where this book was and she said that it had been removed due to being offensive to the black population for having the word negro inprinted on its pages	10
4105	3200	So I asked her if I could go tot the public library to get the book and she said that it had been removed from its shelves as well	11
4106	3200	I did not know what to do, I was completely clueless and I had no book to write my report over	12
4107	3200	So eventually the teacher had to change the report topic because not on student was able to find @PERSON1	13
4108	3200	But if the state had not allowed these books to be taken off of the shelves then we would not have had this problem	14
4109	3200	Another example was when my friend @PERSON2 wanted to learn about his culture and where his ancestors came from	15
4110	3200	But when he got to the library he could not find any books over the arabic world	16
4111	3200	So he asked the librarian 'where are all the books covering @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION1?'  And the librarian said that they were all removed because after @NUM2 @CAPS1 saw arabs as very offensive people and that no books were left unchecked	17
4112	3200	I'm sure that he found this comment to be very offensive but there was nothing that he could do about it because the white people found arabs to be offensive and unequal to the white race	18
4113	3200	These are only a few things that have already happened becaue of people finding certain books to be offensive, which is why I believe that the government should leave all the books on the shelves and let the people decide to pick up that book or pass it by	19
4114	3200	Sure people have a freedom of speech but it should not effect what books belong on the shelf	20
4115	3200	Which is why I believe that censorship should not be allowed to effect libraries of the public.	21
4116	3201	Censorship in Libraries     @CAPS1 are alot of things on the library shelves that you @MONTH1 be concerned about	0
4117	3201	You @MONTH1 be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves	1
4118	3201	On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines	2
4119	3201	Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising	3
4120	3201	Some things I have expierenced is with the launguage it contains	4
4121	3201	I have seen some books, magazines, music, and movies have are cusswords	5
4122	3201	Also some @MONTH1 have racism things in it that you don't like	6
4123	3201	Another thing is that @CAPS1 is some bad persuading such as bad things that you hear or see and you wonder what it would be like to do that stuff	7
4124	3201	Also another thing are advertisements	8
4125	3201	Some things a magazine can contain are about advertising tobacco, such as its good for you to try	9
4126	3201	Other ads are alcohol ads like a picture of someone with a beer or whiskey in @CAPS1 hand, and we think its cool to try it, but its not	10
4127	3201	The last thing that is really bad in advertisement is drug advertisement, such as a picture of a drug leaf, or inscents	11
4128	3201	It is bad to do drugs because it can ruin you whole career in high school and maybe in college	12
4129	3201	The last thing are pictures and scenes	13
4130	3201	In movies, @CAPS1 could be scenes that you don't approve of	14
4131	3201	In some magazines @CAPS1 can be pictures in which you don't approve in either	15
4132	3201	So things that I have seen are pictures and scenes in movies and magazines that have innapropiate scenes, and innapropiate pictures	16
4133	3201	Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising @CAPS1 is	17
4134	3201	On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines	18
4135	3201	You @MONTH1 be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves	19
4136	3201	@CAPS1 are alot of things on the library shelves that you @MONTH1 be concerned about.	20
4137	3202	Books that are found offensive should not be taken off of library shelves	0
4138	3202	Books tell stories fiction or non-fiction	1
4139	3202	Many books that @MONTH1 be found offensive are historical	2
4140	3202	These books could include topics such as wars, eras, people, ect	3
4141	3202	Everyone has the same rights to read any book they want	4
4142	3202	They also have the right to not read the book at all	5
4143	3202	Books that are taken off the shelves of a library because of one person, or a group of people, being offended henders the ability of someone who wants to read the book, to read the book	6
4144	3202	We, as people, should not be able to take this right away from other people	7
4145	3202	They should be able to read anything they want	8
4146	3202	If someone wants to read a biography or history about @CAPS1, they should be able to	9
4147	3202	The topic of @CAPS1 and the @ORGANIZATION1 @MONTH1 be found to be offensive because of what they stand for	10
4148	3202	If we look at the topic as purely a historical reference not as a story to be read for enjoyment there will never be any offence in these books	11
4149	3202	These stories have a large role in history	12
4150	3202	If we do not learn from their mistakes, history @MONTH1 repeat itself	13
4151	3202	History is around to be studied, even if the topics might be offensive to some people	14
4152	3202	Political correctness can not always be followed when writing a story	15
4153	3202	Such as in To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4	16
4154	3202	This book has many issues when it comes to political correctness	17
4155	3202	These issues include	18
4156	3202	the killing of an innicent man and revealing the flaws in our judicial system, the use of the word 'nigger' to describe the black characters, and the racial unequality of the @LOCATION1 duringthe @DATE1's	19
4157	3202	These issues would deffinately be offensive to some readers, but this book is an award winner and uses history as a guide	20
4158	3202	The situations in this novel are ones that could be real	21
4159	3202	They are things we must learn about, so we do not repeat them	22
4160	3202	Another story that fits quite well into this topic is @CAPS5 @NUM1	23
4161	3202	This novel is about a world where all books are burnt	24
4162	3202	No books are allowed to be read by the people	25
4163	3202	This book reveals the removal of offensive books to its exteme	26
4164	3202	No matter who you are or what you believe, there will be some topics that you find offensive	27
4165	3202	If we remove every book that someone finds offensive we will have no books on the shelves of any library	28
4166	3202	A library is not a library wihout its books	29
4167	3202	If we allow books to begin to be removed from the shelves, we will not be able to stop it	30
4168	3202	One day we will end up like the world in @CAPS5 @NUM1	31
4169	3202	No history will be know but what is passed down	32
4170	3202	No more stories will be here to entertain us, but the ones memorized	33
4171	3202	No books will exzist and this world would be terrible without books	34
4172	3202	Books that are found to be offensive should not be taken off of library shelves	35
4173	3202	The taking away of these books takes away the freedom to read anything you want	36
4174	3202	It reduces the chances we have to learn and to flourish	37
4175	3202	Political correctness should not take the place of our own freedom, and as long as we keep our books on their shelves, it won't	38
4176	3203	I believe that libraries should have more cencorship	0
4177	3203	Some books, magazines, and movies should be removed or grouped by age	1
4178	3203	From my own experiences of reading or seeing people read these books, I believe they should be removed because they influence violence, sexual activity, and drug use	2
4179	3203	Young children should not be exposed to those things yet	3
4180	3203	First, I think books that contain violence should be removed	4
4181	3203	I believe that children are the easiest people to influence	5
4182	3203	I also believe that violence is the worst thing to be influenced by	6
4183	3203	Violence in books can influence killing	7
4184	3203	Fighting and killing is not good	8
4185	3203	No young child should be able to check out about full of shooting and fighting	9
4186	3203	The book will make the kids think thats the right thing to do if they are able to check it out	10
4187	3203	Being influenced by violence will make you commit crimes	11
4188	3203	Reading a book is not worth going to jail for	12
4189	3203	Next, I believe that all sexual activity material should be removed from libraries	13
4190	3203	Sexual activity should not be exposed to children until it is time for them to start learning about it	14
4191	3203	For example, a young girl reading about teen pregnacy not being a problem	15
4192	3203	The reader will think that is what she is suppsed to do which is wrong	16
4193	3203	Books and magazines containing sexually explicit words should not be able to be viewed by young children	17
4194	3203	Those thing @MONTH1 influence kids to do things they should not even be thinking about doing	18
4195	3203	You can atleast sort them all in an adult section	19
4196	3203	Finally, drug use should not be issued in books to kids	20
4197	3203	children should not read or watch anything that are talking about drugs in a positive way	21
4198	3203	Unless it is about saying no to drugs and not using them, children should not read them at all	22
4199	3203	Drugs make people do things that their right mind don't want them to do	23
4200	3203	Children should say no to drugs and to books that are influencing the opposite	24
4201	3203	In coclusion, that is why I believe that we need censorship in our libraries	25
4202	3203	we need censorship because of viloence and drug use	26
4203	3203	Also becuse of sexual activity and many more things	27
4204	3204	Dear newspaper and staff,               @CAPS1 has came to my attention that @CAPS1 is being considered that most libraries in the community @MONTH1 have a removal and or censorship of some books in the libary	0
4205	3204	I find this not accepable	1
4206	3204	in my opinion this is a attempt to mislead or perhaps hide previous evidence of offenisve reading material from futher generations	2
4207	3204	For example, a personal favorite of mine is a book labled ' A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS1', this book describes a childs heartships and the abuse he takes on a daily basics	3
4208	3204	Books of this sort are not only imformitive @CAPS1 also gives the reader an open mind on how things might have been	4
4209	3204	Some topics @MONTH1 include	5
4210	3204	slavery, abuse, war, and discrimation	6
4211	3204	These topics today are still among the things that happen in today's society	7
4212	3204	Censoring and removal of these book are pointless	8
4213	3204	for the simple reason that at least three of the four are a current issue	9
4214	3204	@CAPS1 is strickly important for our generations to be aware of the heartships, problems, and lessons in which these topics araised	10
4215	3204	Without imforming our generations of these issues @CAPS1 could result in a repeat of history, which we as a country are trying to prevent	11
4216	3204	My opinion on movies however are a little different	12
4217	3204	I believe some movies are okay	13
4218	3204	but they must not contain obvious and purpose acts of discrimnation and or offesive material	14
4219	3204	Most movies nowadays if they are offesive in a relating way to the movie then they are rated at least @CAPS5 @NUM1 or rated @CAPS5 @NUM2 this allows certain age groups able to watch material that @MONTH1 be offesive or perhaps discrimating	15
4220	3204	They @MONTH1 also need adult combinations to preview the movie	16
4221	3204	So in my closing i would like for you to consider my opinion as a wise outlook on offensive/ discrimating issues	17
4222	3204	I just fully believe open @ORGANIZATION1 content is allowed at certain ages, depending on the content	18
4223	3204	Plently observations must be made by parents/ guradians if needed	19
4224	3204	I appreatiate your time and understanding of my letter	20
4225	3204	Thanks	21
4226	3204	Sincerly,                                                                                     @PERSON1- @ORGANIZATION1	22
4227	3205	Everyone today gets offeneded daily	0
4228	3205	So to go to a library and see offensive material on the shelfs is no different than the rest of the day	1
4229	3205	However, there are those minds, which have not been poluted and influenced by these offensive materials, that should have a right to keep thier minds that way	2
4230	3205	One solution to the problem could be that we start rating books and magazines like we do for movies	3
4231	3205	The material rated for adults gets put in one area of the lirary while the lower rated material is put on display for the public	4
4232	3205	The higher rated can be put in an area that is not seen everyday by the public, and is kept secret thus protecting the uninfluenced minds and the people wanting said material can still have their way	5
4233	3205	Another solution might be to just get rid of the censored material	6
4234	3205	It, in my opinion and experience, corrupts both the mind and soul, and causes man to be things he is not by nature	7
4235	3205	Men, who have nothing better to do than to sit and read or look at things ment for inside of marrage, often accoplish nothing of great value in their life time	8
4236	3205	They are thus a hinderence to soceity	9
4237	3205	But if they can not accsess the material, they then need something to do to fill that time	10
4238	3205	In which case they can find a good classic to read or maybe pick up that dusty @CAPS1 off the shelf	11
4239	3205	This thus leaves the labraries with a choice	12
4240	3205	They can leave their library the way that they want, they can put the offensive material in a seclueded room, or they can remove definent offensive material and keep soceity on its feet accomplishing great feats for the next generation to odserve	13
4241	3205	Thus the amount of offending someone goes down and maybe the library attendence goes up.	14
4242	3206	Have you ever found or seen books, music, movies, or magazines in a library that are offensive to you	0
4243	3206	If so, then would you have wanted to remove it off of the shelf so none of your children or anyone else that might have found it offensive, to see it	1
4244	3206	Well, I have actually gone to the library and seen some things that was offensive to me, and I have also heard my family members talking about it	2
4245	3206	So I am going to talk about what I have heard about my family seeing or finding books, music, movies, and magazines offensive	3
4246	3206	Also, I am going to explain how I felt and what i wanted to do when i seen those things in a library that was offensive to me	4
4247	3206	The last thing that I am going to talk about is how I feel on censorship in libraries	5
4248	3206	First, I have been hearing from my sisters, my mother, and my step-mother about how they find some books, music, movies, and magazines at a library that was offensive to them	6
4249	3206	Now I do not know exactly what the books, magazines, etc., was that they found offensive but I do know what they thought about them and what they wanted to do	7
4250	3206	So one day, my sisters, mother, and step-mother was talking about a couple of books that she found offensive	8
4251	3206	They never said what the books were but they kept talking about how they felt and what they would have liked to do with them	9
4252	3206	Now she told my family and I that she was badly offended by what they were called and what they were about	10
4253	3206	Also she was saying that she would have really liked to have taken the books, music, movies, etc., off of the shelves, so other people that might have found them offensive would not see them	11
4254	3206	But, they all did also agree on the fact that they really do not have the right to remove them from the shelves	12
4255	3206	Their reason why they do not have that right is because of there are a lot of people who they do not know if they find it offensive or not	13
4256	3206	The people who do not find it offensive might actually want to read them	14
4257	3206	So, they just agreed to look past them and ignore what is there if it offends them for the people who do not find them offensive	15
4258	3206	Now, from my point of view from finding or seeing books, music, movies, magazines, etc., in a library that are or was offensive to me	16
4259	3206	There have been a couple of times where I have walked in a library where I found a couple of books that was offensive towards me	17
4260	3206	I really did not like what the books were all about and called, and I really would have liked to take them off the shelves and throw them away so no other person who might have found them offensive would find them or see them	18
4261	3206	So what if there are other people who would have actually wanted to read those books	19
4262	3206	That was what I thought about when I was tempted to actually remove them	20
4263	3206	So I decided not to remove the books from the shelves, so the people who did not find them offensive could read them, if they wanted to	21
4264	3206	I respected the fact that there are other people that are out there that would want to read those books but at the same time, I knew that there are people who could find them offensive but I just thought that they would just ignore the fact that they are there	22
4265	3206	So, on to the last thing that I am going to talk about	23
4266	3206	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves, at a library, if they are found offensive	24
4267	3206	Also my views on censorship in libraries	25
4268	3206	Well I do believe that they should be removed so they wpuld not be offending anyone that walked into that library	26
4269	3206	But, if people had the right to remove books or anything that is offensive towards them, then there would literally be no books left in the libraries	27
4270	3206	Then there would not be any point in having libraries or in anyone writing books	28
4271	3206	So then again, I do not believe that any person should have a right to just remove the books that are offensive to them at all	29
4272	3206	I belive that if they find a book that is offensive to them, then they should just ignore that it is there and respect that there are a lot of people out there who would want to or like to read those books	30
4273	3206	So I do not believe that there should be any censorship in libraries at all	31
4274	3206	It is not anyones fault that people find books, music, movies, magazines, etc., offensive to them	32
4275	3206	So no, there should absolutely not be any censorship in a library	33
4276	3206	So there, I have just explained my views on censroship in libraries and if I believe that people should have the right to remove books from a shelf just cause they found it offensive	34
4277	3206	Like I have stated before, there should not be any censorship in libraries at all	35
4278	3206	But yes, I do understand that people find things that are offensive, but they should just ignore that they are there and respect that there are people who want to or would like to read those books	36
4279	3206	Once again, do you believe that people should have the right to remove a book from a shelf just cause they found it offensive, and what are your views on censorship in libraries?	37
4280	3207	Should certain books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive	0
4281	3207	Books, movies, magazines, music are made to relay a message, express a point of veiw, or to perhaps state an oppionion, of which everyone has a different point of veiw	1
4282	3207	No, books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should not be simply taken off of the shelves or out of stores	2
4283	3207	All of the previously listed things are rated	3
4284	3207	Movies are rated @CAPS1 through @CAPS2, books are rated child through adult, and music if explicit has a parental advisery sticker, so just follow the ratings	4
4285	3207	IF a four-year old tried to buy two tickets to see a rated @CAPS2 movie the theater would not sell him the tickets because he is not yet off age	5
4286	3207	People @MONTH1 bring the point of maybe a child picks up a adult book or magazine in a store and begins to look at it and read it	6
4287	3207	The solution to that problem is simple create a seperate room in stores that sell these items and label the room adult section	7
4288	3207	Have cameras near by so if a yongster feels brave enough to tempt fate they will be caught or just put a desk out front of the adult section and require an i.d	8
4289	3207	for entrance	9
4290	3207	These are still books which are expressions of a persons dreams, hope, desires, fantasies, and heart, they should not be denied there dream because a person deems it unfit	10
4291	3207	And most apparent if it offends you dont read it	11
4292	3207	Simply follow the rating rules	12
4293	3207	Take necesary precations	13
4294	3207	If all of these rules are followed then buisnesses and libraries should have no probles keeping everybody safe and happy.	14
4295	3208	If I could remove anything from shelves of libraries I wouldn't	0
4296	3208	Would you rather your kids to learn things from the facts or learn from friends	1
4297	3208	Censoring books, magazines, movies, etc and what goes onto the shelves are mostly for enjoyment or informational	2
4298	3208	Granted you wouldn't want a five-year old reading a book made for adults, but with age kids would have to learn things	3
4299	3208	You can't always control what children read unless you plan on going with them everywhere including college and on into their adult life	4
4300	3208	Books provide facts and more reliable information than what  you can hear from people	5
4301	3208	If all the books on the shelves relating to drugs or alcohol were pulled off, how would someone write a report on those things	6
4302	3208	The books were created to provide people, kids especially, with facts that no one else could share and it could help with expanding their vocabulary and knowledge	7
4303	3208	If someone were to find a book or a @CAPS1 offensive, they don't have to look at it or even pick it up	8
4304	3208	Libraries can't always suit everyone's tastes and something you @MONTH1 find offensive isn't to others	9
4305	3208	Takign a single book from the shelves would result in others taking books off the shelves and then no books would be left for anyone to read or wish to take off the shelves	10
4306	3208	If you controlled what everyone read, no one would be happy and their brain wouldn't function correctly	11
4307	3208	You'd be taking one of their rights, one of the only things entitled to them without someone else telling them they can't	12
4308	3208	What kids read is shaping their minds for their future	13
4309	3208	If you removed their favorite series or genre from the shelves, they wouldn't read or listen to music or anything anymore because it isn't enjoyable	14
4310	3208	Kids get into reading when they can enjoy what they read or listen to	15
4311	3208	So with that, I wouldn't take anything off the shelves because everything appeals to someone in one way or another	16
4312	3208	Controlling what one person reads doesn't lead you nor the other person anywhere, someone could end up being offended if you take something you find offensive off the shelves, and you can't stop the knowledge that books can provide people if they read them	17
4313	3208	In one way or another something provides information for people.	18
4314	3210	You gotta admit, although you would like your kids to have freedom, @CAPS3 all of them are responsible enough to handle @CAPS1	0
4315	3210	You could blabber in their ear all day about '@CAPS1's responsible to do this and @CAPS3 do this.' and they will go out and do @CAPS1 anyways	1
4316	3210	Trust me, I'm a teenager	2
4317	3210	I know	3
4318	3210	So there are certin things that you have to take away from them in order to keep them from getting distracted on what @CAPS2 matters in their teenage years	4
4319	3210	And that is schoolwork	5
4320	3210	If school systems allowed there to be offensive or innapropriate materials on their shelves, I just know kids would find themselves to be...well..	6
4321	3210	'distracted'	7
4322	3210	And when I say innapropriate, I don't only mean on sexual terms, I mean for school	8
4323	3210	You would like to think that they would possibly save @CAPS1 for when they checked out and went home and did their work first but, like I stated before, kids are going to do what they want	9
4324	3210	And what they want to do is @PERCENT1 of the time @CAPS3 schoolwork	10
4325	3210	They would rather just sit down, crack open a magazine, and let their eyes glaze over at the sights of celebrities and new scandals	11
4326	3210	School work is a very important thing in teenagers lives, and I feel that when they are in school they should stay focused on schoolwork and activities	12
4327	3210	If they wanted to have free time to go and read magazines, they should do @CAPS1 at home	13
4328	3210	Offensive books should @CAPS3 be there to only distract the teenager from school	14
4329	3210	@CAPS1's unneccesary	15
4330	3210	But with public libraries, @CAPS1's a whole new story	16
4331	3210	I beleive that nothing should be censored from a public library because people go their on their own free will	17
4332	3210	I know I personaly go there for research and for the sheer joy of reading, as do many other people	18
4333	3210	@CAPS1's your choice if you are responsible enough to keep focused on work or get distracted because @CAPS3 only do teenagers go there, but adults do too	19
4334	3210	@CAPS1 is unacceptable for there to be only educational books because who knows what your there for	20
4335	3210	The library is for people to go and read, whether @CAPS1's just for the heck of @CAPS1 or for school	21
4336	3210	@CAPS3 everyone is responsible	22
4337	3210	Especially @CAPS3 teenagers	23
4338	3210	So that's why I personally beleive offensive or innapropriate materials should @CAPS3 be allowed in school libraries, but allwowed in public libraries	24
4339	3210	Although equal rights and freedom in necessary, schoolwork is too important to let kids get distracted from @CAPS1	25
4340	3210	@CAPS1 is the key to their future	26
4341	3211	All people have the same right to read, listion and watch different materials	0
4342	3211	To be censored should be no one choise but your own	1
4343	3211	For some one else to tell you what and what not to read is by my openion very wrong to do	2
4344	3211	If we would censore everything we did we would have a city and nation that would @DATE1 slowly	3
4345	3211	Any givein word can offend any certain person	4
4346	3211	The people that they offend are in my oppioen are the dead weights of our country that are just holding us back from fully ecpressing our self, the colorfull words that we @MONTH1 use can be offensive to one persson yet perfeectly fine to another	5
4347	3211	It all depends on the indivadual that likes or dislikes the word or readings	6
4348	3211	In my observations of people reading and dislikeing it because of it harsh and colorfull words is most offen people that do not fully express them selvs and our yet much more senitive	7
4349	3211	I think this also goes agenst freedom of speech	8
4350	3211	We were gaven that right so why wouldent we use it	9
4351	3211	Why wouldent people want us to express ourselvs	10
4352	3211	I have no idea why any person would want to take books,music,movies and magazines away from us	11
4353	3211	If every thing went by one mans rule of what to and not to read we would down grade as a country and @DATE1	12
4354	3211	Therefore i strongly advise not to take any books off the selves	13
4355	3211	The majordy of the people agree with me to not be censored and only the sensitive people that they offened will just make there own chiose not to pick the book off the selves,not to listen to music, And pick up the magazine	14
4356	3211	the right is ours and thats how is should stay	15
4357	3212	Censorship	0
4358	3212	It's a word that everyone has heard, but do people truly know what it means or how it effects them	1
4359	3212	In the past, books have been censured by rulers and leaders who thought that the material was harmful	2
4360	3212	How could they say that they knew what was best for their people	3
4361	3212	What gave them the right to decide what their people could or could not read	4
4362	3212	In today's society, we still have to deal with censorship issues	5
4363	3212	There are still people who believe that libraries need to censor their books	6
4364	3212	Censorship is wrong	7
4365	3212	Books, magazines, movies, music, etc	8
4366	3212	should not be removed from the shelves just because certain people find them offensive	9
4367	3212	Everyone has different tastes, not only in food, but in every other part of their lives as well	10
4368	3212	No one person has the right to say that one genre is better than another	11
4369	3212	Censorship is wrong because it limits what people can read, watch, and listen to	12
4370	3212	Censorship should not be allowed because it limits what people can read	13
4371	3212	Some people like mysteries, while others like to read romantic books	14
4372	3212	If we allow people to censor what we read, then how can we say that their is a book for everyone to like	15
4373	3212	If libraries censored every book that might offend someone else, then there would not be any books left for anyone to read	16
4374	3212	For example, certain religious books might offend people of other religions, but that does not mean that we should take them off the shelves	17
4375	3212	If we did that, we would have to take away all religious books so that no one was offended	18
4376	3212	Then no one would be able to find books about their religion, and no one would benefit	19
4377	3212	Similarly, censorship limits what people can watch	20
4378	3212	If we removed every movie that had even one tiny part that offended someone else, there would be no more movies left in the world	21
4379	3212	Every movie is going to have something that someone will love and someone will hate	22
4380	3212	If we only focus on the person who hates it and get rid of movies based on the people who hate them, then the people who love the movies will suffer for it	23
4381	3212	People who love horror movies probably hate comedies	24
4382	3212	This does not mean that we need to get rid of comedies just because that there are some people who dislike them	25
4383	3212	It only means that the people who don't like that type of movie don't have to watch them	26
4384	3212	In the exact same way, censorship keeps people from enjoying the type of music that they love	27
4385	3212	We can't censor music because everyone has different types and genres that they like	28
4386	3212	If we take away one kind of music, then we have to take away every kind of music	29
4387	3212	It is not fair to say that we can censor one genre of music because some people dislike it or find it offensive when there are people who truly enjoy listening to that type of music	30
4388	3212	It would be unfair to those people, and if we are unfair to them, we have to be unfair to everybody	31
4389	3212	People would be even more offended than before in that case	32
4390	3212	There will always be unhappy people in the world	33
4391	3212	We should not result to censoring books, movies, and music in libraries and other places just to try make people happy	34
4392	3212	Censorship in libraries limits what people can enjoy	35
4393	3212	It makes the the people who would like the items that have been censored mad	36
4394	3212	We should not result to that	37
4395	3212	We should allow people to pick what they like	38
4396	3212	If a person want to read something they should be allowed	39
4397	3212	If they want to watch a certain movie or listen to a certain song, then why not let them	40
4398	3212	The slim margin of people who dislike what those people enjoy can just avoid reading, watching, or listening to it	41
4399	3212	We can't take something away from the people who love it just because someone is unhappy.	42
4400	3213	I believe that some materials are offensive to some people, but that shouldn't give them a right to want to take it off the shelves	0
4401	3213	No, I do not agree with taking them off the shelves because people could easily over look them and not read them	1
4402	3213	Some people @MONTH1 think they are offensive but they should know that they are not directed twards them	2
4403	3213	Magazines are different because they have peoples faces on the front cover which is uncalled for	3
4404	3213	Some of those people have a family, and doesn't want them to see their face on the front cover of a magazine	4
4405	3213	Katherine Paterson's quote is about wanting to remove books from the shelves so that childern won't be tempted to read them	5
4406	3213	If this is the case I think that its not the right thing to do	6
4407	3213	Some of those books people are taking off the shelves could be the book someone can use to relate to or even learn from	7
4408	3213	Weather or not you want your children to read them or not they could still find them and ask why they have never seen it before and parents wouldn't know what to say	8
4409	3213	Libraries are a resource to people that want to read and learn about new things	9
4410	3213	If you took a book off of a shelf, that could be the book someone really needs	10
4411	3213	Don't be that person to take away from a child's learning	11
4412	3213	You never know who is going to look for what your have taken away	12
4413	3213	And if you take it away they @MONTH1 never find it	13
4414	3213	Some people believe that reading something can be an influence to the way they act, but you cannot blame that on reading	14
4415	3213	That's like saying that your favorite color is lime green because thats @PERSON2's favorite color	15
4416	3213	Its not true and it sure isn't right	16
4417	3213	What would you do if your parents hid a book or something else from you	17
4418	3213	You would be mad at them and wonder why	18
4419	3213	It would make you anxious to read it	19
4420	3213	If they didn't hide it and you found it maybe you wouldn't want to read it because your parents would have let you see it and you wouldn't be interested	20
4421	3213	You have your own choice when it comes to what your children read, watch, and listen to	21
4422	3213	Just don't shut them out of what you read because you were offended	22
4423	3213	Think about it, the music, movie, or book your hiding from them could be the answer to a lot of things	23
4424	3213	It could help them figure out the path they want to take, or maybe the path they don't want to take	24
4425	3213	Either way it would help them be a success in their life	25
4426	3213	So why not take the risk	26
4427	3213	It could even help you.	27
4428	3214	Censorship in the world we live in today is a very interesting concept	0
4429	3214	With the advent of social media, we now have thriving communities of people that want their voice to be heard, and people are listening	1
4430	3214	We now are able to tap into the huge ammount of knowledge from people all around the world, allowing us to see what is really happening in the countries like @LOCATION2, where media is considered treason	2
4431	3214	What do we do now that governments are starting to censor the internet	3
4432	3214	Lets start by looking an arguement that has been long talked about: library censorship	4
4433	3214	Today, it is almost a requirement for cities to have public libraries to be considered as real cities	5
4434	3214	Public libaries, and the funding they require, are not anywhere within the @ORGANIZATION1	6
4435	3214	Even so, they have taken a place in our neighborhoods that has made them indefinate sources of knowledge and culture	7
4436	3214	One public library @MONTH1 be a source of	8
4437	3214	historical town records, children's books, novels, research papers, non-fiction books, fiction books, magazines, and many other types of entertainment and knowledge	9
4438	3214	Public libraries are, even with the widespread usage of the internet, important places for us, as residents of a city, to socialize and learn	10
4439	3214	Libraries today @MONTH1 carry books that were in the past on the 'banned books' list, but that does not mean books are not being banned from libraries	11
4440	3214	Libaries are generally family institutions, and as being funded by the public, required to adhear by the moral and ethical standards of those who live in the area	12
4441	3214	This means that there is not one, 'national banned books list', but there many discrepencies througout @LOCATION1 in banning books	13
4442	3214	As culture moves more and more into more and more questionable materials, libaries are faced with a tough decision	14
4443	3214	keep up with the times and have more questionable and controversial reading material, or get lost in the past and try to kling onto the senior generation to stay alive	15
4444	3214	Bringing new literary materials into the library that is fresh and new means that more people will return to the library again, be it young-adults or older adults trying to get in touch with the current world	16
4445	3214	One major controversy of books in public libaries are the inclusion of sexual intimacy	17
4446	3214	As a new generation sprouts, fed with music lyrics by such names as	18
4447	3214	'@ORGANIZATION2', or '@ORGANIZATION3', we enter a new age where younger and younger kids are learning about sex	19
4448	3214	The authors of today have recognised this and have started to include references to sexual intimacy, but not detailed encoutners	20
4449	3214	I believe this is fine, because as we move on in generations we are going to find out that education about sex	21
4450	3214	safe sex, birth control, @CAPS1 prevention and testing, is much more important than trying to keep children ignorant	22
4451	3214	Keeping these young adults involved in books and trying to continue their learning outside of school is a much larger issue we should be trying to tackle instead of trying to create silly arguments against new reading material in a public libary	23
4452	3214	Public libaries are the centerpiece for learning outside of school in many communities, small and large	24
4453	3214	Knowing this, how could anyone truly believe that it would be smart to stop including new books that would entice new patrons	25
4454	3214	Even as a commercial buisness, this would make no sense, simply turning people away because you have a single view of what the future is and you refuse to listen to anyone else's opinion of the future	26
4455	3214	So why is there a question on including new knowledge	27
4456	3214	Isn't it obivous that we, as a nation, should show the world that we aren't living in the past	28
4457	3214	That we are indeed the future of the world, and that our young-adults will recieve the best education in the world by not only learning in schools, but by being the most active readers, and by extension, learners in the world.	29
4458	3215	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music,movies, magazines, should be removed off of the shelves if they are offensive	0
4459	3215	My personal opinion is that they should not be removed	1
4460	3215	unless they are so inapropreate that children should not be avle to see	2
4461	3215	That is my opinion because if readers go into the library and find an offinsive book to us might not be offinsive to him/her and his/her standards	3
4462	3215	And if it is offensive to him/her so what he/she is the one checking it out so he/she obviously knos what he/she is getting in to so there for we should not remove books off the shelves if they are offinsive, because offinsive to one is not offinsive to the other	4
4463	3215	well actually my opinion goes half and half because if the movievs and librarys are inapropreate then aldults should be the only ones to buy them	5
4464	3215	That is my personal opinion many others @MONTH1 have different opinions on this subject but i just think every thing should just stay on the shelves	6
4465	3215	And movies sold to aldults and aldults only.	7
4466	3216	Libraries are a place that provides people of all ages the oppurtunity to read any book, watch any movie, or listen to any music all for free and for a certain period of time	0
4467	3216	When people grow up, they tend to start reading, watching, and listening to material that they would never let their children listen to	1
4468	3216	Since books are read privately and movies and music are played publicly, books should not be taken from the shelves and only very bad movies and music should leave the library	2
4469	3216	Books have always been a way for people to get away from their life and into their own story world	3
4470	3216	Normally when people read a book, they don't read it in a group unless they are in a reading group discussing certain books	4
4471	3216	If someone wanted to read a book that was innappropriate for their children, let them do it	5
4472	3216	it's not hurting the children that they have been reading innappropriate topics, it will only hurt them if that child finds the book that should have been hidden in a better place	6
4473	3216	For example, @PERSON1 read the book 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2', which had some innappropriate content for a child in there, but not so bad that it would be heinous	7
4474	3216	@PERSON1 will read the book in her own mind while finding it in the adult section of the library far from children	8
4475	3216	this scenario is how it should be	9
4476	3216	Although, if a library is putting adult books near children's books, they need to redesign to keep kids from accidentally walking into the adult section	10
4477	3216	Books can be kept from kids if hidden well enough, but movies and music can not be hidden in the same manner	11
4478	3216	Movies and music are a great way to kick back and relax after a long day, unless your kids are around	12
4479	3216	Keeping kids out of the room is a near impossible task, whether it is actually watching the movie or hearing the movie through his bedroom wall	13
4480	3216	Music can of course be listened to through headphones, but what happens when you leave a @CAPS3 is left in the car and a child is sent in that car to wait for his parents to get in	14
4481	3216	The parents might tell their child to start the car for them and the music will be playing away	15
4482	3216	The movies and music were from the library, a place where the child thinks that there would never be something such disgraceful material as what their parents are watching and listening to, ruining their good thoughts of the library	16
4483	3216	Libraries need to either get rid of all nasty content pertaining to movies and music or if their main business is that and can't seem to give it up, just put the content as far away as possible from the children	17
4484	3216	As said above, libraries need to remove all content that has potential to be exposed to children and destroy their innocent minds	18
4485	3216	Libraries are a place where kids can have fun picking out whatever book they wish to read, not a place where parents can pick up items that might spoil that child's brain	19
4486	3217	Whispers and comments fill the room while people make their way throughout the library	0
4487	3217	The critialzing of books and materials that are neatly stacked in the shelves, are taken and miss treated from the harsh people that think they are offensive	1
4488	3217	In my point of view, I strongly agree that there is no right to argue about what should or should not be removed in the libraries	2
4489	3217	The reflecting of my own views along with the libraries, shows intertest in the materials for people all over the world	3
4490	3217	The reason that I, myself, do not believe in this situation is how it mentioned in Katherine Paterson's passage	4
4491	3217	It explained, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 everybody around has a unique part about themselves, and that is having a different look on something than someone else might have	5
4492	3217	This leads into taking a material or book they see, the wrong way and being offensive about it	6
4493	3217	However, there might be someone else that does not view that same exact book is wrong, but instead, see's something else that could lead to be offensive to them as well	7
4494	3217	To make this observation not as confusing, I will share my own experience that might help focuse more on my argument	8
4495	3217	There is a time when I went to the library and saw books and especially magazines throughout, that had an impact on colored people	9
4496	3217	It described how it would be like, if there was still slavery and that if everybody wasn't taught or treated equal amongst everyone else	10
4497	3217	In this situation, it could go both ways on how colored people tend to look and feel about this	11
4498	3217	Maybe the people are relieved and interested, knowing they are free now	12
4499	3217	On the other hand however, many colored people might get in an awkward position, having no passion of bringing the equiality up in the present world, or even the future	13
4500	3217	Many might want to forget about what happened, instead of books and magazines still publishing articles and stories about it	14
4501	3217	Again, this argument might go both ways, meaning one less book would be off the shelf, or many would be newly stacked aside from the others	15
4502	3217	When people think of materials, they most likly think of something that symbolizes an event, time period, or a symbol itself	16
4503	3217	This could also have an impact on the censorship in libraries	17
4504	3217	The way people want to take roll in the things they are part of, might actually be found in the library	18
4505	3217	However, someone that thinks there is no right for it to be shown, will remove the material	19
4506	3217	This tends to make the people that thought it was right, not find the interest they wanted to recieve	20
4507	3217	Another arugment people might have is that libraries are a public place, right	21
4508	3217	Well this should cut back or maybe even add more pull into what they can or can not share within their readings, materials, and movies	22
4509	3217	People might think that they have a right to argue or take the offensive actions out	23
4510	3217	Not so quick though as people can prove that they can put anything back as well	24
4511	3217	Well, instead of picking and choosing, I think everything should be left alone and people should only go to the section of interest they are looking for and leave the other materials out of their view	25
4512	3217	My experience and observations about this argument has covered why I, and all of you, should reflect on the views of censorship the approperiate way in libraries	26
4513	3217	Not saying this will control all the problems, but it will help from removing all of materials that could have a big roll in future process of taching children, teachers, and of course, each and everyone	27
4514	3218	I believe that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc	0
4515	3218	shouldn't be removed from the shelves	1
4516	3218	I say this because, what @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not come close to being offensive to another	2
4517	3218	There are many different types of books, movies and even some music that have some history to it, it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to some certain race or culture it's history	3
4518	3218	What @MONTH1 be historical or even informational to one person it will be offensive to the other and vice versa	4
4519	3218	If everybody had a chance to go into the biggest library made and take something that @MONTH1 be offensive to them down I think that the library would have little to no books in it	5
4520	3218	Katherine said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' meaning if parents or teenagers took 'offensive' material off the shelf that there will be nothing else left	6
4521	3218	A lot of things are offensive because of religion beliefs, but not everybody has the same religion or even a religion at all	7
4522	3218	Just like religion shouldn't be taught in public schools, censoring shouldn't be allowed in public libraries	8
4523	3218	If censoring did happen in public libraries, I'm sure there will be protests and possibly riots over this censoring	9
4524	3218	People said that @PERSON2 was a bad man, well if we take books and movies off the shelves showing what he did, I believe history will be more likely to repeat itself	10
4525	3218	A lot of things have been bad in history that we read about today, like gangs, if we don't read about the wrong they do or see the movies to show how it would be like if you were a gang member would there be an increase in gang activity and members	11
4526	3218	this is why I believc we shouldn't take books, magazines, movies, etc	12
4527	3218	off of the shelves	13
4528	3219	I believe that libraries should provide any kind of book, magazine, music, and movies to the public, despite if they are found offensive	0
4529	3219	First, to support my position, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore reads and prefers different types of books and magazines	1
4530	3219	The same thing applies for watching movies and listening to music	2
4531	3219	Second, what @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' to one person @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for another, so the term 'offensive' is ambiguous in this case	3
4532	3219	There is no need for an angry public or strikes	4
4533	3219	Finally, I believe that the people have a free choice when choosing the types of books and magazines to be read, the types of movies to be watched, and the types of music to be listened to	5
4534	3219	After all, it is for their own benefit, entertainment, and learning	6
4535	3219	So, libraries should not have anything offensive removed from thier shelves that are found offensive	7
4536	3219	First, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore prefers different types of materials provided by a library	8
4537	3219	For example, one person @MONTH1 like to read philosophical books, and the other @MONTH1 like to read romance comedy books	9
4538	3219	If the philosophical books were to be taken off the shelves by the library officials, then the person who likes philosophy will not have anything to read	10
4539	3219	Yes, there are magazines available and movies to watch about philosophy, but they are experienced and learned differently than reading  @ORGANIZATION2's book, or @ORGANIZATION3's @CAPS1	11
4540	3219	I had an experience similar to this with my friend	12
4541	3219	She preferred horror movies, and I historical	13
4542	3219	The horror movie she was looking for was not in the library, and later it turned out that the library did not have any kind of horror movie because they weren't popular in that city	14
4543	3219	My friend was not happy	15
4544	3219	The library had historical movies, but I ended up watching that by myself	16
4545	3219	So, libraries should not have to take away any sort of material that might be offensive to the public	17
4546	3219	Second, the term 'offensive' in this case is ambiguous, meaning that it has multiple meanings	18
4547	3219	What @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' to one person @MONTH1 not seem offensive to another	19
4548	3219	An example:  a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine cover @MONTH1 be offensive to a child because of the picture and 'adult' words for the child	20
4549	3219	However, that same cover @MONTH1 be interesting to a young adult because he @MONTH1 be into surfing, suntanning, or @CAPS2	21
4550	3219	Offensive is only used in the first part, but not in the second, and the same material was used	22
4551	3219	So, should that magazine be removed	23
4552	3219	I don't think so	24
4553	3219	The solution is for the child to look at @CAPS4 Magazines, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS5 magazines	25
4554	3219	The library should provide a section for @ORGANIZATION1 so that they can read appropriate material	26
4555	3219	Finally, I believe that the peole have a free choice when choosing the books to read, the type of movies to watch, and the types of music to listen to	27
4556	3219	They should be allowed to do this because of their differences and their definition of 'offensive'	28
4557	3219	People should not be forced to read the same type of book, to watch the same type of movies, or to listen to the same type of music	29
4558	3219	They should have a choice of choosing the materials provided by the library which corresponds to their personalities	30
4559	3219	After all, the materials they see, read, or listen to is for their own benefit, their own learning, and for their own entertainment	31
4560	3219	The main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer	32
4561	3219	In conclusion, I belive that libraries should not take off any material from their shelves that are found offensive	33
4562	3219	This is due to the different people, the ambiguous term for 'offensive', the for the sake of human flourishment	34
4563	3219	Libraries are for studying, learning, and entertainment in a quiet, peaceful place	35
4564	3219	They should not discourage people to discontinue learning about the world because that would lead to a bigger and more serious worldwide problem: the lack of education.	36
4565	3220	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our chilren or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
4566	3220	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
4567	3220	And then we have no books left on the shelf.'( Paterson) Katherine Paterson believes that if she can take a book off the shelf that she doesn't like anyone can	2
4568	3220	That should be the right way, but I don't agree	3
4569	3220	I don't think people should be able to take a book off the shelf just because they find it offensive	4
4570	3220	They don't have to take the book	5
4571	3220	I don't believe there should be censorship in libraries	6
4572	3220	If people find a book offensive they don't have to look at it or check it out	7
4573	3220	Other people might enjoy that book	8
4574	3220	Likeing a book is an opinion	9
4575	3220	For exmaple, if someone doesn't like your outfit you're probably not going to go and burn it or throw it away  because that is just that one persons opinion	10
4576	3220	That is how it goes with movies, books, music, and magazines	11
4577	3220	Everyone likes something different so their should be different books	12
4578	3220	When you don't like a book I beleive the only time it would be right for you to take that book off the shelf would be if it was in your house	13
4579	3220	Then you can take that book off the shelf and throw it away or whatever you want to do with that book	14
4580	3220	If you had the whole town vote to get rid of a book and ninety-five percent voted to get rid of that book then I think it would be okay	15
4581	3220	You can't just think about yourself when it comes to public things, you need to think about the whole community	16
4582	3220	I read an article about banning '@PERSON2' from schools, I didn't think that would be a good idea	17
4583	3220	'@PERSON2' was one of the top picked books by high school students	18
4584	3220	If parents didn't like their kids reading it they should have just told them not to read it	19
4585	3220	I don't think it's right for parents to just go in the school and say they didn't like that book and take it off the shelf	20
4586	3220	I t's not fair to other readers who enjoy reading '@PERSON2 @PERSON2'	21
4587	3220	Choosing what book to read is your opinion so you don't have to read a book you dislike	22
4588	3220	People like all different books so it's not fair for them to not able to read the book they like just because other people don't like the book	23
4589	3220	What If someone didn't like a book that you loved	24
4590	3220	Would they just be able to take it off the shelf	25
4591	3221	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found affensive	0
4592	3221	No, I do not believe that	1
4593	3221	Simply because if one person is offended by a book and or materials in a library someone else will argue because they like the thing that was taken out of place for that person's beliefs and values	2
4594	3221	I believe that if you don't like what is in the library you go to then don't go back, or just keep to yourself at least don't make a scene	3
4595	3221	There are a lot of racism being thrown around in books and songs and magazines but nobody takes that away	4
4596	3221	You just don't listen to it or you don't read it	5
4597	3221	If you would like to protest something that isn't in your beliefs or something that offends you, then go right ahead	6
4598	3221	It's good to defend yourself	7
4599	3221	I remember when I was about @NUM1, I went to a hotel in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS4 family and a family friend	8
4600	3221	And the guy @CAPS4 dad invited to come was @PERSON1	9
4601	3221	He isn't racist but he does joke about how people dress and he sometime gets out of hand with @CAPS6 comments on the racist names, but we tolerate him	10
4602	3221	So we go to check in at the hotel and the check in/ check out person at the counter was @CAPS1 @CAPS2	11
4603	3221	We pay for our room with no problem and we stand there patiently waiting for @PERSON1 to step up and ask for a room	12
4604	3221	@CAPS4 father asked him what he was doing, because he was just standing there looking at the person behind the counter	13
4605	3221	@PERSON1 looks at us and smiles, then he pulls out a pamplet from @CAPS6 shoulder bag and hands it to the girl behind the counter	14
4606	3221	@CAPS3 I have no idea what the pamplet said or what kind of pictures was on it, but when he handed it to her she dropped it, looked up at him with tears in her eyes, and flipped him off then walked to the back and got this man	15
4607	3221	As this rather large man walks around the counter towards @PERSON1 @CAPS4 father steps in the picture	16
4608	3221	@CAPS4 dad starts to talk to the guy but he doesn't seem to notice @CAPS4 dad because he was so focused on @PERSON1	17
4609	3221	@PERSON1 says, ' @CAPS3 look I was only kidding with the girl, she needs to learn how to take a joke.' @CAPS4 mom takes  me and @CAPS4 brothers up to our room and trys to get @CAPS4 father to come with us instead he promises us he'll be right up	18
4610	3221	A good half an hour later @CAPS4 dad comes through the door with @PERSON1 close behind	19
4611	3221	I asked them what was on the paper he handed the lady, and @CAPS4 father says it was an aids pamlet he got from a rest stop	20
4612	3221	I looked at @PERSON1 and I said, '@CAPS5'd you give that to her?' @CAPS6 reply was well @CAPS7 a lot of people have aids but it's kind of an iside joke about 'blacks' and aids	21
4613	3221	So I just didn't really pay much attention to him anymore and I talked to @CAPS4 father	22
4614	3221	@CAPS4 dad said the reason @CAPS5 she got so upset was because her mother died from aids just a year ago	23
4615	3221	Which of course @PERSON1 never knew about all that	24
4616	3221	But I'm sure he learned @CAPS6 lesson	25
4617	3221	He should have just left her alone	26
4618	3221	So you see these things are a problem but nobody removed us	27
4619	3221	We stayed there all weekend	28
4620	3221	Of course her and @PERSON1 exchanged some hateful looks but we looked past that, and she moved on with her life	29
4621	3221	I still don't think you should have to remove something just because someone esle don't like it	30
4622	3223	There are different types of books, movies, magnazines, and tape recorders in libraries	0
4623	3223	Books can be fiction or nonfiction	1
4624	3223	However, books or any other items can be offensive to people but to others it is just a book to read	2
4625	3223	So therefore, libraries should not remove books or any other items from the shelf	3
4626	3223	Who picks out the books, movies, magnazines, and tape recorders	4
4627	3223	The answer is the customers at the library	5
4628	3223	The authors of the books or items did not	6
4629	3223	The authors gave the decision to choice between books or items	7
4630	3223	No one can blame the authors	8
4631	3223	Also, there are different kinds and different types of writtters or artists	9
4632	3223	Writters and artists took their time for completing a novel or series for us to read or hear	10
4633	3223	People should not take it seriously about books or other source because it can be nonfiction are fiction	11
4634	3223	My next example why libraries should not remove items off the shelf is it might offensed someone but not to others	12
4635	3223	For example slavery can offensed a colored person but to others it is just a historical event	13
4636	3223	People need to know what happened in the past with historical events	14
4637	3223	People need to read the introduction before checking out the book to know if they like it or not	15
4638	3223	Therefore, people should not try to remove it	16
4639	3223	If a child checks out a book and their parents let them, it is the parents fault	17
4640	3223	It is there fault because parents let their child check the items out	18
4641	3223	Also, if a person has a problem with books or any other sources then complain but the libraries should not remove it from the shelf	19
4642	3223	Like I said before, one person might not like the book or other source but another person might like it	20
4643	3223	Libraries are for people to check out books or other sources, and not to remove books or other source off the shelves.	21
4644	3224	Why is censorship important in libraries	0
4645	3224	Why should we care if there is censorship at all	1
4646	3224	I am here to tell you today my views and opinions on cenership at the library	2
4647	3224	When you walk into a library I assume you would expect a public area where you can read books and check them out, but what happends when you browse through these books and you find something offensive	3
4648	3224	How do you act, and what should you do	4
4649	3224	In my opinion censorship is alright but only used when needed	5
4650	3224	Censorship protects childeren and young adults from viewing things that are adult eyes only such as horror books, offensive music, and in most cases pornography	6
4651	3224	Censorship in the library is an important role because anyone can go into a library and pick up any book, but when you have and adults only section for books, movies, music etc	7
4652	3224	it stops alot of people to having to worry about there kids seeing bad things	8
4653	3224	For instance, if tweleve year old @PERSON1 goes into a library and finds a video game with large amounts of violence in it he can check it out and play the game without his parents knowledge of the incident	9
4654	3224	With censorship we eliminate such problems	10
4655	3224	Now like I stated before censorship is ok when needed, because censorship can get carried away as well	11
4656	3224	In reality, its the parents fault of why there kids do things also like letting there kids listen to music with heavy swearing or full access to a personal computer	12
4657	3224	Things like that are creating problems for parents as well as people around them	13
4658	3224	When I say censorship is ok when needed I mean people censor important information on the account of a event that has happend in the past	14
4659	3224	Another example, if your in ninth grade and you enter a library for a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 movie but its to graphic the student is stranded for a source and must gain access to a computer	15
4660	3224	Now that you have my opinions and beleifs you can get a better understanding of what I mean	16
4661	3224	Censorship is a good thing but it can also be a bad one as well	17
4662	3224	I think that if censorship is controlled correctly it can become a powerful tool in any library, school, and even home	18
4663	3224	Censorship is at times out of control but maintained we can use it for many things and have a great community as well as country	19
4664	3224	In essence, Censorship is ok to and extent and you should beleive this as well just because if you think long enough you too can see what I see.	20
4665	3225	Some of the most interesting books that I have ever read are offensive in some way	0
4666	3225	I have even read excellent books that offend me	1
4667	3225	If we didn't have books and stories that offend us, then we would never really find out what offends us	2
4668	3225	That is why I don't think books, magazines, music, or anything of that nature that @MONTH1 be found offensive in some way should be remover from the shelves	3
4669	3225	If you think about, almost all books can be offensive or hurt your feelings	4
4670	3225	It just depends on how you feel about what has been written	5
4671	3225	Something that is offensive to one person or a group of people @MONTH1 not be found offensive by another person or group of people	6
4672	3225	If we took all the books off of the shelves that someone said offended them, then there would be no books left	7
4673	3225	Writing is something you do when you want to express how you feel, or tell a story about yourself or someone else	8
4674	3225	Some authors @MONTH1 do this in a very offensive manner	9
4675	3225	Others @MONTH1 try to suger-coat how they feel about a person or certain idea	10
4676	3225	Either way you could still find something about the writing to be offensive	11
4677	3225	In conclusion, i feel that books that are found offensive or hurtful should be left on the shelves because, if we took all of them off, there would not be a very wide selection of books left	12
4678	3226	Many places show and sell offensive material	0
4679	3226	It is found almost everywhere	1
4680	3226	Many people try to shelter their kids from it but the truth is if the kids really want to look at it they are going to find a way	2
4681	3226	So I do not think all offensive material should be removed from shelves but sometimes things can offend more than one person in which case they @MONTH1 need to be removed	3
4682	3226	Take music for example, there @MONTH1 be explicit lyrics in songs but that doesn't make them terrible or make them worth taking off the shelf	4
4683	3226	Music is everywhere and if someone tells you can't listen to it over a few words then they are going to find a way to listen to it	5
4684	3226	Movies @MONTH1 be different	6
4685	3226	For some you do have to be a certain age and that is because of the offensive material	7
4686	3226	But still some people go see it anyways knowing that there will be offensive material in there but they go and see it and then complain about how offensive it was	8
4687	3226	Movies should not be pulled off the shelf because it is your choice if you want to watch it or not and if you choose not to there will always be someone who chooses to watch it	9
4688	3226	Books @MONTH1 be the only exception	10
4689	3226	Many people read books and many do enjoy it but many people do find books offensive	11
4690	3226	Now with music and movies people know they aren't real its just talk or acting	12
4691	3226	But some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about	13
4692	3226	which is why some books might be pulled off shelves because if one person believes something it won't be hard to convince somebody else	14
4693	3226	There is a big difference between choosing not to look or listen to something than being told you cannot look at something	15
4694	3226	All the things that show explicit material have some type of warning for it and if you choose to keep reading or listening it is your decision.	16
4695	3227	Censorship in libraries in my view isn't a good idea	0
4696	3227	Library now days have alot of offensive language in there books so if someone were to take all of the book like that out of the library then library wouldn't even have that many books in it	1
4697	3227	Music is the same way all music now days might have some offensve words in them thats just something people now days have to get over	2
4698	3227	I think library censorship is not a good idea	3
4699	3227	Some parent might not like the idea of there librarys haveing offensive language in the books, music, movies, and magazines	4
4700	3227	If the parent don't want there children to not read those book then they need to chose there childrens book, but I think takeing all the offensive book of the shelves isn't very smart	5
4701	3227	Some people enjoy reading and listening to that kind of music	6
4702	3227	Some of the best books, and music now days have bad stuff in then like drugs, language, sex, gangs and much more but sometimes books like that can teach you a lesson on how to avoid that going down the road	7
4703	3227	So if you take those books off the shelves and werent able to listen to that music maybe your child could do some of those things	8
4704	3227	They really wouldnt know the side effects and bad thing that could come out of those things	9
4705	3227	Some of the top music and books have offensive materials in then and why would you not let your kid read them because of a couple choice word in them.I know some of this material could be bad for people but sometimes it can teach you a huge lesson in your life	10
4706	3227	If there are book you dont want youself to read then don't read them	11
4707	3227	I think it would be unfair to take everthing that have some bad language or maybe some racism away from us just because you don't think its good for your child to read	12
4708	3227	Its not fair to people who @MONTH1 enjoy those books to not have the luxary to read those book anymore cause a few parent got mad about a book	13
4709	3227	Some of the old books have alot of racism in them, and you actually @MONTH1 read some of them in a school for a class	14
4710	3227	Those book @MONTH1 also have bad language in them to	15
4711	3227	Take thing those books away from us @MONTH1 take away are education, and we won't be able to learn from those books like we should	16
4712	3227	So i think that censorshipn in library is just a horrible idea	17
4713	3227	It can take away from lesson we could learn and are education that we need to be successful in life	18
4714	3228	Censorship in libraries is a very contraversial	0
4715	3228	Many people believe that it is the right thing to do while many others strongly disagree with it	1
4716	3228	Censorship should not occur in libraries for several reasons	2
4717	3228	All people have freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1 and when books are taken off the shelf because they are thought to be offensive you are taking away that right	3
4718	3228	Authors have the right to express themselves and the right to have their works equally acknowledged by the public	4
4719	3228	Censorship is acceptable in some circumstances but what is censored should not be decided by the government	5
4720	3228	First of all, freedom of speech is very important to the people of the @LOCATION1	6
4721	3228	If this freedom were to be taken away, it would definitely not go unnoticed	7
4722	3228	When books, music, movies, and magazines are censored, the freedom of speech that the author had is being diminished	8
4723	3228	For example, what if an athiest wrote a book saying that @CAPS1 wasn't real	9
4724	3228	Many @CAPS2 would want to take this book off the shelves of all libraries	10
4725	3228	Just because one group of people do not like the topic, message, or theme of a book does not mean that it should be taken out of a library	11
4726	3228	A library is a place where all books have a chance to be read not a place where people get to pick and choose what they want there because of their beliefs	12
4727	3228	Secondly, authors have the right to express their thoughts and to have their works equally acknowleged by the public	13
4728	3228	Of course there will be books that are more popular than others, but at the same time there will also be books that are neglected not because the quality of the writing but because of the topic the author chose to right about	14
4729	3228	There is no reason to have a whole community ignore an authors work just because a  large group of people do not agree with what it says	15
4730	3228	In that small group of people that were not trying to get rid of that book you will find a number of people that would read the book	16
4731	3228	Just because a majority does not like the topic of the work does not mean that the minority should have the book taken away from them	17
4732	3228	The author has the right to what they wrote and should have the opportunity to have their work acknowledged	18
4733	3228	Last of all, censorship can also be a good thing in some circumstances	19
4734	3228	It just depends in what ways censoring is used	20
4735	3228	For example, many parents do not want their children reading, listening or watching certain things	21
4736	3228	The parents of the child should be able to decide what a kid can read, listen, or watch, not a large group of people	22
4737	3228	Many parents have different standards and what some parents find acceptable for their children @MONTH1 appall others	23
4738	3228	So, there could never be a set standard for what is acceptable and not acceptable without creating a large amount of contraversy	24
4739	3228	Once that child becomes and adult they have all the rights to decide what they want to get from a library	25
4740	3228	There should be certain limits though	26
4741	3228	For example, a person must be the age of seventeen or older to rent a '@CAPS3' rated movie	27
4742	3228	This is the same age a person must be to get into a '@CAPS3' rated movie without parental supervision	28
4743	3228	Some of the age limits throughout society should be put in libraries, but other than that, the decisions should be left up to the person	29
4744	3228	Censorship in libraries will always be changing	30
4745	3228	Sometimes it will be in effect while at other times it will not	31
4746	3228	People of the @LOCATION1 have the freedom of speech and taking away books from libraries is partially taking away that right	32
4747	3228	The author should have the right to have their book equally acknowledged by the public and kept on the shelves	33
4748	3228	Censorship should be decided by the person themselves and should not have it decided for them	34
4749	3228	Parents should have the say over what their children read and should not have that decision made by others	35
4750	3229	Have you ever been looking for a book only to find it band from all local stores	0
4751	3229	Well I haven't had the misfortune of being in that situation, but I could only imagine the sheer distress of wanting but not finding that controversial book	1
4752	3229	I personally think that a young adult should be able to read any book or news article that they wish to	2
4753	3229	The fact that a book is found offensive of offputing to most is no reason to completely ban the book from store and library shelves alike, because if there is @CAPS5 one person that could educationaly benefit from reading this book then they should at least have a chance to obtain that information	3
4754	3229	One of the most impotant things to remember while considering this topic is that no matter what the source is or what it conveys there will always be someone that feels the book is just to graphic of hits to close to home for them to stand	4
4755	3229	In other cases however, there are books that are not proper for younger children or the faint of heart, such as the book series 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which people are thrown into an arena and forced to fight each other for their very lives	5
4756	3229	Most people who are above the age of twelve can handle almost all of the 'offensive sources' that are atainable by the public, but there are some cases that @CAPS5 adults cannot handle such as the famous  book that @PERSON1 wrote in incarseration called ' @CAPS3 @CAPS4.' @CAPS5 in those extreme cases most adults can the read	6
4757	3229	Now that my argument has been said and you know my point of view is that it veries from person to person whether they can handle a book I ask you if feel the same way that I do	7
4758	3229	My main reason for this conclusion is that if someone thinks a book is too offensive they should simply avoid this book	8
4759	3229	We do live in @LOCATION1 the land of the free, I think we can a little controversy over a book or magazine	9
4760	3229	I do hope that in the future we as a nation can overcome these small setbacks that are caused by an over reaction to something offensive	10
4761	3229	I believe that we will see a day that no book will be band from the shelves, so that our children @MONTH1 gain the knoledge that is contained by thoes fragile pages of paper	11
4762	3231	I can think of several books that, I would not want a child of mine to pick up and read	0
4763	3231	I as soon as I seen what I was going to be writing about this one flashed in my head like lighting	1
4764	3231	The book that @CAPS1 choosing is called '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.'      The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' is about a young girl that grew up without a father	2
4765	3231	Her mother never wanted to talk about him because, she knew that this way only going to make matters worse	3
4766	3231	The young girl grew up with the dream of being daddy's little girl.That's all she wanted out of life	4
4767	3231	She sit and thought is that just a little to much to ask for	5
4768	3231	After a few years, had passed by she had finally got the nerve to go on a hunt for father	6
4769	3231	She went by herself, leaving her mother behind.Her mother always pumped in the head that her father was up to no good	7
4770	3231	That she would be better off without him there	8
4771	3231	But, she went on the hunt of her father by faith in the lord	9
4772	3231	After saying many prayers to the lord, she finally thought that.She just @MONTH1 knew what this hunt was going to take	10
4773	3231	So she went to her @CAPS9, hoping that she @MONTH1 just have the anwsers	11
4774	3231	That she needed to solve her heartace and pain	12
4775	3231	That she could just walk @CAPS4 knowing that somewhere out there in the world that her father would be waiting for her	13
4776	3231	It's was just before the sun was beginning to sit, when she noticed a little old southern bell	14
4777	3231	Sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair	15
4778	3231	She went up to her @CAPS9 and kissed her on the forehead,with tears filled in her eyes.Her @CAPS9 said 'now dear why must you be crying.' @CAPS8, with the lump in the throat she asked 'do you know where I @MONTH1 find my father?' @CAPS9 answered with yes	16
4779	3231	Dear, @CAPS2's laying down in his bed	17
4780	3231	That's when her face began to glow	18
4781	3231	She went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing her	19
4782	3231	She was nervous but with the help of her @CAPS9 she sit and talked with her father.Her father told her that her had wrote her a letter everyday.That's @NUM1 letters a year	20
4783	3231	She told her father that I've never recieved a letter from you in my entire life span	21
4784	3231	That's when it clicked to her that @MONTH1 be why her mother never let her check the mail	22
4785	3231	After @NUM2 years had passed by she finally found her father	23
4786	3231	Truth was that her father @CAPS3 out of his daughters life because, the mother didn't want him to be a part of her life	24
4787	3231	She did whatever it took to keep them apart, even if that meant going aganist law orders	25
4788	3231	Father explained that her mother needed her there to look after her because, her was into some heavy drugs at the time	26
4789	3231	Back then there was nothing @CAPS2 could do to take his daughter @CAPS4 from her mother	27
4790	3231	The reason I choose this book was because, when I was young my father did the same to me	28
4791	3231	@CAPS2 left me and I've never had the chance to get to know my family	29
4792	3231	The pain of growing up without either mom nor dad is tuff	30
4793	3231	You cry many tears and try to patch up the holes in you heart	31
4794	3231	Sometime's the bleed still seemeds to find it's way through	32
4795	3231	After reading the book I always wondered why they called her she	33
4796	3231	They called her she because, she took the blame for her father walking out of her life	34
4797	3231	Many children are growing up without mom or dad	35
4798	3231	There's a higher percentange of single parent family's now days than before.Just like in the book most kids take the blame for a parnet not being there	36
4799	3231	If I could take that book off the shelf, then I would because, no child needs to be reminded of the pain they went through.Would you do the same if you were looking out for your child	37
4800	3231	All these children want is to know there loved and that someone cares about them.If your going to have these types of books then there needs to be a form for the parnets to fill out giving permission	38
4801	3231	If they are over age then that's total fine	39
4802	3231	They're at the age where they should be able to handle it, than going through these feeling alone	40
4803	3232	Do you believe that certain materials,such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., offensive	0
4804	3232	Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experince, observations, and/or reading	1
4805	3232	I do believe that if it's a book you not suppose to get, if it's not for age group, don't get it	2
4806	3232	Some libraries contains books that's highly not appropriate for children, they have sections for adults and children to check out books	3
4807	3232	Some libraries need book monitors to guide and put up certain types of books.The library is  a plcae with all types of books, so you should go to your own section and check out your type of book	4
4808	3232	When I first went to the library for the time I didn't know what book to check out, so the librarian should me my section by showing me my age group	5
4809	3232	By then I was checking out books that was appropriate for my age, magazines I didn't care to much about, I just wanted to read a whloe book	6
4810	3232	In conclusion, when ever you nedd a book good or check out your section, make the book is appropriate for you and feed you mind with knowledge.	7
4811	3233	Censorship     In a library there are a plethora of books to choose from	0
4812	3233	Books ranging from children's to difficult adult ones	1
4813	3233	It's nice to know that you have many options and freedom to pick whatever book you would like to read	2
4814	3233	Censorship is the censoring of a piece of material so it is not legally or publically available	3
4815	3233	If a book was censored because of the contents inside it would bring into question other books or media related to it	4
4816	3233	I believe that if books, magazines, movies, etc	5
4817	3233	were censored in a library the material wouldn't have a chance to be exposed to people	6
4818	3233	Some people write books and songs to express themselves or make money	7
4819	3233	If a book is taken out of a library other libraries will have to remove it also, and other libraries won't buy it	8
4820	3233	Some people just wish to get there thoughts out and share their message with other people	9
4821	3233	Censorship in a way stops the flow of what people learn	10
4822	3233	Another part about censorship is where to draw the line on what is offensive enough to be censored	11
4823	3233	If a book is removed from the library for its contents, people will look into as to why it was removed	12
4824	3233	It gets people thinking as to what other books are also offensive	13
4825	3233	The reason why one book is removed could relate to another book and could get that one to be removed also	14
4826	3233	Since censorship is probably mostly opinion, there is no clear boundary as to what can sit on the shelf and what can't	15
4827	3233	With censorship you are only stripping the freedom of press away from people	16
4828	3233	If a publishing company accepts a piece of media only to have is censored later on, this might mean we need new publishers, or that they are also interested in getting what people have to say out into the world	17
4829	3233	The boundary for censorship is very opinionated and should not be dictated by a single group	18
4830	3233	When one book is taken down it only brings other ones into question	19
4831	3233	Those are my beliefs about censorship in the library	20
4832	3234	A library is a place to go when inneed of solitude and peace with researching or reading	0
4833	3234	There is no reason other than someones opion to why certain materails should be removed from libraries	1
4834	3234	We the people have a right to read what others have composed thourgh their thoughts and ideas	2
4835	3234	Certain materail @MONTH1 be offensive to different people, but to the others that could use that materail for research or for pleasure reading, would not be fair	3
4836	3234	If certain materials were removed because of someones action to there personal or religious opion, then those materials would nopt be avalible for those that would need to posess that information	4
4837	3234	Did anyone think when they asked for the certain offensive materail to be removed	5
4838	3234	If people did they would relize that someone had to put an enormous amount of effort to get that infomation out to the world	6
4839	3234	How do you think that author would feel	7
4840	3234	You just had their best work pulled from the shelfs because you think it is offensive	8
4841	3234	How would you feel if some to your best peice of writing and complained that libraries cannot put this on their shelfs because its offensive	9
4842	3234	There has been certain matierals I have listen to or read tht I thought could be offensive to certain people, but that is the media that writes the society as we read it	10
4843	3234	Some of those people @MONTH1 have certain religions that say they can't read or listen to certain things	11
4844	3234	Maybe not even watch certain materials but others, that might be there part of livlyhood	12
4845	3234	We can't just take materials off the shelfs of libraries	13
4846	3234	That material is the life blood of our society	14
4847	3234	If you cut the blood flow, bad things are bound to happen after that	15
4848	3234	For whoever reads this, remember what we produces as media is who we are, what we do , and what we live for.	16
4849	3235	Why Censorship @CAPS1 @CAPS2	0
4850	3235	In our everyday lives, we come across many things that can be taken to offense	1
4851	3235	Some of these things we might not even realize, but they're out there	2
4852	3235	Everybody doesn't want there children getting into the wrong things early on, but we know it will eventually happen	3
4853	3235	We just have to teach our kids what @CAPS1 good and what @CAPS1 @CAPS2	4
4854	3235	This goes for literary items too	5
4855	3235	We need to have faith in our kids that they will do what @CAPS1 right	6
4856	3235	I think that when old enough, they should be able to read books and listen to music that might be offensive	7
4857	3235	I think we shouldn't get rid of all the offensive material at the libraries	8
4858	3235	Now days, there @CAPS1 a lot of hard work that goes into music, movies, and books	9
4859	3235	If we start getting rid of all the offensive material, many people will be offended that in itself	10
4860	3235	The people that worked on the movie or wrote that book put a lot of time and effort into the piece	11
4861	3235	They spent countless of hours working with others just to get the piece into publication, or trying to get somone to film their movie idea	12
4862	3235	I think that it would be wrong to outrule peices of great literature because behind every one of them, there @CAPS1 a person that put a lot of effort into that material	13
4863	3235	In every book you pick up today, you could look through it and find a offensive language or offensive gestures in it	14
4864	3235	The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1 a very detailed book and has many great facts in it, but many people find it offensive because it says @PERSON2 had a wife and had children	15
4865	3235	This book isn't telling you what to believe or what actually happened, it @CAPS1 just a story full of conspiracy theories	16
4866	3235	You can still believe what you want and read this book	17
4867	3235	A movie that could be considered offensive just by the title @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 Can't @CAPS8	18
4868	3235	Many people hear this title and @MONTH1 not want to watch it, thinking that it will discriminant against @CAPS6 people, but instead it @CAPS1 a very good movie about a group of people that play basketball	19
4869	3235	Many things have offensive language but that doesn't mean we can't act like adults, read these books, and realize that they are just stories	20
4870	3235	They are not telling you what to believe and what not to believe	21
4871	3235	In our country today, we have many different ethnic groups, and many people think differently about things	22
4872	3235	In our society we are given the right to have our own opinion about things, and we are able to like what ever we want	23
4873	3235	Even though literary might be offensive, some people like reading books like this	24
4874	3235	If I look in the library, I could find a book with offensive material, but the book could still be a very good book	25
4875	3235	Even though it @CAPS1 disrcimanting against me, I could still love the book	26
4876	3235	There @CAPS1 always controversy in our society, and almost everyone loves it	27
4877	3235	Why get rid of these books when people are still enjoying them everyday	28
4878	3235	Like Katherine Paterson said, if she has the right to take a book off of the shelf, then so does everyone else	29
4879	3235	If we let everybody take books off the shelves, then there will be none left	30
4880	3235	We cannot control everything that people do	31
4881	3235	Taking offensive books out of the library will not stop people from reading them, but this will decline the library usage, and people will slowly stop reading	32
4882	3235	If they don't like the books at the library, then they won't have problem with not reading at all	33
4883	3235	I think that censorship in our libraries would be a @CAPS2 idea, and I think we should definitely not take out all the offensive material in the libraries	34
4884	3236	Books, books, and more books	0
4885	3236	There are so many of these spine bound papers, filled with everything from basic @CAPS1 about life, all the way to stories that capture the minds of faithful readers and take them to far off distant worlds	1
4886	3236	If we were to take all the books in the world and line them up in a perfect row, we would be able to create a bridge of knowledge and iformation far enough to stretch around the moon twice and back	2
4887	3236	The problem is, that with all of this @CAPS1 and knowledge, there are young minds that are not yet ready to soak it all up	3
4888	3236	There is no such thing as bad @CAPS1	4
4889	3236	There is only people who are not yet ready for the @CAPS1 they are about to obtain	5
4890	3236	So should these materials that open up doors to new minds sets, and feelings such as books, music, magazines,  and movies be censored	6
4891	3236	That answer is yes	7
4892	3236	First off, there is a certain degree of modesty and curiousity that needs to be kept in children	8
4893	3236	Children need to have a hunger for knowledge to become great learners, and intellegent minds	9
4894	3236	If the @CAPS1 given to them does not come in the chronological order of importance in which it needs to, this will poison there minds and twist them in to something they were not yet ready to become	10
4895	3236	Secondly, @CAPS1 presented to kids to early can harm them physicaly	11
4896	3236	Children are born with the instict to repete what they observe	12
4897	3236	This is a primal instict that humans will forever have, and is essential for living life	13
4898	3236	So take movies for example	14
4899	3236	If a child watches movies that involve sexual themes, and actions, this can be very harmful to them physicaly	15
4900	3236	If a child experiences these things to soon, they will want to simply repete what they saw	16
4901	3236	Then what is next	17
4902	3236	The answer to that question is easy	18
4903	3236	There will be more teen mothers than there are needed	19
4904	3236	Lastly, premature @CAPS1 can harm mentaly	20
4905	3236	Take music for example	21
4906	3236	Music is an even larger gateway to mental damage then movies are	22
4907	3236	This is simply a result of bad censorship	23
4908	3236	Many think that music is not as bad as movies because you can not see anything visually, but they are wrong	24
4909	3236	Music is even worse because children can picture what ever they want to based on what is being said in the lyrics	25
4910	3236	There needs to be tougher ristrictions on music	26
4911	3236	Restrictions such as age for purchase should be raised, That is about the only way that explicit content can be blocked	27
4912	3236	In conclusion, there should be better censorship restrictions on certain materials	28
4913	3236	But I do not beleive that the materials that @MONTH1 be harmful or offensive should be remove as whole	29
4914	3236	Simply because adults do have the right to view these materials	30
4915	3236	Libraries around the world need to better there restrictions, even laws to stop poisoning the minds of our young	31
4916	3236	We people as a whole need to come together to make this happen	32
4917	3236	After all, the children are the future of our world	33
4918	3239	I strongly believe that books with offensive things should be pulled out the library	0
4919	3239	It not okay for you too say one thing and something your child found in the library say it okay	1
4920	3239	what if you were talking to your kids about not smoke and how it bad for them and could potentially kill them, would you like you child to say that i can smoke because all this character in the book are smoking	2
4921	3239	No that not right it just pure wrong	3
4922	3239	They shouldn't allow those kinds of books, music, movies, or magazine in the library	4
4923	3239	In high school we were told by our parents that we should not smoke do drugs or anything like that	5
4924	3239	Sometimes it might be hard to believe the things your parents talked to you about and how harmful they are to you and your body and would lead you to a trouble life down the road	6
4925	3239	Movie we watch today talk about doing drugs and how cool they are and how they had fun driving a stolen car	7
4926	3239	it wrong to talk about them that way because it get teens to think it okay for them to do it and nothing bad is going to happen	8
4927	3239	The media does a bad job of showing teens it not right to do the things they see on tv	9
4928	3239	The library set a bad example by allowing those kinds of books to sit on the shelves and think it okay for people to read them and not take it offensive	10
4929	3239	I was reading a book that was talking about how they think it okay to act rascist aganist other people and say mean thing and call them bad name	11
4930	3239	I really took that offensive because i wouldnt like someone calling me name and saying bad things about me because they think it okay to say things like that and act that way	12
4931	3239	If books say all those things and the readers actually believe them, then we might have a problem in our hands because some people would take offensive to it and cause a big issue over a small book and some readers might think its okay and cause even a big issue between people who take it offensive and people who dont take it offensive	13
4932	3239	There are those people out there who think that it okay for those kind of books to be in the library and other people who think it wrong and offensive	14
4933	3239	My personal view is that i think it wrong to have those kind of books at the library	15
4934	3239	We tell people how it wrong to do bad things and how we hate certain things that are offensive to us, but it say that in the book that it alright for those thing to be happening or it right to use those foul language	16
4935	3239	I just think it personal wrong to say those kind of things in movies	17
4936	3239	music, books,or magazines are okay to be in the library yet alone in the people it self.	18
4937	3242	Censorship is a big controversy in modern society due to the fact of so many opinions being conveyed through all the new medias in the modern world	0
4938	3242	When a person has a veiw they tend to want to share it with the world or defend it againts those who opose their opinion	1
4939	3242	Some people do not always like what is being said or take offense in the way it is presented, thus causing the government, or any authority, to remove or replace these words, photos, lyrics, or film from a select public, such as children, or the entire public	2
4940	3242	This is censorship and it has caused many debates over what is acceptable in society's media	3
4941	3242	I believe censorship is wrong	4
4942	3242	It violates the @CAPS1 peoples' rights of free speach	5
4943	3242	When a person has an opinion, they have the right to voice it anyway they want	6
4944	3242	The authorities should not be involved in what someone writes, sings, creates, etc., in anyway	7
4945	3242	Censorship takes away from the integrity and purity of a human's thoughts	8
4946	3242	Who is to say what can and can't be said	9
4947	3242	Do we just let the government tell us what we can say and what is illegal	10
4948	3242	Do we stop expressing ourselves in the way we desire because it is not appropriate	11
4949	3242	No	12
4950	3242	We, as the people, must be free to say what we want in our stories and songs, along with movies and other media	13
4951	3242	If a person does not like what they see then they can turn away or they have the right to speak out against it in their own way	14
4952	3242	but they do not have the right to opress	15
4953	3242	They should write back, convey their message and try to win support, not control	16
4954	3242	Censorship is not good for any society	17
4955	3242	People want to say whatever they want and they have the right to	18
4956	3242	Censorship is not a solution to discrimation or anger, it is only a fuel	19
4957	3242	If parents do not like something and do not want their children to experience it then do not take it from them, then they should tell them how it is 'wrong' and give them their opinion and reasons so the child @MONTH1 descide what they believe in on their own	20
4958	3242	An opinion is every human being's right and it belongs to them, not the authorities.	21
4959	3243	Have you ever walked into the library hoping to find a good book, and picked up a very volgar and inapropriate article	0
4960	3243	Were you dissapointed to see what children could easily get a hold of, or did you just place it back onto the shelf just simple thinking it wasn't your style of book	1
4961	3243	In this essay I would like to discuss both views on these censored books, and why I believe they should be censored	2
4962	3243	People all over the world are vastly different	3
4963	3243	From color, race, size, shape, and personality there is not a single person on the planet who is excatly like the other, so why would they all have the same interest in reading or music	4
4964	3243	Some @MONTH1 enjoy a romantic novel that makes your heart skip beats while @CAPS1 my prefer the thrill of a horror story	5
4965	3243	Either way everyone has their own opinion of what makes a great book	6
4966	3243	The same thing accures in the question, whether or not censored items should be allowed into a public library	7
4967	3243	Many @MONTH1 say yes, people have their right to choose what they @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not observe or listen to, 'If you don't like the style in which the item is protrayed then don't pick it up.' @CAPS1 @MONTH1 say no, 'The library is suppose to be a safe haven where they don't have to worry about children seeing and hearing things they shouldn't.' In my personal opinion I believe the parent figure is right, although I also can understand the opposing opinion	8
4968	3243	As to the opposing opinion, I can understand why you @MONTH1 think that censored items are ok in libraries	9
4969	3243	If it is a personal choice of how the author writes the book and still makes a great story, I believe that the book is alright as long as it is not in reach of a child	10
4970	3243	Many people have different ideas on what censored means and there could be the consequence of loosing many books but there are always consequence to every choice, good or bad	11
4971	3243	In my personal experince, I have taken my ten year old sister to the library to barrow a movie and a few books	12
4972	3243	She is very scholary and comprehinds things quickly	13
4973	3243	Futhermore when she found a book that she thought @MONTH1 be interesting	14
4974	3243	The book turned out to be full of curse words and profanity	15
4975	3243	Think about it, what would you say to your child who just learned a few curse words from a place you expected to be a safe enviroment	16
4976	3243	To me it is rediculous to have to search every single book, cd, movie or magazine for profanity to make sure it is safe for my sister to read	17
4977	3243	Kids these days have changed majorly in their attitudes, language, and responses to things and I believe a big part of why is because of what they take in through the worldly materials	18
4978	3243	If the books and the music they read and listen to are offensive and rude then what else would they know other than to follow the lines of something more 'cool' than them	19
4979	3243	Therefore I believe that there should not be censored books in a library, and parents should have the right to ask for them to be removed	20
4980	3243	When I sit back and realize what I would want my kids to be reading and listening to I wonder why people would even chance the fact that their child could be negativly influenced by it	21
4981	3243	Why tempt them to be someone that reflects profanity and offensiveness when they could be so much more	22
4982	3243	Parents should do everything they can to make their kids the best person they can be and I believe that they have a right to protect their children from not reaching their full potential	23
4983	3243	Therefore in the end books should be censored!	24
4984	3246	I do in deed believe that certain material should not be in public libraries, or places where young people can see it	0
4985	3246	Things, such as pornagraphic material should not be out in the open where kids can see it	1
4986	3246	I think we would all believe the same way when we say that kids do not need to be seeing these things	2
4987	3246	I personaly have been in a movie rental shop, and seen some of the movies that my parents would not want me to see	3
4988	3246	Material such as this should be put away somewhere out of sight, and requested if wanted	4
4989	3246	I also have a religious view on all of this	5
4990	3246	I know that it is a sin to look at the things such as porn and so the people in charge of the shop, or library ought to respect me and my religion	6
4991	3246	@PERSON1 in the @CAPS1 says that if eating meat causes his brother to stumble than he will not do so	7
4992	3246	We need to have the same aspect on life	8
4993	3246	If something causes someone else harm we should not do it	9
4994	3246	This is an issue that we face every day, and the reason I am using pornagraphic material is because it is everywhere	10
4995	3246	If I am standing in the @ORGANIZATION1 check out line I see the people magazines and I find it verry offensive	11
4996	3246	I will say though, if you are old enough to live by yourself than you can look at whatever you want	12
4997	3246	I just find it untollerable to post these materials were viewers who do not want to see them have to see them.	13
4998	3247	Do you believe that certain materials in the library should be removed off the shelf if found offensive	0
4999	3247	I believe certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	1
5000	3247	Some of my reasoning is very logical and if you were a reader I'm sure you want to read something thats true and very interesting	2
5001	3247	Libraries all consist of books from everything you can think of	3
5002	3247	Libraries are really for learning and not to offense anybody in any manner	4
5003	3247	The reason why I believe they should not be removed because everybody is equal and not everybody likes to read the same books	5
5004	3247	There should be offensive books because I think that theres just to many kids that would not like to grab a book and it be orginal and not offensive about them in some way	6
5005	3247	Books are created to read and have interest, laughter, enjoying	7
5006	3247	From some of the students at my school I spoke with said that when they are really having a bad day they turn on their music and it helps them because it makes them feel alot better and the day gets easier for them	8
5007	3247	They say they dont have to be depressed or thinking about something that made them mad that day	9
5008	3247	Well as in from my experience with books I can tell you somethings and sometimes that when I was feeling down how I grabed a book	10
5009	3247	The first time I realized books are really helpful and I'm also talkling about magazines, music and movies	11
5010	3247	Well to be honest I'm not a big reader	12
5011	3247	I enjoy listening to music because sometimes songs can relate to you and make you fell  that your not alone	13
5012	3247	Also it helps you learn how to cope with some things that you could of never coped with before because it makes you feel relaxed	14
5013	3247	Just how some of my friends said that they feel relaxed when they read a book	15
5014	3247	So my point is that you know and I know that their are music out there that is very offensive and some books that are	16
5015	3247	Does it drive us crazy that they do	17
5016	3247	No it does not because it actually helps us	18
5017	3247	It helps us by showing us away out from our daily streesful lifes and sometimes you learn in books and songs of how other people deal with their stress	19
5018	3247	So you learn alot of things than feel offensive about books or music	20
5019	3247	As you can tell I'm a huge music fan and there has been lots of songs that were offensive but it did not bug me much	21
5020	3247	I hope I gave you some kind of shock that music and books should'nt be removed if offensive	22
5021	3247	It's just music is amazing as well for books we all need our space sometimes and those two things are just there for us which is either to help us learn or feel relaxed and calm	23
5022	3247	Thank you for reading this and I hope I persuaded you enough with my reasoning	24
5023	3247	Remember music and books are alot alot of fun and if you never gave it a chance, you should try it sometime	25
5024	3247	That's the end of my conclusion	26
5025	3248	No, I don't think books are offensive in librarys	0
5026	3248	Movies are a different kind of story if you child is under the age of eighteen they should not be renting a rated @CAPS1 movie, unless their parent approves of it	1
5027	3248	This is one reason why our public library should not have rated @CAPS1 movies	2
5028	3248	While i was in our public library one afternoon I was looking at the movie selection, i was tring to decide which movie to chose	3
5029	3248	There was a little boy, at the age of nine or ten it looked liked to me, but he had two movies in his hand	4
5030	3248	They looked really good it was an action type movie, so i asked the boy if i could see the movie really fast	5
5031	3248	He asid yes, so i grabbed it from him and looked at the rating because from the title picture it looked gory	6
5032	3248	I noticed it was a rated @CAPS1 movie, and i told the boy did u know this is a rated @CAPS1 movie and he said yes, I was surprised his parents would let him watch movies like that, if i was his age i would never been able to	7
5033	3248	My second reason why our public library should get rid of any kind of swimsuit magazines like @CAPS5 and/or @CAPS6 magazines	8
5034	3248	I was looking at the magazine rack one day and noticed magazines like @CAPS5,swimsuit magazines and many more	9
5035	3248	Do you think your children should not have seen any kind of magazines like that in our libray for the public to see	10
5036	3248	If a little girl went to the magazine rack and saw that magazine, she would either want to look at it or act like she not even noticed it	11
5037	3248	At her age she wants someone to look up to and if she sees a model on or in the magazine she would want to possibly look like her, so this is how eatting disorders start	12
5038	3248	This is the  reason why library's should get rid of any kind of magazines under that catagory	13
5039	3248	These are the reason why I think our local library should get rid of rated @CAPS1 movies and/or Magazines like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6	14
5040	3248	If you agree with me contact your libray and tell them what i have told you today	15
5041	3248	@MONTH1 we put a stop to censorship in our librarys.	16
5042	3249	There is a type of boundary that @MONTH1 restrict readers from gathering knowledge about certain things in books	0
5043	3249	This is called censorship	1
5044	3249	However @CAPS3 you @MONTH1 not have known is that it is thought about in every school and every public library	2
5045	3249	@CAPS3 would you do if you saw your child reading a book that contained frightening descriptions that are to horrrific or to adult like for their own good	3
5046	3249	This is the question that plauges them every year with new shipments of books	4
5047	3249	Although yes that seems terrifying it is not right to take books off the shelf for a few reasons	5
5048	3249	The congressional law allowing us to have freedom of press, freedom of thought, and the fact children must take in  all the knowledge they can to be the best they can achieve	6
5049	3249	First of the arguements that can be held is the freedom of press	7
5050	3249	This law was enacted in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and is still in effect today	8
5051	3249	If an individual wanted to write a book that was not for children then he or she @MONTH1 do so without penalizations	9
5052	3249	Children @MONTH1 read it yes, but that shouldn't be blamed on the author	10
5053	3249	If so then that person would never get any royalties for their story and no money to support themselves	11
5054	3249	It's hard to get upset with your children for learning something wrong, but it's not right to blame the writer	12
5055	3249	When it comes to the arugements of @CAPS3 to do on censorship the freedom of thought pops into most minds	13
5056	3249	This is another law that says citizens are allowed to think @CAPS3 they will of anything	14
5057	3249	Just as the freedom of press an indiviudal can pick up that book for adults and read it	15
5058	3249	No matter the age they are	16
5059	3249	If they are discouraged by it then by all means let them put it down, however, if they enjoy the read and the more unique wording than in childrens novels let them continue learning	17
5060	3249	A child can absorb many things and recall them at times where adults sometimes cannot remember	18
5061	3249	This is not scientificly proven but when you are around children constantly you notice this	19
5062	3249	Just as a babies mind is a sponge it still continues to gather all of the information it possibly can during its pre-teen years	20
5063	3249	When they are allowed to read any book and not sit infront of a television screen all day they learn more	21
5064	3249	Now someone can come along and say:  '@CAPS3 if the book is a fantasy?'	22
5065	3249	It's no different	23
5066	3249	The storyline is not @CAPS3 teaches them, it is the words and how they are used that is knowledge	24
5067	3249	An educated man can sometimes get tounge-tied with words where as if someone who did not do well in school or college read quite a bit they are able to use words with great ease	25
5068	3249	It is not allways the case, but wouldn't you like your own child to sound intelligent while speaking during important events	26
5069	3249	All in all it seems to be a great waste when censoring books for the public	27
5070	3249	There can be great things in those books that not everybody can reap	28
5071	3249	Pulling them off the shelf could mean that you impede someones ability to learn a new word or gramatical law	29
5072	3249	If one parent could pull a book off a shelf then another could do it and soon you would not have any books	30
5073	3249	It would be a scary day if that happened	31
5074	3249	For it would not be something that went well in our history	32
5075	3249	Since humankind has had writing we became more intelligent, taking books off all of the shelves would revert us to primitive beings	33
5076	3249	So keep the books on the shelves even if children should not read them	34
5077	3249	Not just because they can learn far greater with a book as a resource, but that the two congressional laws say it should be	35
5078	3251	If everyone in the world could permantly take a book, movie,music, etc., off the shelf because they think it is offensive would there be any of those thing left for us to enjoy	0
5079	3251	I personally think that if people could do that they would, but is everything someone else finds offensive really offensive to you	1
5080	3251	No, it might not be, so does that give that person the right to pull it off the shelf permanatly so no one else can read it	2
5081	3251	I think no one has the right to pull that item off the shelf because of there own opinion of it	3
5082	3251	If anyone could do that would there ever be uniqueness in people	4
5083	3251	I dont think there would be	5
5084	3251	Just because you think the music a person listens to is offensive does not mean they think the same	6
5085	3251	Thus it shouldnt be taken away from that person if he/she enjoys listening to it	7
5086	3251	On the other hand I understand that some people might listen to music or read books that has offensive language and that they would not want there children hearing or reading that but that does not mean the music or book should be pulled from the shelf	8
5087	3251	Ask yourself if you would react the same way to a person who uses offensive language what should we do then	9
5088	3251	You can just take that person out of the world	10
5089	3251	So I guess the point im trying to get across is that just because you think its offensive and dont like it doesnt mean everyone in the world thinks that	11
5090	3251	To end my acticle I want you to think about whats offensive to you @MONTH1 not bee the same for others.	12
5091	3252	The contents of the books in libraries vary in many way	0
5092	3252	Some are children's books, some are adult books, and some are in between	1
5093	3252	Libraries have books that spark interest in a reader	2
5094	3252	Not all books are made for a particular age group or gender	3
5095	3252	Which that should not mean that a library should be picked apart because of the contents of the novel,magazines,music,or movies	4
5096	3252	A library is suppose to be for anyone that enjoys to read a variety of materials, not just a select few because some people don't like the text or the meanings behind that book , song, or movie	5
5097	3252	In the library, in our little town, splits up the variations of the reading materials,music,and movies	6
5098	3252	There is a children's section, that has all the books we all grew up with, in half the building	7
5099	3252	Also an audult section for larger novels topics that teens and younger children would have no interest in or their parents would want them reading	8
5100	3252	Another great thing is that they have books for people in between, like myself, with teen books that spark our interest	9
5101	3252	With the ideas that people are writing about today we can not possible control what comes to their mind	10
5102	3252	Some of the greatest books that are out are probably have the deepest meanings that some audiences don't prefere to listen to	11
5103	3252	But that is what is so great is that people have the liberty to go and find a book, or a magazine, or even @CAPS1 that they like.When freedom of what you read is taken away reader will stop reading	12
5104	3252	Doesn't the admisistrations of schools want kids to read to get their test scores up	13
5105	3252	If you take away what they like to read doesn't that mean they will stop reading	14
5106	3252	Also doesn't that mean the test scores will go down	15
5107	3252	In my experience of topics that I have read about have been more grown up than my mother would like,but the fact of it is, is that people will read what they want	16
5108	3252	People don't like to be told no in my personal experience	17
5109	3252	Taking away topics that are well liked even with words or contents of what they are reading is not fair to the readers	18
5110	3252	I believe that they should not censor books, music, movies, magazines, etc	19
5111	3252	because that would mean the libraries would be gone	20
5112	3253	If something offensive is found at the library, should it be taken off of the shelves	0
5113	3253	Some people might look at this question and instantly say yes	1
5114	3253	Others might not think anything of the item and move along	2
5115	3253	I disagree with those who believe the item should be remove	3
5116	3253	Instead, I believe the item should not be removed and stay on the shelves	4
5117	3253	As a child, I have always gone to the child's section of the library to find a book	5
5118	3253	I steared clear of the 'grown-up' area	6
5119	3253	So if my mother found an offensive item on the shelves she would make sure I didn't see it	7
5120	3253	I believe if the parent watches what their child sees then they wouldn't worry about them seeing something offensive	8
5121	3253	However, let's say that an adult sees this item and feels it should be removed	9
5122	3253	She/he has the right to remove that item but what if, to someone else, that item was exactly what they were looking for	10
5123	3253	The world we live in has many offensive things in it that we see everyday, such as newspapers, @CAPS1 programs, billboards, etc., and if someone were to come along and take it all away, we would have nothing left but that one persons interests	11
5124	3253	This is why we have a little bit of everything in our libraries	12
5125	3253	If there is an offensive book or a bad @CAPS2 and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is @CAPS3 but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like	13
5126	3253	I have always heard the saying, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I find this to be completely true	14
5127	3253	If everybody liked the same thing, then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item	15
5128	3253	However, if this happens, authors won't want to keep writing books and singers won't want their @CAPS4 there if they find out someone keeps removing their work	16
5129	3253	On the same note, people won't want to go to the library if they know they won't find what they want because someone took it down	17
5130	3253	I disagree with the ones who feel the item should be removed because to someone that book might be perfect	18
5131	3253	I believe that the book or magazine or @CAPS2 should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it	19
5132	3253	If a person walks by and feels the book is offensive, they need realize that to someone else it might not be and walk away	20
5133	3253	I am sure people would find my choice of books offensive or bad and would like to remove them from shelves	21
5134	3253	However, I would stop going to the library if that happened	22
5135	3253	This is why I feel books should stay where there are	23
5136	3254	Censorship, or the removing of material deemed inappropriate or offensive, has been used as a means of controlling people's thoughts and feelings for many centuries	0
5137	3254	The @CAPS1 used it in the @CAPS2 colonies during the @CAPS2 @CAPS4 to keep the colonists loyal to the crown	1
5138	3254	The @CAPS5 used censorship not just during the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 as a brand of propaganda, but also during @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS11 under @CAPS12 guidance	2
5139	3254	Censorship is still in use in the @LOCATION1 today, as a way to 'protect the children'	3
5140	3254	The @ORGANIZATION1 tells the @CAPS2 public what we can and cannot watch on television and what we can and cannot listen to on the radio	4
5141	3254	Other organizations tell us what books we can and cannot read, what video games we can and cannot play, and what items we can and cannot buy	5
5142	3254	Such organizations, I believe, are pushing the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 and other freedom-loving nations to the edge of totalitarianism	6
5143	3254	As Katherine Paterson stated, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' If one person has the right to control what we buy, what we listen to, and what we see, then how come we don't have that right to control the same things for them	7
5144	3254	Where do we draw the line	8
5145	3254	Eventually, all books, movies, magazines, music, and video games would be deemed offensive and inappropriate	9
5146	3254	Culture would slowly wither and die, and our lives would become drab and essentially useless, for lack of a better term	10
5147	3254	I recently read a book titled '@CAPS14', by @PERSON2, about two periods in a boy's life: his childhood with his family in tribal @LOCATION2, and the life he had after his mother's death in the @CAPS15 capital of @LOCATION3	11
5148	3254	@PERSON2's work includes some passages that are less than angelic, and, had strict censorship been in place, these passages would have caused the book to go unpublished	12
5149	3254	@PERSON2's work gave not only myself but a multitude of others insight into the life that @CAPS16 face in the changing landscape of their @CAPS7, and it certainly made me realize once again that I have a life rich in family, friends, and comfort	13
5150	3254	All in all, censorship is a horrid disease that slowly infects and consumes every part of our lives	14
5151	3254	If you get to censor something you find offensive, then why don't I do the same thing	15
5152	3254	Some censorship is good, and a fact of life	16
5153	3254	But we have to ask ourselves, where do we draw the line	17
5154	3254	Where's the boundary between safety and and outright police state	18
5155	3254	Censorship is just a fancy term for blatant disregard of the @CAPS17, as freedom of speech is guaranteed for all @CAPS2 citizens	19
5156	3254	As a famous colonial revolutionary once said, '@CAPS19 me liberty, or @CAPS19 me death!' If censorship continues to grow and our libraries grow emptier and emptier, then I shall take death over liberty, for liberty with censorship is no liberty at all.	20
5157	3255	If any book, music, movies, magazines, etc	0
5158	3255	should be offensive to anybody don't even bother to look at the material	1
5159	3255	Even if you might find it interesting, in then end you find out that it is offensive to you then just take it the other direction	2
5160	3255	No material of books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the materials because authors, directors, and music writers have made it their creation	3
5161	3255	Nobody has the same views as everybody else, each person is different in their own way	4
5162	3255	Then why is it so bad when they have offended you if it wasn't intentional	5
5163	3255	Each individual has their own opinion of each material	6
5164	3255	It might be offensive to somebody else, but to another person it might not even effect their views about what they've read, seen, or heard	7
5165	3255	Others @MONTH1 have to realize that even if its written down it is not directed towards the person reading it, if they have tooken it the wrong way	8
5166	3255	Even if your just making an observation just walk away and do not let it get the best of you	9
5167	3255	Don't let anybody tell you different of your own opinion	10
5168	3255	The cenorship in libraries are not made just for you, they are made for everbody around you	11
5169	3255	If you do not like a book in the library or even think it is inapropriate then just walk away and put it down	12
5170	3255	Anything in the library shouldn't be removed, just because you didn't like it doesn't mean that somebody else will find it interesting	13
5171	3255	If you find any material offensive then maybe you should think in your head of ways to make an argument to prove the authors that they are wrong	14
5172	3255	You just have to be strong and take anything that comes your way, and you have to be ready for it	15
5173	3255	I go to the library once in a while,and most of the time i'm just looking around for something to read and I find something interesting and I pick it up	16
5174	3255	Once I start reading it, and if I feel  the type of material is directed towards me and I find it offensive I just leave it along and put it down	17
5175	3255	I don't take it the wrong way because I know it isn't a serious type of matter, because it didn't have my name in the book	18
5176	3255	So, why should I get worked up about it if it isn't about me	19
5177	3255	I don't take any type of material that I'm looking at in any negative way because I know that someone else's opinion and not my own	20
5178	3255	If anybody takes it the wrong way then they should look at other things about the topic and put your own opinion on the topic	21
5179	3255	Anybody should know that your own opinion matters than anything else or anybody else	22
5180	3255	The littlest things shouldn't get to anybody, especially if it doesn't matter	23
5181	3255	It doesn't change how you feel about the topic	24
5182	3255	The way you feel about it should not affect the way other people feel see it	25
5183	3258	Library @CAPS1:                                    @CAPS2 or bad	0
5184	3258	It is a very rare occasion that i go to the library, i'm a typical guy, i like sports, video games, and hanging with my friends	1
5185	3258	When im not in school i try to stay away from everything that reminds me of it, like libraries	2
5186	3258	Those very rare occasions when i do go to the library, for a summer reading book for school, i usually browse around to see what they have on the shelves	3
5187	3258	Some of the stuff i see at libraries catches my eye, and not because it looks like a @CAPS2 book, but because it's shocking to see what they allow to be even put on the shelves	4
5188	3258	On the book shelves that i have walked by i have seen romance novels and they arent as bad as i would have thought, at first they catch my eye with the titles because they are usually kind of out of the ordinary	5
5189	3258	I feel that these books aren't innapropriate for young adults, but younger kids and pre teens should'nt be reading them	6
5190	3258	So as long as there is seperation between the kids section and adult section then i think it is completely okay to have romance novels and any other graphic novels up on the shelves because they are types if literature	7
5191	3258	Now magazines on the other hand can be taken either way	8
5192	3258	Gossip magaziines can be entertaining, but they can also be highly offensive	9
5193	3258	The problem with magazines alot of the writing is people's opinions and they could be talking in a very negative wasy about some people or some things	10
5194	3258	I think its up to the library to make a decision on that but if someone complains about it i think the library should be kind enough to take it off of the shelf	11
5195	3258	They are also magazines that show off models in swimsuits and clothes, and i feel that if the guys or girls are nude at all in the magazine they should either be in a back room and have people request to see them or they shouldn't be in the library at all	12
5196	3258	I've seen parents walk into a library and their son asked them why that magazine had a half naked lady on it and i just felt like it was highly irresponsible for the library to just leave these magazines out for kids to see them and then bug there parents all day about what they saw at the library	13
5197	3258	Music and movies are not that hard to control from them getting into the wrong hands	14
5198	3258	Now a days @CAPS3 cases for music have stickers on them that say parental advisory, so i feel that the library should be able to have any types of music on the shelves because music now has warnings on the cases	15
5199	3258	Movies are the same way, they have ratings	16
5200	3258	If the librarian see's a @NUM1 year old kid trying to check out a rated @CAPS4 movie then she should be fired, because there is cleary no reason why she would do that	17
5201	3258	Excuses cant come into play here because if you look at the rating and then you look at the person you can usually see if the movie is appropriate for them or not	18
5202	3258	Now @CAPS5 movies should not be in libraries at all, libraries are supposed to be a place to get something nice to read or listen to	19
5203	3258	Pornography in a library is like haveing strippers in school, it is just not ethical	20
5204	3258	In conclusion i feel that cencorship in libraries is a @CAPS2 thing to have	21
5205	3258	If libraries organize things well and make sure kids aren't in ares that they shouldn't be then everything should be fine	22
5206	3260	'@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 I like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and I can not lie, when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waste and a round thing in your face you get sprung.' @CAPS2 song in itself depicts a rather provocative tone towards women and men	0
5207	3260	While '@CAPS3 a'las what sorrows can be seen over yonder' tells us that love can be found anywhere	1
5208	3260	Now look closly at both lymrics you will eventually see a connection in both	2
5209	3260	The rap song @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is about a man that finds love in large glutius maximi while the other says that love can be seen everywhere, and anywhere	3
5210	3260	To say that music, magazines, books, and more should be banned is to say that throwing an @CAPS6 flag on the floor is just okay	4
5211	3260	Well its not	5
5212	3260	banning books, music, etc	6
5213	3260	is just like cencoring someones imaginationa and creativity	7
5214	3260	It is just like the book @DATE1, where @CAPS4 @CAPS8 is watching, and that we are only based on what we are allowed to read, and even think	8
5215	3260	Taking away movies and books, is to not allow people to learn from their past	9
5216	3260	Take @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for example, though that movie is rather gory and morbid, it still tells us of the horrors of the time during @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @NUM1 and that the past is never something that should be let go	10
5217	3260	Always remeber the past so you can learn from it	11
5218	3260	Had that movie been cencored or removed I personally would have never learned about the hardtimes of the @CAPS13 and what it can do to a persons soul and emotions	12
5219	3260	A book, magazine, movie, etc are all gateways to new worlds, where children can use their imagination and justify what their personality is	13
5220	3260	I can say that books and songs have saved lives	14
5221	3260	The other day a friend of mine was on the edge of suicide and was almost a squeeze away from pulling the trigger when I told him that what he was doing was wrong	15
5222	3260	I was @NUM2 at the time, and i rushed through my ipod to find a song '@CAPS14 to @CAPS15 a @CAPS16' by the @CAPS17	16
5223	3260	I basically read him the lyrics and he eventually put the idea of sucicide away	17
5224	3260	While yes, there aresongs & books like The @CAPS18 and the @CAPS19 that @MONTH1 have provoked people to do crazy things, even to kill	18
5225	3260	We stilll see more good being done and shown through reading and writing	19
5226	3260	Because they are all ways to express ourselves	20
5227	3260	A song can @CAPS15 a @CAPS16 as much as it can take one away	21
5228	3260	Even then we can that letting imagination flow is better than letting the imagination get cencored	22
5229	3260	If a book is seen as something unwanted or taken away, it will cause more harm in that it would be wanted more, it would be craved becasue it is an unreachable thing	23
5230	3261	The world today in the @LOCATION1 is hardly free	0
5231	3261	Everything that we see, hear, and read is censored	1
5232	3261	Is this good or bad	2
5233	3261	For the most part, it is good	3
5234	3261	Adults, teenagers, and young children all should only be allowed access to certain types of movies, music, books, magazines, radio stations, and so on	4
5235	3261	I don't believe they should be removed, but I do believe these materials should have limited access	5
5236	3261	Some materials are kind of hard to keep from children and teenagers, but I believe what is kept from children is up to children's parents to say whether or not the children can watch, look at, or listen to what ever it @MONTH1 be that is concidered offensive to some people	6
5237	3261	Some materials are and should continue to be censored, but to an extent	7
5238	3261	If a person were to watch an @CAPS1-@CAPS2 movie or even unrated at a movie theater, that person would have to be @NUM1 years of age or older	8
5239	3261	That is the law, and I believe this is a good thing	9
5240	3261	Parents should, also, definitely be the one's to censor what children watch, see, hear, or read	10
5241	3261	Children for the most part don't know any better	11
5242	3261	Children are curious little beings	12
5243	3261	If there is something that a parent has laying around the house that the child has never seen before that child will immediately wonder what this material is	13
5244	3261	If it were a magazine, they might look at it	14
5245	3261	I believe that there is a certain age to be allowed to look at these things, because there are a lot of materials in this world that are meant for adults only	15
5246	3261	These materials have to be kept open to the public or else all the people who don't find these materials bad would be broke because people fight for what they believe in and that costs money, especially if the people want to take their opinion as to why they should be able to see or hear whatever they want to because they are an adult and they are mature enough to participate in these activities	16
5247	3261	The people who fight for what they believe in would need a lawyer	17
5248	3261	Lawyers have to be paid or else they will not work for you	18
5249	3261	There are a lot of people around the world who know what they believe is good and bad	19
5250	3261	It's all in how these people being are raised, and were raised as a child themselves	20
5251	3261	If people believe something is bad, then they don't have to read, listen to, look at, or watch any of the things they find offensive	21
5252	3261	These activities are only for the people who do not have a problem with seeing or hearing these materials, therefore these materials should be censored, but only to a certain extent	22
5253	3261	If everything in this world that even one person found offensive were removed, then, what about all of the other people who do not find those materials offensive	23
5254	3261	What about the adults who find no harm in seeing or hearing these things	24
5255	3261	Not every person in this world has the same opinion	25
5256	3261	In conclusion, not everything should be censored	26
5257	3261	The materials children see and hear is up to parents	27
5258	3261	People will fight for their freedom to see and hear what they want because people know what they want and will get it any way they have to	28
5259	3261	This is @LOCATION2, let's not be overly strict about things.	29
5260	3262	How many of you have ever heard any offensive language	0
5261	3262	Seen somthing that you think no other kid should see	1
5262	3262	Im going to guess a lot	2
5263	3262	Almost every person in the world has heard, said, or seen something that they shouldn't have	3
5264	3262	Most hear curse words before they can even walk	4
5265	3262	If you can't keep kids from hearing or seeing anything offensive then why would you try and edit what they read in libraries	5
5266	3262	After all it is a public place where anyone can go to read in peace	6
5267	3262	Almost every person in the world has said or done something wrong, but they learn from it	7
5268	3262	It allows them to mature and grow up	8
5269	3262	Children learn new words all their life and are bound to come across some that shouldn't be said	9
5270	3262	Yet, most will and see what happends and learn from it	10
5271	3262	If you take out things like that in the books they read, then how will they learn	11
5272	3262	The books that children read varys	12
5273	3262	The younger kids wont know what bad words are until they get older	13
5274	3262	The books that older kids read @MONTH1 have words in it to display a seriouse part to the story, or a tragic monment in the characters life	14
5275	3262	Some @MONTH1 even tell of what happens when the characters says a bad word and what happens to him if he says it	15
5276	3262	Authers usally vary their vocabulay in the stories that they write	16
5277	3262	If they are writing about the @DATE1's why would they try and clean up the grammer that was spoken from that time	17
5278	3262	Try and change what the reader might think about that time	18
5279	3262	Leave the libraries' books on the shelves no matter what is in them	19
5280	3262	Kids always see and hear someing oddensive no matter how hard their parents try	20
5281	3262	Books use words to display important parts of a story and our history	21
5282	3262	Books need to stay put in the libraries that they are in	22
5283	3263	Censorship of @CAPS1 of @CAPS2            'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
5284	3263	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
5285	3263	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' is a quote from Author, Katherine Paterson	2
5286	3263	She is saying that there are some books that most people would think to be a little graphic or shocking, but we can not take those books off the shelf because then eventually there would be no books left to read	3
5287	3263	I agree with her in the sense that we can not take certain books off the shelves in our library	4
5288	3263	We can not take them off the shelves because that would be taboo in many ways	5
5289	3263	It would be stepping into hot water because the people would be violating the authors freedom of the press, who would decide what material was right and wrong, and how far is too far when it comes to censorship	6
5290	3263	These are just a few of the many reasons this is wrong	7
5291	3263	Taking certain books of shelves would be against our constitution	8
5292	3263	The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 gives all @CAPS5 citizens the freedom of the press	9
5293	3263	This means that they can write anything that they want without having to worry about the government's or the citizens' opinions	10
5294	3263	If we start taking certain books off shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 include a few controversial things we are violating there natural right	11
5295	3263	Which leads me to my next argument in if we do allow censorship, who should be in charge	12
5296	3263	So many people want to include their opinions on what is right and what is wrong	13
5297	3263	So, who are we supposed to believe	14
5298	3263	On person @MONTH1 think somthing is out of line, but the person standing next to them would think it is ordinary	15
5299	3263	That is what makes this country great	16
5300	3263	We are a mixture of many different ideas that work together for a common goal	17
5301	3263	If the government would assign someone to censoring books, magazines, or music, there would be a uproar	18
5302	3263	How can one person say if something is wrong	19
5303	3263	And if someone was allowed to censor things, what would be included	20
5304	3263	How far is to far	21
5305	3263	This is a hard question to ask	22
5306	3263	If we were to allow one person to judge things what should be included	23
5307	3263	Would the judgement stop at just books, movies, and music	24
5308	3263	Or would it expand to judgement of clothes and lifestyles	25
5309	3263	If we implement this system of censorship, our who lives would become one big judgement	26
5310	3263	Self expression would go out the window because people would be scared of being deemed 'inapropriate.' Our world would become a puzzle of trying to fit in and to not be noticed, rather than standing out and pushing the human race forward	27
5311	3263	There are always going to be those people who disagree with things	28
5312	3263	They find it out of place or offensive	29
5313	3263	What we have to realize is that everyone views things in different ways	30
5314	3263	We as people need to learn to accept something out of the ordinary, and try to understand where otheres are comming from	31
5315	3263	If we can do that our world would be a much better place	32
5316	3265	A very wise man in @CAPS1 life once said, 'The only way to escape temptation, is to remove the temptation all together.' @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON2, while growing up had poor influences all around him	0
5317	3265	@CAPS4 went to a run-down school, lived in a crime torn neighborhood, had a drunk for a @CAPS2, had no mother around to help him and had an older brother that often beat him and hurt him, emotionally and physically	1
5318	3265	As @CAPS4 grew up there were temptations to do the wrong thing morally all around him	2
5319	3265	@CAPS4 had no example of how to behave, yet @CAPS4 stayed away from @CAPS3, tobacco, drugs, guns, prostitutes, violence and fighting, and even something as 'minor' as pornography	3
5320	3265	As I have been growing up with @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as a hard working individual and having @CAPS1 mother around to help me with school work and preparing for college, the truth shows how times have changed	4
5321	3265	Just before I was born, @CAPS1 parents moved out of the old crime riden neighborhood and out of the city for that matter	5
5322	3265	We moved to the suburbs where crime is more rare and mostly just misdimeaners	6
5323	3265	@CAPS1 @CAPS2 told me one day, 'I'm scared by how the times have changed	7
5324	3265	When I was a kid, fowl language was un heard of in songs and music but now-a-days the songs seem to be about nothing but sex, drugs, killing people, and even about rape	8
5325	3265	At this rate I'm scared of the thought of what you're kids are going to see, son.' @CAPS4 had a valid point	9
5326	3265	In our curent days the youth can go to even the public library and get books on illegal drugs and movies with sex scenes and music that talkes about killing law enforcement officers	10
5327	3265	What has the world come to when a child of age eight @MONTH1 walk into a public library and check-out a book on cocaine	11
5328	3265	The worst part is that they can just read these books while browsing, they don't actually have to check the book out	12
5329	3265	A quote from the author Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I believe that rather than hoping they don't pull the book off the shelf that we should just remove the book from the shelf and @CAPS5 have the book there at all	13
5330	3265	Public libraries are marked as safe places for children and adults to go to if they feel thretened or endangered	14
5331	3265	Well what if @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as a parent feels thretened by the fact that there are evils out in the world and they have become so accepted by todays society that they are even found in the public library	15
5332	3265	Then what	16
5333	3265	Public libraries and other public resourcess should be controled and monitored about what they allow into their doors	17
5334	3265	A parent SHOULD @CAPS5 have to hope that his or her child doesn't pick up a book about an inapropriot topic while in public but should know that that is @CAPS5 the case	18
5335	3265	Parents should be able to relax and rest asured that their child is safe from the filth of inmoral things	19
5336	3266	When I was in seventh grade I had a mission to read every @PERSON1 book I could get my hands on	0
5337	3266	Some of the material in her books proved to be a little too racy for most middle schoolers and some parents had apparently deemed it inapparopriate and our school librarian had made the decision not to carry it in the school's library	1
5338	3266	I was devastated, there would be no way my mother would agree to buy me all twenty some odd books that @PERSON1 had written and I didn't have enough money from my meager allowance and various lemonade stands to purchase them myself	2
5339	3266	Back then, this censorship which banned my favorite books from ever showing their covers in our school's library, bothered me immensely	3
5340	3266	I couldn't understand why some people's parents @MONTH1 view some of the subject matter in her books as too mature for our age group	4
5341	3266	However, I am having a change of heart	5
5342	3266	Now I can understand why our school's library @MONTH1 not be so fond of carrying books with racy aspects to them	6
5343	3266	That is why I believe that in school libraries, some books should be censored or marked mature	7
5344	3266	In public libraries though, these books should not be censored	8
5345	3266	Books need to be censored in school libraries because some children @MONTH1 be too immature to handle the subject matter within the book's pages	9
5346	3266	Most parents want their children to stay as innocent as possible for as long as possible and I can respect this idea	10
5347	3266	Having advanced books would also make the school look bad as not all parents would be on board with the idea and some would complain about their children reading something which they didn't intend them to find out about for many years to come	11
5348	3266	Not all censorship has to do with sex	12
5349	3266	Another type of graphic novel which is often censored is the violent type	13
5350	3266	The real-time war story which depicts the horrors of fighting for one's country and juxtaposes is with the thought that was is valiant and something to be applauded in the people back home	14
5351	3266	Some of these stories can get very graphic as to convey the point that war is not all fine and dandy and all it seems cracked up to be	15
5352	3266	These type of stories are important for our culture to prevent any misconceptions we @MONTH1 have or try to prevent them from a young age by shocking the reader	16
5353	3266	War should not be perceived as something fun and exciting and young @CAPS1 should know that so when they reach the age of signing up for the military they don't go into it misguided	17
5354	3266	In these instances, these violent stories are important for our youth to see and I think that they should not be censored in the library	18
5355	3266	One @MONTH1 raise the question of these books possibly invoking violence	19
5356	3266	I am not advocating that books with unecessary violence be put on the shelves	20
5357	3266	I believe that the books with violence which helps to convey and important point which should not be missed should be displayed by school libraries	21
5358	3266	Public libraries are a far different story	22
5359	3266	They have different sections for children's literature and adult literature	23
5360	3266	In school libraries the majority if not all of the library is devoted to children or teenagers	24
5361	3266	While in the public library it is the exact opposite, (unless the case in a children's public library)	25
5362	3266	Most public libraries carry mostly adult books and a small section of children's books	26
5363	3266	In this type of setting it would be fine to allow any type of book in the adult section, marked mature	27
5364	3266	The subject matter doesn't really matter but the point of public libraries is to educate our citizens and if what they want to read is violent or sexually explicit then so be it, as long as they are reading at all and using the government funded resources provided for them	28
5365	3266	If the library was privately owned then the owner could decide to put whatever books they wanted into it and censor whatever books they wanted to	29
5366	3266	The purpose of libraries is to educate the citizens of this country and try to better them and help them make clear informed decisions based on their prior knowledge	30
5367	3266	If the books are censored then some messages might not get conveyed and misinformation @MONTH1 run adrift	31
5368	3266	We must prevent this at any way possible	32
5369	3267	In my opinion, they should not censor books	0
5370	3267	They should be read the way that the author intended for @CAPS4 to be read	1
5371	3267	I understand censoring songs and movies, though, so that they @MONTH1 be played on the radio and in the theaters	2
5372	3267	The books that are contraversial right now have great messages, and should not be taken off the shelves because everyone should read them	3
5373	3267	They were written with this language because @CAPS4's the way people talked back then	4
5374	3267	These books are classics and should not be changed, or removed from the shelves	5
5375	3267	In the book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1, they use a lot of bad language, but this is how they talked back then and the author is trying to convey a great message to the readers	6
5376	3267	@CAPS4 should not be changed     @CAPS4 is understandable that they would change songs and take out the bad language so that they can be played on the radio	7
5377	3267	When an artist writes a song, they know that @CAPS4 won't be able to be played on the radio if @CAPS4 has bad or graphic language	8
5378	3267	I don't think they mind changing a few words of their song so @CAPS4 can be played on the radio for all to hear	9
5379	3267	The song '@CAPS5 You' by @ORGANIZATION1, they replaced the @CAPS6 word with '@CAPS5'	10
5380	3267	When he wrote this song, he knew that @CAPS4 wouldn't be able to play on the radio, so he changed a word, and @CAPS4 is still a good song	11
5381	3267	Movies are about the same as songs, they can't show a movie in theaters if @CAPS4 is too graphic	12
5382	3267	They @MONTH1 take out certain scenes, or change a few words, but that doesn't change the movie	13
5383	3267	Those scenes or words can be put back in the movie once @CAPS4 is sold in stores	14
5384	3267	I undertand and respect everyones opinion on this matter, I am just voicing mine	15
5385	3267	If these authors, or artists, wanted their work to be different, they would've made @CAPS4 so.	16
5386	3268	Books are books, and as well as magazines, music, movies, etc., therefore one purpose only right	0
5387	3268	To read them well thats what I thought	1
5388	3268	Even though books, magazines and even some movies might offend some people, that doesn't mean they should be tooken off the shelf	2
5389	3268	I think they shouldn't be tooken off the shelves	3
5390	3268	Beacuse if someone just like you wrote it, someone like you will probably be even more willing to read it	4
5391	3268	Though sometimes the books and magazines are inappropriate and @MONTH1 offend some people, doesn't mean they should remove them entirely because sometimes people need to read things there not completely comfortable with	5
5392	3268	Because reading about things that you don't know about entirely sometimes helps you learn not to do those bad things	6
5393	3268	It also helps prevent some kids to not smoke and do drugs if they hear or look at those things from experience	7
5394	3268	Books and magazines that offend people are only telling them what they don't want to hear	8
5395	3268	Even though you @MONTH1 not want to hear about it, drugs and sexual content are always going to be in the surroundings of our children to see or experience	9
5396	3268	Putting a book or a magazine about drugs in libraries are not going to make kids or people try drugs	10
5397	3268	Its the people that can't control themselves when they get around it or see it or even hear about it	11
5398	3268	It's called self control and some people have it some people don't	12
5399	3268	Reading a book about drugs will only prevent things like that from happening	13
5400	3268	So I think libraries should just leave the books on the shelves	14
5401	3268	If some people don't want to see it in their local libraries then they don't need to pick up the book, magazine or watch the movie	15
5402	3268	These books and magazines and movies only help us become stronger people	16
5403	3268	They also help us as a community to try and stay clean	17
5404	3268	These books are very important to the community to read so they don't ever get the tendency of doing those bad things	18
5405	3268	This is why I think books that offend some people should't be removed from the libraries	19
5406	3268	The libraries itself just need to move the books and magazines to another section of the library if they don't want to see or accidentally read about something that could possibly offend them	20
5407	3268	This could help the people avoid such things	21
5408	3268	Libraries just need to keep the books and magazines and movies on the shelf	22
5409	3268	Just as they are today in our local library	23
5410	3269	Typically when you walk in to a library there are books, magazines, movies, and cds everywhere	0
5411	3269	Most of the items in the library are appropriate for children, but some are for adults and teenagers	1
5412	3269	Many people struggle with the fact that there are items in the library that are offensive to religion, have offensive language in them, or contain adult materials	2
5413	3269	In this country we have a freedom of speech and a freedom of religion which allows us to choose things that we feel are correct in certain situations such as this one	3
5414	3269	True, there are books out there that are very offensive to certain types and religions of different people	4
5415	3269	Have you ever seen or heard of a movie that was educational yet offensive	5
5416	3269	In my opinon people should have the right to censor what the library provides for their student or child, to a certain extent	6
5417	3269	If a book or magazine or whatever it @MONTH1 be is offensive to someone, I believe that they should be able to choose if their student or child gets to look at that certain item	7
5418	3269	People should not take this censorship ability out of hand	8
5419	3269	I believe that our generation is much different from ones in the past because most of the things we have to deal with are things that are most likely offensive to a certain religion and or type of person	9
5420	3269	Which in a sense is hurting the censorship of all the people who choose to take part in it	10
5421	3269	I believe that a person or authority figure at the moment should be able to take a book off the shelf if and only if they request it to the library and they approve of it	11
5422	3269	People have the right to do what they choose, but taking away other peoples chances to read a book, or check out a movie is going a little far with that censorship privalige	12
5423	3269	I think that when a person feels that an item in the library is offensive they should have to sign a piece of paper stating why they think it should be taken out of the library and the people you believe it is offensive towards	13
5424	3269	In doing so i believe that only that certain item should be taken away from that certain group of people	14
5425	3269	All in all i believe that the censorship in libraries is a spectacular idea because of all the bad things in the world that come out in books, movies, and cds	15
5426	3269	People have the right to change things if they believe they are wrong	16
5427	3269	They should jump at the chance if it comes to a point where they can change things for the better	17
5428	3269	Do you believe that censorship in libraries is a good idea	18
5429	3269	I do, because it gives people to oportunity to change and make things better for themselves if they believe something is offensive.	19
5430	3270	I think that censorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere	0
5431	3270	If you do not like something said or seen in some of the materials, then do not read or watch or listen to any of them	1
5432	3270	People have different tastes in what they like to listen to or watch or read about	2
5433	3270	Some people might like rap music but other might like rock music	3
5434	3270	People that like rock music might not like rap because of some of the languauge used in songs	4
5435	3270	This is why some people listen to other types of music and do not listen to the type of music that they find offensive	5
5436	3270	I like rock and metal music just because rap is a little offensive	6
5437	3270	I have had a lot of family members say that i shouldnt be listening to such music because of the language	7
5438	3270	Some people say that reading certain things is a prefferance, but what if you are sitting in a doctors' office and you would like to read a magazine that is just sitting around	8
5439	3270	If you start going through the magazine and find something you do not like or take offense to, either keep flipping the pages or put the magazine down	9
5440	3270	You have to think to yourself that there are other people that enjoy or are interested in something you might find offensive	10
5441	3270	The best thing you can do is put it down and think to yourself that it is not directed towards you	11
5442	3270	Magazines can have all sorts of stuff hidden beyond the pages, but sometimes you have to look at the cover to see what some of the things that are written in the magazine	12
5443	3270	Sometimes this can help you decide on rather or not to read it	13
5444	3270	Movies are always fun to watch no matter what occation	14
5445	3270	Some people like certain movies such as action, comedy, romance, or drama	15
5446	3270	Some people might not like action due to the fact that there is violence in almost all of those movies	16
5447	3270	Some might not like comedy because of some of the rude humor	17
5448	3270	There are just alot of types of movies out there and its not the producers fault that we do not like it	18
5449	3270	People make different movies because everyone is not alike	19
5450	3270	Some people might get offended by some of the contents of a movie and what you could do to help that is just by reading into the movies before seeing them	20
5451	3270	I think that cencorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere.	21
5452	3271	Censorship of books     Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	0
5453	3271	Yes because certain things need to be removed from the shelves for example many things that don't need to be seen out in public	1
5454	3271	Personaly I think censoring certain things is alright because there are certain books that shouldn't be seen, music that has either swearing talking about drugs or other things, movies that kids shouldn't see like the rated '@CAPS1' or '@NUM1' that has either blood or nudity or somethen on that line, and magazines now magazines there are many types of magazines like for example adult, children, cooking, cleaning, house things, stuff for dogs or cats, and outside stuff	2
5455	3271	But censoring things that could be 'offensive' I can't understand how books can be offensive because some books are talking about history or something that has happen to them	3
5456	3271	Like for example lets just say a colored kid comes in and reads a book on '@CAPS2 slavery' that kid right there is going to get offensive about it and then that kid is going to say 'You owe me something because my anscetores were slaves' no your very wrong there kid because you either read the book wrong or you just didn't understand it	4
5457	3271	I have done that a couple of times either I got offensive about it and started getting very angry about it or just tose it in the trash because I got mad because I got offensive about it	5
5458	3271	Don't get me wrong I love reading but like I said before certain things are just ment to never be read or just never be found	6
5459	3271	But as for me getting offensive about a couple of books, movies, music, or magazines @CAPS13 I don't read magazines so I can't get offensive about that but books, movies, and music I take very offesively because like if I read lets just say the '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' and then I watch the movies @CAPS13 I take it offensively because nothing didn't tie in with the books or that person didn't direct it right	7
5460	3271	For books like I said I love reading books don't get me wrong but I do take very offensively because like something the character did or something that I wished I shouldn't have done something like that or a character dies and it reminds me of a close friend of mine or a teacher something on that line I either cry or I just stop reading the book period	8
5461	3271	Music now I could go all day on that because for example I used to love rap with a passion but now rap is just becoming horrible because the rapper is either talking about killing someone, drugs, or 'sex' it's like I said 'horrible' thats one thing that needs to go away for a long long time	9
5462	3271	But there are many other types besides rap	10
5463	3271	There is @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7 @CAPS8, punk, @CAPS1&@CAPS10, etc like I said I could go all day on music	11
5464	3271	The people who are censoring things like t.v	12
5465	3271	shows like for example @CAPS11 @CAPS12 seriously there is nothing wrong with that show some people are censoring that because adults think it is bad @CAPS13 people there is nothing bad with that show	13
5466	3271	I have been watching it since I was five years old and there was nothing bad on it then, then why would there be something bad on it now	14
5467	3271	All there is, is a grown man acting like a child it's like your going to tell your husband or your wife or your kids '@CAPS13 @CAPS14 I'm sorry but I have to censore you because your a bad person.'      I'm not saying that I would censore it I'm just saying maybe we as people should just take the time to look through some of these shows before censoring them	15
5468	3271	@PERSON1	16
5469	3273	I for one like books, movies, music, ect., without censoring	0
5470	3273	Sheltering the younge is not too bright because they'll get curious of things and sometimes they dont tell us they just find out for themselves	1
5471	3273	Most media and books have things uncensored for many different reasons and I think its going good	2
5472	3273	Yes there are some youth that take somethings too seriously but thats because the parents are not there to explain	3
5473	3273	I'm not saying go and show a four year old a rated '@CAPS1' movie but lighten up on somethings	4
5474	3273	Music is everywhere it's kind of hard to shelter your kid from music anyways because it's, well everywhere	5
5475	3273	You should be there to watch what there listening to but they're going to hear it sooner or later, might as well let them hear it around you then some one else that will give them the wrong advice	6
5476	3273	Some parents complain so much about this subject because they don't want to have to be there all the time to explain everything, but then why have a kid if you can't take that responsibility	7
5477	3273	Books are not so different, if a book has certain things that parents dont want their children reading then take it away from them	8
5478	3273	But most books with that kind of stuff don't have any pictures so they would have to imagine it and if they don't know what is being talked about then they wont be able to think of anything bad anyways	9
5479	3273	I'm not going to be a careless parent but I don't think sheltering kids from the real world and media and books is a good idea, very unwise	10
5480	3273	Kids are going to learn about curse words, drinking, and stuff like drugs someday, it's up to the parents to be there and teach the kid from right and wrong if they have a question from something they heard or watched or read	11
5481	3273	People worry too much about censoring and making sure everything is clean but media and books are not all clean, never has been 'till some people got lazy and didn't want to be there for their child @PERCENT1	12
5482	3273	When I was young my parents didn't shelter me or keep me from reading what I wanted to read, and I turned out fine	13
5483	3273	I don't drink or do drugs, because my parents were there if I had a question about something I didn't understand in a book or media	14
5484	3273	It's not the media or literature it's the parents, and if they can't be there to explain then why did they become parents	15
5485	3273	And as for magazines, if a parent is really that worried about certain ones around their children then don't let them buy them it's your choice	16
5486	3273	Don't you want your kid to get out there and live their own life when they become an adult	17
5487	3273	Then don't shelter them from everything	18
5488	3273	Let them find out about stuff when they ask a question	19
5489	3273	If they read something in a book and don't understand it then either you could tell them whether it's right or wrong or let them find out the bad way, that's your choice	20
5490	3273	If they see something on @CAPS2 then explain don't just freak out and block them from knowing what's out there in the real world	21
5491	3273	It's your choice to make on all that, but if you shelter them too long they'll never have a good life	22
5492	3273	Sheltering @MONTH1 not seem so bad now but wait 'till they get older and start they're lives, they wont know what to do or how to talk to people right	23
5493	3273	I've seen it with my own eyes on how bad sheltering kids from media and books can take effect on certain things in a human being's life	24
5494	3273	Censoring everything isn't good, the only way to learn anymore these days about real life is media and books	25
5495	3273	Not cesoring all that will help people see what the world needs to work on	26
5496	3273	So don't censor everything and let the next generation know what the generation before did wrong.	27
5497	3274	In our world today, there is a way to find anything that you could ever want under one roof	0
5498	3274	People call these buildings libraries	1
5499	3274	Libraries hold almost every book ever writen and offer them to the public free of charge	2
5500	3274	If you can not find what you are looking for in a book, they also have many other resources: movies, music, magazines, and the internet	3
5501	3274	I am not here to say that we should band any materials that are offensives because everything is offensive to somebody	4
5502	3274	There is always somebody out in the world that would say they are offened just to make a point or to get attention in our world today even if they did not even care about the subject at hand	5
5503	3274	The internet can take you to just about any thing that you would ever want to go to	6
5504	3274	Yes, the libraries do have blocks on the internet for websites that are very outragously offensive, but people have learned how to get around the blocks	7
5505	3274	Libraries are set up to where all the kids materials is in one location, all the teenage stuff is in another spot, and all the adult materials are in another room	8
5506	3274	As a young child, I liked going to  libraries and having fun and reading, but the one thing I never did was go to the adult room and I think many other other kids feel the same way	9
5507	3274	In fact, I have never seen a child in the adult section of a library	10
5508	3274	Movies and music have ratings and if the rating is over what the child should be watching, then the child can not check the movie or music without a parent's signiture	11
5509	3274	This ensures that kids can not check out bad or offensive materials without parental consent	12
5510	3274	Our libraries are set up just fine the way they are and I feel we should not try to change the libraries in any way	13
5511	3274	Movies and music have rating and kids can not check out offensive materials	14
5512	3274	The materials in a library are organized by age group and kids usually do not venture out of the area of their interest	15
5513	3274	Last but not least, if we took out everything in libraries that are offensive, then we would know longer have libraries in our communities.	16
5514	3275	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Newspaper, or to whom this article @MONTH1 concern	0
5515	3275	It has become quite aware to me the problem we face in our media today	1
5516	3275	Information and how individuals seek it has evolved and is still changing at a rapid pace	2
5517	3275	Technology and new information is so vast its extremely difficult to censor	3
5518	3275	Two weeks ago i took my @NUM1 year old niece @CAPS3 to our local public library to find her a book	4
5519	3275	Once the automatic  doors to the library opened she darted straight to the movie section	5
5520	3275	I couldnt help but laugh, because I knew thats why she truly wanted to go to the library	6
5521	3275	When i asked @CAPS3 what movie she was looking at, she turned the cover over with no reservation and, said' @CAPS5 @CAPS6'	7
5522	3275	'I can't let my young niece watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6', I thought silently to myself	8
5523	3275	Then i realized how easy it is for a child to access adult information	9
5524	3275	I agree with the statement of @PERSON1 in some degree	10
5525	3275	I believe if we started taking certian information away completly we would find ourselves ignorant	11
5526	3275	But when we let  our children ,the future of the world, vonerable to adult information they are greatly effected, @CAPS9 teens and violent video games, or explicit magazines	12
5527	3275	For example my niece is able to check out any book in the library, books like @CAPS10 @CAPS11 famous book intitled '@CAPS12 @CAPS13 ', which means my struggle in german	13
5528	3275	My @NUM1 year old niece can read quite well and is very impressionable as are many young children	14
5529	3275	Public media outlets need to be more heavily monitored, this includes public libraries, retail stores, the internet, and @CAPS14	15
5530	3275	I believe books should be censored by content much like movies	16
5531	3275	This makes the distibutor left responsible and the consumer more aware of the content and its effect	17
5532	3276	That saying Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I disagree with that statement	0
5533	3276	I think it is the goverment's choice if these items should be taken out of libraries or not	1
5534	3276	So we will need ligitement reason's to take some books off the shelf	2
5535	3276	Some people think we should take books off the shelf that teach the kid's our history	3
5536	3276	People don't have that right to take away from children	4
5537	3276	In the statement Katherine made, she is supporting that very idea	5
5538	3276	taking away our kids right to learn US history	6
5539	3276	The kids have that right to learn our very own history and some people want to take that away	7
5540	3276	Then what will our future generation be like	8
5541	3276	Some kid's might not even know who @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is or how we got here to this very continent	9
5542	3276	Parents also don't want us to read anything in books that have foul language or anything to do with nudity	10
5543	3276	I see what theese parents are trying to do	11
5544	3276	They are trying to protect their children, but the fact is people are going to have to go through this in life and if they arn't introduced at a younger age what will they do when they are older	12
5545	3276	Some kids that have that right taken away from will have no idea what to do when they get older and the foul language in the texts of theese books put voice into the books	13
5546	3276	We don't want the up coming generations to be blind to all of this because it is the real world	14
5547	3276	When I was was in fifth grade I liked to read alot	15
5548	3276	I really liked the adventure books such a the boxcar children and books like that	16
5549	3276	One time I went into the library and I picked out a book about a haunted house	17
5550	3276	The librarian would not let me check the book out because there were some texts in the book not apropriate for me	18
5551	3276	That sort of crushed my reading spirit and I really never wanted to go and check out a book by myself any more	19
5552	3276	So adults that want to take theese books of the shelves you might be stopping our generation from learning and if we don't learn then our next generation isn't going to want to read anything or learn	20
5553	3276	Theese are just a couple of reason we should not take books, magazines, movies, and music away from us	21
5554	3276	There are more people out there that have reasons to, so if you want to take this right away from us then be prepared for an argument because will fight for this right	22
5555	3276	So you adults who want to take that book off the shelf, you better have real good ligitement reason to take it off.	23
5556	3277	Censorship is a tricky concept	0
5557	3277	It is a word that can ban music from stores, books from shelves, and movies from theaters	1
5558	3277	Katherine Paterson, an author, said that if all things reading or listening materials were removed, nothing would be left	2
5559	3277	I thoroughly agree with that statement	3
5560	3277	If someone finds one aspect of a work offensive, that does not qualify for the work to be banned or discarded	4
5561	3277	I believe offensive material should not be removed because of the following reasons: it suppresses the feelings of the author, nothing will be left on the shelves, and there is no defining line on what is or is not offensive	5
5562	3277	Now, I understand there is a vast amount of people who are against my position	6
5563	3277	I assure them that I understand those feelings	7
5564	3277	Some audiences feel that the removal of offensive material is good because it shields the ears of those who cannot handle the verbage or context	8
5565	3277	Others @MONTH1 feel that sensitive audiences @MONTH1 not be comfortable with the text	9
5566	3277	In addtion, many people believe that exposing people to violent, risky, and material with dangerous habits will evoke the same behavior in young children	10
5567	3277	Though these are all valid opinions, they are not enough to automatically think that it is okay to throw it off the shelves	11
5568	3277	Contrary to the opinions of others, I believe one reason @CAPS6 material should be kept on the shelves because if it is not on the shelves, the the thoughts and feelings of the writer will be suppressed	12
5569	3277	For instance, the book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' was banned for a long time	13
5570	3277	Harper @CAPS3's book, @MONTH1 have had some slurs we @MONTH1 find offensive today	14
5571	3277	However, that is the way people in that time spoke	15
5572	3277	Who are we to fault the people of the @DATE1 and @DATE2 for how that articulate words	16
5573	3277	By banning 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' for the time frame that it was banned, generations were robbed of the powerful and beautiful meaning of the entire book	17
5574	3277	That meaning was that you cannot punish the innocent because they have done nothing wrong	18
5575	3277	The same for done for @CAPS6 book	19
5576	3277	@CAPS6 one reason why I believe that should stay on the shelves	20
5577	3277	Next, works of literature and music should stay on the shelves because as Katherine Paterson said if everyone removes a book, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS6 is very true	21
5578	3277	Many books have been on the banned book list	22
5579	3277	For instance there is 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2,' '@CAPS9 in the @CAPS10,' '@PERSON2,' and the like	23
5580	3277	What book will be removed from the shelves next	24
5581	3277	Once society is relieved of all literature, the next step will be music	25
5582	3277	Look at the singer/songwriter @PERSON3	26
5583	3277	He made some very sexually themed music	27
5584	3277	When people bought his records in the @DATE3, they had to be covered or placed in brown papered bags	28
5585	3277	They @MONTH1 be considered censorship, but that is one step away from being banned	29
5586	3277	His record company refused to produce his music under his name because of the scandalous lyrics	30
5587	3277	Because of that, @PERSON3 has changes his name to an unpronouncable symbol	31
5588	3277	What will be next	32
5589	3277	Finally, my last reason for why offensive material should not be removed is because who is to say whether or not something is offensive	33
5590	3277	A novel or song @MONTH1 be pleasing to @NUM1 people, but should it be extinguished from the record store or library because of one person	34
5591	3277	I do not think so	35
5592	3277	There are many words and concepts that have not be socially accepted of the centuries	36
5593	3277	However, those same appalling concepts have become accepted if not an uncommon habit	37
5594	3277	If @CAPS6 'offensive material' is given time, it will become unoffensive in the years to come	38
5595	3277	For all the reasons I have stated, I do not agree with removing anything off the shelves because something finds it to unacceptable if not offensive	39
5596	3277	If everything is removed because of an opinion, the world of the arts will be no more	40
5597	3277	Then, we as people will wonder what will be left of us	41
5598	3277	We will be nothing more than a mass of narrow-minded and ignorant individuals who know nothing about books, music, magazines, movies, etc	42
5599	3277	Now, I pose @CAPS6 question to you: If all was deemed offensive material, what would be left?	43
5600	3278	Everyone is different and unique in the world and they have their own unique opinions	0
5601	3278	Which brings us to the arguement of censorship on anything, because what some people find offensive others @MONTH1 not	1
5602	3278	The censorship that I am discussing  is specifically about censorship in libraries	2
5603	3278	There are three main reasons why libraries should not be censored	3
5604	3278	The first reason is the books were written so they could be viewed by the public	4
5605	3278	The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions	5
5606	3278	The final reason is parents can limit what their own children read	6
5607	3278	The censorship of libraries is an absurd idea, because a few people shouldn't make the choice for everyone	7
5608	3278	The first reason that libraries shouldn't be censored is the books were written so they would be read by the public	8
5609	3278	A library is a public place where people are supposed to get whatever books they choose	9
5610	3278	If a few people start censoring books then it will set off a chain reaction	10
5611	3278	After so many different books are censored there will be less books for peole to enjoy	11
5612	3278	All of the books that were censored were meant to be enjoyed	12
5613	3278	If books are censored some people @MONTH1 never even get a chance to see those books and they wont be able to learn from them	13
5614	3278	Books deserve the chance to be enjoyed like they were meant to be enjoyed and if they are censored that chance is gone	14
5615	3278	The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions	15
5616	3278	If someone doesn't like a book then they don't have to read it	16
5617	3278	They don't have the right to go censor that book, because they don't like it	17
5618	3278	Another person @MONTH1 enjoy that book and many others @MONTH1 like it as well	18
5619	3278	People should be able to choose what books they want and they shouldn't be told by others what they can and can't read	19
5620	3278	They need to let others make the decision when it comes to getting their books	20
5621	3278	People can't go around preventing other people from reading a book that they enjoyed	21
5622	3278	They need to let others think for themselves and let them read what they want to	22
5623	3278	The last reason is parents can limit what their children read.If the parents don't want their children reading something then they can tell their children that they aren't allowed to read it	23
5624	3278	Other people shouldn't be able to censor a book, because it is innapropiate for children	24
5625	3278	The child's parents can protect them if they find the book offensive for their children	25
5626	3278	Everyone needs to worry about what they like and let the other people enjoy what they want to	26
5627	3278	Let the parents set the limit for their children and it makes life simpler	27
5628	3278	Also it allows everyone else to enjoy the books if they aren't censored just for children	28
5629	3278	Parents will worry about their children and adults can worry about themselves	29
5630	3278	The censorship of libraries is absolutely wrong and it is also unjust	30
5631	3278	Somone shouldn't be able to say, 'I don't like this book so censor it.' I will remind you of the three reason why this is true	31
5632	3278	First the books were written so they would be enjoyed by the public	32
5633	3278	Also people people have the right to choose what they want	33
5634	3278	Finally parents can set limits on what their own children read	34
5635	3278	Books should be left uncensored so they can be enjoyed by whoever wants to read them	35
5636	3278	Everyone needs to let books be enjoyed by all and they shouldn't take away a books cahnce to be loved by censoring it.	36
5637	3279	Some people ask, '@CAPS1 books should be censored from libraries?' @CAPS2 are always parents who think that the libraries have books that are inappropriate for their kids, so they speak out against the library and tell them to censor or remove the books	0
5638	3279	I believe that in order for a library to censor or remove books, magazines, movies, music, etc., it depends on @CAPS1 the subject matter of those things are about	1
5639	3279	It's also the parent's job to monitor @CAPS1 their kids read, listen to, or watch	2
5640	3279	@CAPS2's no reason for a library to censor and take away books because one or two parents complain that it's inappropriate, when the parent can just pull their kids away from the book or movie and move on to something else	3
5641	3279	It's not the libraries job to watch kids and make sure they don't read, listen to, or watch anything bad	4
5642	3279	It's the parent's job	5
5643	3279	Katherine Paterson, an author, had a good point, also	6
5644	3279	She said that if she has the right to take books off the shelf, then so does everyone else	7
5645	3279	If everyone else starts taking books off the shelf, we have no books left	8
5646	3279	Everyone has a different view of books	9
5647	3279	@CAPS1 one person thinks is bad, another @MONTH1 not	10
5648	3279	It goes the other way, too: @CAPS1 one person thinks is good, another @MONTH1 think is bad	11
5649	3279	On the subject of movies, @CAPS2 are some that should be censored, like the movies containing extreme violence or gore	12
5650	3279	I remember going to the library when I was a kid, and I wanted to check out a @CAPS3 movie	13
5651	3279	I couldn't check it out because I wasn't at least @NUM1	14
5652	3279	I though it was ridiculous because it was only a @CAPS3 movie, and it was harmless	15
5653	3279	With magazines and music, it depends on the subject matter of those as well	16
5654	3279	Some magazines contain inappropriate pictures and articles for young kids, and it's those things that should be kept away from the kids	17
5655	3279	They don't neccessarily need to be censored or taken away, just kept in another section for teens and adults	18
5656	3279	The music poses a problem, though	19
5657	3279	A lot of the music these days can be very inappropriate, especially rap music	20
5658	3279	Music that sends negative messages and contains a lot of cursing in the lyrics should be censored, in my opinion	21
5659	3279	It doesn't belong in a library environment where young kids are roaming around and where they're influenced by it	22
5660	3279	In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines should or should not be censored or removed based on the subject	23
5661	3279	It just depends on @CAPS1 the subject is about and how inappropriate it is	24
5662	3279	@CAPS1 one parent thinks is bad, another @MONTH1 not	25
5663	3279	Overall, I think that books, music, movies, and magzines shouldn't be censored	26
5664	3279	Parents can just decide @CAPS1 they want their kid(s) to read, watch, or listen to	27
5665	3281	At a local library you can find hundreds of books, all of different matter, a different style and of different stories	0
5666	3281	Not every person enjoys the same type of topic to read about, not every person enjoys the same music style, nor does every person enjoy the same fashion in a magazine or the same articles written in the magazine	1
5667	3281	No one is the same, we all have different likes and interest	2
5668	3281	Some people @MONTH1 find certain books distrubing and inapporiate, that the book shouldnt be allowed to be on the shelves of libraries	3
5669	3281	That is only some people, what one person finds distrubing and gross another person can find interesting	4
5670	3281	Not one person is the same so not all books are going to be eye ctaching and interesting to every person	5
5671	3281	If one person finds a book to be inapporaite, yet another finds it interesting and suggest that book to their friends, is that one whom disagress upon the reading material as unexceptable to thier community allowed to take the book from the shelf, not allowing anyone else to read it	6
5672	3281	Everyone should be given the same oppertunity to read the book that another made find inapporaite	7
5673	3281	People should be allowed to read the material and topics they enjoy to read	8
5674	3281	But when it comes to a nude magazine, all about sex and being naked, that should be in adult stores only	9
5675	3281	A child in the library can wonder over to the adult side and pick up the magazine and see all those women, that mother doesnt want her child to be able to pick up and porn magazine or video when she takes the child to the library	10
5676	3281	You must be eighteen or older to view or buy those magazines, so only keep those magazine in adult stores where childern wont be able to view them	11
5677	3281	Now some books @MONTH1 have a naked picture in the text but it could be to show how to give a breast examination, to educate women about breast cancer and to help prevent seriousness over that matter, to well educate the people in our society about the matter	12
5678	3281	Books of diseases that @MONTH1 have nude photos should be allowed, they educate the communitry and save lives	13
5679	3281	Although not one persons voice or opinion should be heard over others, we were all created equal, we all should be heard	14
5680	3281	Books are as of the same way, they were all created equal for men, women, boys, and girls to be allowed to read and find adventure, excitment, sorrow and anger	15
5681	3281	We all have different hungrys for different reading, music and fashin	16
5682	3281	In this world today, in our society, and in our community there are different views upon what the children should be reading or should be allowed to pick off the shelf at their local library	17
5683	3281	Books were created by different people, who dont share the same views,who look upon life in a different way, whose voices arent all the same	18
5684	3281	The book has a curse word in the text, that doesnt mean the book is an abomination and will poison the community	19
5685	3281	That book could be one of the best books the child or adult has every read in their life	20
5686	3281	Everyone has different views, likes, interest, wants and needs	21
5687	3281	Not one person shares the same hunger of reading material	22
5688	3281	We should all be given the oppertunity to read or not read what another person finds inapporaite	23
5689	3281	The author as well deserves to be heard and not shunned out because some people view his or her material unexecptable for the shelves of their local library	24
5690	3281	Freedom of speech, freedom of happiness should be implyed with the pursuite to find a book that feeds the hunger of one person	25
5691	3281	Let every voice be heard, let every word be read, no matter how big, small, or how many imapporaite context is included.Let everyone read as they please and let everyone be marry in what they read	26
5692	3282	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3:     @CAPS4 I am @PERSON1 and I have heard there has been a discussion about different things in libraries	0
5693	3282	And I would like to let you know what I think about the whole situation	1
5694	3282	There are many things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc	2
5695	3282	that people believe aren't appropriate	3
5696	3282	Many people have differnt opinions then other people	4
5697	3282	Everyone had a differnt point of view and sees things differently	5
5698	3282	Ecspecially when it comes to what is appropriate for kids	6
5699	3282	I believe if a child comes home with a book, movies, etc	7
5700	3282	and their parent does not approve the parent should go and tell the librarian about why she thinks it isn't appropriate	8
5701	3282	The librarian should listen to the parent and then take a look at it for herself and see what she thinks about it	9
5702	3282	And if she finds it not approprite then she has the right to take it off the shelf	10
5703	3282	If the parent comes in and talks to the librarian about why something is not apropriate and the librarian believes it is alright then maybe she needs to just put the book, movie, etc	11
5704	3282	in a different area of the library	12
5705	3282	Like if a little kid finds a book and the parent says its inappropriate the librarian could take that book out of the little kid section, and maybe put it in a older kid area	13
5706	3282	I have actaully had an experience with this	14
5707	3282	At my old school adults were always complaining about books they didn't think were appropriate	15
5708	3282	When the librarian told us, we were upset because us girls loved to read those books	16
5709	3282	The librarian at the time thought they were appropriate and really didn't want to take them out of the library	17
5710	3282	So she had a great idea	18
5711	3282	She took those books, the ones people were complaining about, and put them on their own special shelf behind her desk	19
5712	3282	If you wanted one of those books you had to talk to your parent or bring a note in saying that you were allowed to read the book	20
5713	3282	It was a really good idea, because if your parent wouldn't allow you to read them you weren't tempted to get one, and wouldnt even see them	21
5714	3282	And the people who were allowed and wanted to read them still could with no problem at all	22
5715	3282	Another idea I have is if you see a younger kid by older people books, movies, etc	23
5716	3282	go talk to them about why they are over there and, tell them that, that's not their age level material	24
5717	3282	Try to direct them over to their age level area, and try to find them a book, movie, etc they @MONTH1 be interested in	25
5718	3282	I believe that everyone has different opinions but just because one person complains it doesn't mean it has to ruin it for everyone	26
5719	3282	Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean everyone else does too	27
5720	3282	I think censorship should somewhat be in libraries, but not to the extreme	28
5721	3282	There should be many different topics in libraries so everyone enjoyes the stuff there	29
5722	3282	There should be action,adventure, humor, love, etc	30
5723	3282	Talk to people and see what they like	31
5724	3282	And just because one person complains, dont take it out right away because to another person they might love it	32
5725	3282	Thank you for taking your time to read my opinion, and I hope I helped	33
5726	3283	i think that the libraries in generally shouldn't take themusic,movies, or the magazines away	0
5727	3283	Because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get   away and relax the self at the library to read	1
5728	3283	I think that they shouldn't take the books off the the shelves just for a reason because people love going to the library.And if they don't have those things then what the point of going there.my other thing that they shouldn't take those things away is thatthey will not make a profit	2
5729	3283	when the people go to the libraryand they dont see those things they are going to wonder want happen.i think that it shouldn't be the children fault that all of the books are gone	3
5730	3283	It should be the owners and the people that work at the library fault that they made them take the booksoff the shelves.I also think that when the children goes to the library they are going to ask there parent or someone.Where are the book because they want to read and also where are the book so they can check them out.But the people would want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out.I think that the people should not take the books off the shelves for a specific reason and that reason is that people and children would go like on a weekend to read if they dont have any of those things at home.My thing is that they shouldn't just remove anything at all because it going to be a big commotion	4
5731	3283	So  by removing all of  that would be sad because what if no one has no place to go and they are feeling loney and they want to go the library and read	5
5732	3283	but my whole point agbout it is that who came up with no books,music or magzines on the shelves.But i also think that if they did that in the real world	6
5733	3283	Then it would be terrible and a crisis to the people.I think that they should not do that because the people love to read listen to music and etc	7
5734	3283	I also think that they should not do that because people love going to to releave some stress that they might have and they jus want to go there.I also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love there jobs to not to.One of the things that i like is that when i go to the library it is nice and quiet and we can listen to our ipod or our @NUM1 player something like that.Some people just love to go so that they can see there friends and communicate with them to get on the computer	8
5735	3283	My reason is that they shouldn't do that is they can lose everything like there jobs and etc.	9
5736	3284	Are you offended when you read a book and your eyes cross over a swear word	0
5737	3284	Does it bother you to hear them with your own ears	1
5738	3284	No matter how hard you try, you can not avoid the harsh language of today's society	2
5739	3284	Have you ever walked into your library and started reading a book but decided to put it back on the shelf because of the language in the book	3
5740	3284	Many books in today's libraries have offensive language	4
5741	3284	Sometimes it gives the book character and makes the story more real to the reader, but in other cases the reader @MONTH1 be offended	5
5742	3284	In my personal view, if you do not like the language of the book, put it back on the shelf	6
5743	3284	The author wrote the book the way he or she wanted it to be written, not the way you would like to see it	7
5744	3284	Some material @MONTH1 be inappropriate for younger readers	8
5745	3284	The maturaty level of the reader definitely makes a difference when discussing censorship	9
5746	3284	For example, I am sure many parents have a problem with the movie 'The @CAPS1' for its use of alcohol and drugs	10
5747	3284	Many people find this movie funny and entertaining	11
5748	3284	Should this movie be taken of the shelves because it does use alcohol and drugs	12
5749	3284	These words and actions we try to censor are not going away	13
5750	3284	We see and hear them in everyday life, no matter where you @MONTH1 be	14
5751	3284	So if you don't like the language in the book, choose a different one	15
5752	3285	I think that if certain materials are offensive that they should be taken off the shelf, depending on how they are offensive	0
5753	3285	If they are offensive by rachism or being prejudice i think they shouldnt be on the shelfs	1
5754	3285	Also if it is offensive to women or men then it should be taken off of the shelfs	2
5755	3285	People should be able to read and listen to stuff without being offended by it	3
5756	3285	I think that if it is offensive to different races then yes it should be taken off the shelfs	4
5757	3285	I think this because, children can read this and then, they would beleieve that it is right to be races against other races	5
5758	3285	I think that children and other people should be able to read and listen to stuff without it offending others	6
5759	3285	Also they should be able to do this and not learn how to be offensive to others	7
5760	3285	People reading these things that are offensive could cause problems with others	8
5761	3285	It could cause problems for the libraies also, doing this by people not wanting to come back due to the fact of they have offensive material	9
5762	3285	Then with people not wanting to be there then the libraies wont have enough service and they will have to close	10
5763	3285	I also believe that if the masterial is offensive to women/men then it should be taken off the shelf	11
5764	3285	The magazines that have women and men in them can be offensive, because  alot of people look at them like they are trash	12
5765	3285	It makes a bad impression on some people	13
5766	3285	Its rude for it to be there	14
5767	3285	It puts not very good thoughts in some peoples heads	15
5768	3285	I believe that if material being read of listened to is offensive then it should be taken off the shelf	16
5769	3285	It can cause many problems with others	17
5770	3285	It could cause us to lose libraies if others choose not to go anymore	18
5771	3285	Things should not be left around if they are offensivce in any way.	19
5772	3286	There are people out there that think somethings should be taken off the shelves or not even made	0
5773	3286	But thats their decision and not everyone should listen to it or just try to do it	1
5774	3286	I think things that are offensive should and shouldn't be taken off	2
5775	3286	They should because it might offend someone and it shouldn't beacuse then people can read or see it or even listen to it if its music and then know more about it and then they might not do the same things	3
5776	3286	So people do have a choice on what should be banned or not but they also have a choice on if they want to read it or not too	4
5777	3286	They might not want their kids to read it but their kids will still hear the same things somewhere else also	5
5778	3286	I think they shouldn't be taken off because no matter what they do or what they say, stuff will still be out there in the world that people think are offensive and you just cant stop all of it	6
5779	3286	I listen to a lot of music when I drive to school and most of it is rap music	7
5780	3286	Yes, most of it is ofensive to girls and stuff but thats just music, it doesn't mean its true or anything	8
5781	3286	People have the choice to not listen to it or not read about it	9
5782	3286	If they think it is offensive to them or to anyone else or just not like it, they have thr right to just avoid it and not look at it	10
5783	3286	People want to just change everything and make sure things are perfect and nothing bad is in the world	11
5784	3286	But no matter what you try to do, something bad will be out there waiting for you	12
5785	3286	You just got to know how to avoid it	13
5786	3286	Avoiding things that you don't like would be a lot easier then just taking all the time you have to to try to get something banned off of a shelf	14
5787	3286	You should keep it on the shelf for the people who want to actually read it or just want to read it to see what its all about	15
5788	3286	When I read or listen to something thats offensive and I don't like it	16
5789	3286	I will just turn it off or not read it anymore	17
5790	3286	Not try to get it banned because that takes to much time	18
5791	3286	People should just not worry about what is being said or written and try to get it banned becuase another book will be out again and it will be the same	19
5792	3286	So as you can see I think the material that is written should just stay as it is and people can have their choice on if they want to read it or not	20
5793	3286	If they do and they think its offensive then thats their fault for reading it when they know its gonna offend them	21
5794	3286	And for the people who don't read it, they are doing it because they know it will offend them	22
5795	3286	So not reading something that you don't like will be better in the end because then nothing will be banned and maybe nothing else will be made in the process of it being banned	23
5796	3286	So nothing should be banned and just keep it and everything will still be the same	24
5797	3286	We might not want our kids to read something bad but they will one day so why not just get it done and over with in the benginging.	25
5798	3287	Censorship in librarys could be useful so children and young people don't see what their parents don't want them to see	0
5799	3287	In the kids section, they have kid's books	1
5800	3287	In the adult section they have adult books	2
5801	3287	Those sections are there to keep children from reading or seeing things that @MONTH1 be what their parents don't want them seeing	3
5802	3287	But then again, a parent could bring their kids into those sections so they can find their books without leaving their child unattended	4
5803	3287	Completely taking books out of the library because they are offensive is not a good thing	5
5804	3287	It takes away certain literature that people might like reading	6
5805	3287	But then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight	7
5806	3287	I am a big reader so I have been to librarys many times but I never actually saw any material that was so bad I thought it needed to be taken out	8
5807	3287	If there was though, they should just make an alternative section for books, music, movies, and magazines that some people think should be put there	9
5808	3287	For example, some albums that contain offensive language or topics have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3' stickers on them	10
5809	3287	It's simple enough to see these stickers so that you can put it in the alternative section of a library	11
5810	3287	People that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out	12
5811	3287	Books always have reviews, so people can tell if those are too @CAPS1 or not	13
5812	3287	The library staff could put those books in the alternative section	14
5813	3287	Movies always have ratings, so staff could put anything rated @CAPS4 or above on those shelves	15
5814	3287	Now I've never seen a bad magazine at a library before	16
5815	3287	I'm sure they would never have magazines such as '@CAPS5' or '@ORGANIZATION1' there	17
5816	3287	People wouldn't need to worry about magazines from my experience	18
5817	3287	That is my solution	19
5818	3287	Make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely	20
5819	3287	That takes away a lot of literature for the people that like that material	21
5820	3287	You couldn't take away movie classics like '@CAPS6' or '@CAPS7'	22
5821	3287	Those movies have been put on the highest of best film lists	23
5822	3287	Yes, they are rated @CAPS4 but no, that doesn't take away the fact that they are great movies	24
5823	3287	Don't take the material out	25
5824	3287	Just make a new section for it.	26
5825	3288	There are thousands of libraries throughout the world	0
5826	3288	All of which are filled with numberous books, magazines, music, movies, ect	1
5827	3288	for people of all ages to obtain	2
5828	3288	Some people think that materials in a library should be censored while others think everything should be allowed to be there	3
5829	3288	I do not think materials at a library should be removed, or censored, because the materials would decrease, people would choose what to look at, and the material would help with research	4
5830	3288	Materials at libraries should not be censored because the materials allowed at the libraries would decrease	5
5831	3288	Everyone has different opinions on what they think is appropiate or not	6
5832	3288	If one person were to decide a book was unappropiate and take it off the shelf, another person would have the right to take another book that they thought was unappropiate off the shelf as well	7
5833	3288	However, since everyone has different beliefs on what is appropiate and what is not, the books would rapidly decrease.The same would apply to the other items at the libraries such as magazines, movies, ect	8
5834	3288	Another reason is because everyone has their own choice about what they want to look at in a library	9
5835	3288	A fifty year old man would not have the same intrests as a thirteen year old girl, so if some materials were removed, there would not be as much of a variety to chose from	10
5836	3288	If there is a little variety to chose from due to materials being censored, the amount of people using the library would decrease causing the library to eventually get shut down from the lack of people using it	11
5837	3288	Lastly, materials at a library should not be censored because each and every item there could help with some kind of research	12
5838	3288	A child from high school could go to the library to look for a book to help research things for a report in one of their classes, or an elder women could go to the library in search of a cookbook to research something new to make for her next home cooked meal	13
5839	3288	Both people would need a material from the library to help them with their reasearch, but if some materials at the library were removed, they might not be able to find something to help them	14
5840	3288	Materials at a library should not be censored because the materials would decrease, people would choose what to look at, and the material would help with research	15
5841	3288	Some people believe removing items at a library should be allowed, but I strongly disagree	16
5842	3288	There are many different materials in the libraries around the world today for people of all ages to come in contact with, and that is the way it should stay	17
5843	3289	In my opinion i don't really think certain items should be romoved from the library	0
5844	3289	I think this because many people have different kinds of interests in many things they love doing	1
5845	3289	In my personal opinion I never remove anything from a library because I know their are alot of people with many interests	2
5846	3289	At the same time I do understand some of the items should be removed from the library, beacuse they could not appropriate for childrern	3
5847	3289	If we removed cerain items from the library people would get mad	4
5848	3289	I think no item should be removed from the library because many people are interested in many things	5
5849	3289	There are many ways we can arrange the library by sections so that certain books or topics are in one area, and others are in another area	6
5850	3289	We can aslo make sure that no under age kid can go to an adult area	7
5851	3289	If we don't remove nothing from the library we would have alot of people coming	8
5852	3289	In the other hand if we removed a certain type of books, people would get mad and not come to the library	9
5853	3289	If that happens smaller amounts of people will come	10
5854	3289	In my personal opinion no item should be removed from the library because many people  have many interesting in many topics in the library	11
5855	3289	If we remove a certain item from the library then we would loose a certain amount of people	12
5856	3289	Thats why we should not remove anything from the library to provent the decrease of people coming to the library	13
5857	3289	Like I said many people have many intersts in many things and they deservie to enjoy them in the library.	14
5858	3290	Books mean a lot to people that love to read	0
5859	3290	Books have pictures, or they @MONTH1 even be poem books	1
5860	3290	Some books should not be on the shelves in libraries	2
5861	3290	They have offesive language and not so well of pictures	3
5862	3290	They @MONTH1 be learning books but the little kids do not need to see that	4
5863	3290	I think books should be removed from the shevles if found offensive	5
5864	3290	Libraries need to up their standards of what should be in the library and what should not	6
5865	3290	The books, movies, music, ect	7
5866	3290	needs to be in a certain section of the library to where the little kids can not go or reach	8
5867	3290	A library is a family place not a fun zone for adults	9
5868	3290	On @DATE1, I went to the library with my brother to pick out a book for him	10
5869	3290	@CAPS2 is only six about to be seven	11
5870	3290	He had told me he wanted to get a book about dinosuars, but I told him to get one on space and aliens	12
5871	3290	@CAPS2 was very into reading	13
5872	3290	He  read to our mom everynight before he would go to bed	14
5873	3290	We were walking down @CAPS1 street when a bolt of lighting struck through the trees	15
5874	3290	'ekkkk!' said @CAPS2 as he ran around me	16
5875	3290	We walk into the library and the old lady at the front desk says, 'there is a huge storm coming.' We sorta ignore her and go on about our bussiness picking our books for @CAPS2	17
5876	3290	@CAPS2 and I walk up stairs to the childrens section	18
5877	3290	@CAPS2 is looking around and he says 'hey kayla, what is this and he picks up a naughty magaizine	19
5878	3290	i rush over to snach it out of his hands and he gets scared	20
5879	3290	He ask 'but sissy what is that?' I do not respond	21
5880	3290	I tell him to pick a book and come on	22
5881	3290	He grabs one and we are on our way to get it checked out and the lights go off	23
5882	3290	It was completely dark	24
5883	3290	'@CAPS3 stay calm.' a man says	25
5884	3290	The back up lights come on and we all go to the lobby area	26
5885	3290	We sit there for twenty mins and the lights are back on	27
5886	3290	Everything is normal again and we go to check out	28
5887	3290	We get up to the front and i turn in the bad magazine that @CAPS2 had found	29
5888	3290	The lady askd why I was bringing it to her and i had to tell her the bad news, that it was up in the childrens section	30
5889	3290	She said 'oh my!' @CAPS2 laid his books up on the counter and we checked out	31
5890	3290	We walked out the front doors and we were on our way home.	32
5891	3291	Should public libraries have to censor some of the books, movies, and music they have on display	0
5892	3291	In my opinion they shouldn't have to	1
5893	3291	We as people have the right to learn, read, and expand our minds in whatever way we see right for us	2
5894	3291	There are three main reasons as to why I feel 'offensive' pieces of writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries	3
5895	3291	One reason as to why they should not is that people have been writing and expressing themselves throughout history	4
5896	3291	therefor, there are far too many pieces that we would have to get rid of in order to eliminate them all	5
5897	3291	The second reason is that people have different opinions as to what is 'offensive' and what is not	6
5898	3291	The third reason that will be elaborated on is that people will be exposed to whatever it is you try to hide, if not throught the art of music, movies, or books, then through the real world we live in	7
5899	3291	Throughout history, man kind has been writing things down to document experiences, events, and ideas that have happend throughout history	8
5900	3291	With those expierences come profanity, sexuality, death, and abundant amounts of situations that the public eye might consider 'offensice'	9
5901	3291	If you were to try and delete these pieces, one you would be destroying a big part of history, and two there are far too many books, movies, and music pieces that you would have to get rid of	10
5902	3291	In almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative	11
5903	3291	If you were to take them out, you would be left with very few, if any books	12
5904	3291	The second reason is that poeple have different opinions on what is bad, and what is not	13
5905	3291	For example, I was going on a band trip with all the other band students, and on the way there we put on a movie	14
5906	3291	We ended up having to turn off the movie, because one parent found it inappropriate	15
5907	3291	While that parent didn't like it, other parents were upset we turned it off, because they saw nothing wrong with it	16
5908	3291	The same rules apply with books and music	17
5909	3291	It all depends on personal views as to it being 'offensive' or not	18
5910	3291	The third reason is that poeple will expierence all of the things you are trying to hide	19
5911	3291	If you take it out of the library, one will hear about it on the news, on the radio, in a restraunt, in schools, just about anywhere they are	20
5912	3291	Taking out the pieces in the library, will be useless in the long run	21
5913	3291	For example, people want to take out a book called, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' because it uses the word 'nigger' in the story quite a few times	22
5914	3291	There are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school	23
5915	3291	On top of that, they want to get rid of all the books that say 'nigger' and replace them with books that say 'slave' instead	24
5916	3291	In my opinion that would be a stupid thing to do, because it takes away the authentisity and effectiveness out of the book	25
5917	3291	In the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think	26
5918	3291	If you replace it with 'slave' that statement or passage loses its power on its readers	27
5919	3291	In conclusion, I strongly feel that libraries should not have to take out the 'offensive' books, music, or movies	28
5920	3291	If it does happen, we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge	29
5921	3291	With that if we do it, how will we know what books to take out, if everyone has a different opinion on what is 'offensive' and what is not	30
5922	3291	Finally, should we do this, it will not solve anything	31
5923	3291	People in today's society will still be mean, still do sexual things, people will still use harsh language, and people will still expierence 'offensive' actions	32
5924	3291	That is the society we live in and poeple will have to accept that fact	33
5925	3291	That is why I feel that we need to keep all of the 'offensive' pieces we have, that way the people reading them might be ready for the real world once it hits them.	34
5926	3292	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
5927	3292	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then so does everyone else	1
5928	3292	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine has a good view on the idea of censorship in libraries	2
5929	3292	Most books have ideas and topics that are offensive to one person or another	3
5930	3292	I believe that books that have something offensive in them should not be censored	4
5931	3292	An idea that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensice to the other, and vice versa	5
5932	3292	Someone who is pro life on the controversial issue of abortion @MONTH1 believe that a book about a teenage girl getting an abortion is offensive and against their beliefs	6
5933	3292	In truth, the author was just trying to convey how the teenage girl feels and what happens when you go through with something like that	7
5934	3292	Katherine Paterson said it well when she mentioned that no books would be left on the shelves	8
5935	3292	If every person felt threatened or was offended by just one book, libraries would have to close because no books would be left	9
5936	3292	Books on the topic of religion would definitely have to be censored as well because people of differing religions	10
5937	3292	The @CAPS1 @MONTH1 be offensive to someone of @CAPS2 religion, and because of that the @CAPS1 would not be able to be sold	11
5938	3292	If that happened there would be an ongoing battle about it	12
5939	3292	Books should not be censored because an idea that is offensive to one, @MONTH1 not be to another	13
5940	3292	If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall	14
5941	3292	When authors write books they are pouring their hearts out to us	15
5942	3292	If someone thinks their book is offensive and it gets censored, the author of the book would be even more offended	16
5943	3292	Their life's work could go into one book and just because a group of people do not like it, it gets taken off the shelves	17
5944	3292	I don't know about you but I would rather read a book with an interesting and maybe controversial topic than a book that seems to go nowhere	18
5945	3292	If censorship in libraries actually happened, many authors @MONTH1 say forget it and not even right anymore	19
5946	3292	It is very hard to write a book that pleases everyone	20
5947	3292	Also, attraction to literature would seize	21
5948	3292	People are not attracted to books that do not have a quality topic that gets them interested	22
5949	3292	Literature would have an immediate downfall if books were censored	23
5950	3292	If books were censored, the quality of learning would not be the same	24
5951	3292	Books are tools for learning and taking them away would be harmful to education	25
5952	3292	Some teenagers including me @MONTH1 find some of the material they read-even in school-to be offensive or have a touchy subject	26
5953	3292	I do admit that reading books for class is somewhat annoying at times, but it will help us in the future	27
5954	3292	These books have meaning, which is why they are picked by teachers for students to read	28
5955	3292	Something offensive like a cuss word is not going to keep someone from finding the meaning of the book	29
5956	3292	The quality of learning would not be the same if books were censored	30
5957	3292	A book can be offensive, yes, but one book is not going to ruin someone's life	31
5958	3292	An important thing to remember is that by taking a book off a shelf, or not playing music because of a few harmful words is like denying the creativity and compassion of an author or artist	32
5959	3292	One book that is offensive to one, @MONTH1 not be to another	33
5960	3292	If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall and the quality of learning would not be the same	34
5961	3292	For all of these reasons, censorship in libraries should not be allowed.	35
5962	3293	Recently the growing issue of censorship in libraries came to my attention	0
5963	3293	This is unfortunent in the extreme	1
5964	3293	People have a right to unmolested knowledge and censoring libraries is a direct violation of that right	2
5965	3293	Libraries are meant to be a place of learning and they should be kept that way	3
5966	3293	History is filled with moments both glorious and inglorious	4
5967	3293	We aren't always proud of want we do or what happens but those events remain, irrespective of whether or not we choose to acknowledge it	5
5968	3293	To think turning a blind eye to the less than clean will make it go away is not only unrealistic but also totally ignorent of facts	6
5969	3293	I realise that there are some things chilldren should not see or hear and I'm not suggesting we expose them to these things	7
5970	3293	I'm merely saying that trying to hide them from what we deem to be unclean is neither right nor a good idea in general	8
5971	3293	We can't shelter our children forever and sooner or latter they will learn things we wish they didn't	9
5972	3293	This is inevitable	10
5973	3293	Life doesn't seek to hide its darker side from us at all and to hide it from our children will serve little more than to handicap them	11
5974	3293	Do children need to be protected for some things	12
5975	3293	Yes, for a time, they do but it is the role of the induvidual parent to protect their child	13
5976	3293	Protect the children but don't do so at the expence of everyone else	14
5977	3293	Why should the views of some hinder all others	15
5978	3293	Those who would persume to know what people should see and what they should not are out of touch	16
5979	3293	Those prudish enough to believe that people need to be protected for natural, form history, or from their own desires have no more right, and preahaps even less than everyone else to interfere with induvidual decision making	17
5980	3293	People have a right to make their own choices on what them believe but no right to force those oppinions on others	18
5981	3293	This essay @MONTH1 make no difference but it has said what needed to be said and thus served it's purpose	19
5982	3293	With that task completed I can finnish with a good concious.	20
5983	3294	I believe that if you hear or read something offensive they should stay for many reasons	0
5984	3294	I feel everyone should know the history of the world, whch means rascitism or being offended	1
5985	3294	I feel if you are reading a book or listening to music and you hear something offensive to you , just turn it off	2
5986	3294	You aren't being force to listen or read it, its your choice	3
5987	3294	Libraries should keep the materials cause the people of the world should know how it feels to be offended	4
5988	3294	I certainly don't like the feeling of being offended, but its something people go through life with	5
5989	3294	There @MONTH1 be people out there that probably disargree's with me, its just my oponion	6
5990	3294	You @MONTH1 go to the certain libraries in the world that doesn't allow certain people in because of their oponions on the selection of materials the library offers	7
5991	3294	I once heard a woman at a library talking about how she went to the police about someone writing offensive things towards her religion on the internet @CAPS1 happen to the person but, its the fact that she went to the police	8
5992	3294	She could have handle the sitiutation herself, by just comforting the person about it	9
5993	3294	I feel that the mintue she started to read it, she should have turned away or got off the website	10
5994	3294	It was her decision to keep reading it	11
5995	3294	I don't see why she should go to the police, if it was just the person's oponion	12
5996	3294	Libraries should keep the materials cause maybe someone wants to know the meaning of being offensive or being offend	13
5997	3294	Libraries shouldn't have to hide this topic from anybody	14
5998	3294	People are offensive because they were rasied or just born that way	15
5999	3294	Some people just have to deal with these people	16
6000	3294	They might not like it or @MONTH1 do somethings towards them in there lifetime but, they have to live with them	17
6001	3294	In the end, either if they want to or not libraries should keep certain materials out even if they are offensive towards people	18
6002	3294	Libraries shouldn't just change there ways for certain people that don't like the materials	19
6003	3294	They are plenty people of the world that want to learn more on the topic	20
6004	3294	These people shouldn't be stopped by the ones who don't like the topic	21
6005	3294	Its just apart of life	22
6006	3295	Should certain materials such as books, magazines, movies, etc., be taken off the shelf in a library if those items @MONTH1 be offensive towards others	0
6007	3295	There are many possible answers to this question, but I believe that if someone does not like a certain book or finds it offensive they should not have the right to take it off the shelf	1
6008	3295	I believe that him/her should not be able to take it off the shelf because if that person finds it offensive, there are others who would not find it offensive	2
6009	3295	For example, @PERSON1 might want to read a book about abortion, but @CAPS1 is against and offended by that book or subject	3
6010	3295	If that book is taken off the shelf, it is restricting other people, such as @PERSON1, who would like to learn or read about that specific subject	4
6011	3295	Another reason why I think that certain books, magazines, music, or movies should not be taken off the shelf is because if one book is offensive to some people, then another book @MONTH1 be offensive to others as well	5
6012	3295	So, if there are people who find some books offensive, and are then taken away	6
6013	3295	there will be a little amount of books for the other students to read	7
6014	3295	Even though certain books @MONTH1 offend people, I think the book or magazine should not be removed from the library or shelf	8
6015	3295	I believe that if someone does not like a certain book, magazine, movie, music, ect., that person should not have the right for that book or any other material to be taken away	9
6016	3295	They should not be taken away because other people might want to read that book, and secondly, that would leave a lot less books for other people to read and learn information about.	10
6017	3296	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 ,           I dissagre with removing materials from the library	0
6018	3296	I personally do not think it is the libraries fault if someone is offened by books, movies , music or magazines etc	1
6019	3296	If they did not like the book or movie it is their fault for picking it in the first place	2
6020	3296	Children who are under the age of thirteen should not be able to watch movies that are not for them , they should not be seeing those bad movies or scary movies at such a young age	3
6021	3296	I  want the libraries to think this over 	4
6022	3296	because it is not fair to adults or older children	5
6023	3296	Movies that are funny entertain children daily 	6
6024	3296	some children even quote movies and make other children laugh	7
6025	3296	I know for a fact us teens watch funny movies to make our rough day turn into a better day , well that is what I do at least	8
6026	3296	There are some movies out there that are just so funny , I could quote ever line of it	9
6027	3296	Music on the other hand is very important to teens these days	10
6028	3296	It is always enjoyable to me	11
6029	3296	I love music without it I'm not quite sure where I would be in this world	12
6030	3296	I love many  different kinds of music , most of it is very fun to listen to	13
6031	3296	I'm not a big fan of rock , you would not see me picking that up from the library.Us teens love music , we use music for pretty much everything	14
6032	3296	We dance to it , sing to it , workout to it , and most of all we just enjoy it	15
6033	3296	Books are always important , even though I do not like to read that often I still like to read books that interest me	16
6034	3296	For example you would not see me reading a scary book , because it would just remind me of the movie , and I would have nightmares	17
6035	3296	The books that interest me the most are fiction books	18
6036	3296	My two favorite books are A @CAPS1 To @CAPS2, and The @CAPS3 @CAPS4	19
6037	3296	Both of those books are by the author @PERSON1	20
6038	3296	I love all of his books but these ones are the best	21
6039	3296	Please re think your decission about getting rid of the bad music , books , and  movies	22
6040	3296	@CAPS2 it is not the libraries fault it is the people who are borrowing them	23
6041	3296	If they do not like it then they should have never taken it home in the first place	24
6042	3296	I say we just let it be, and let people be happy	25
6043	3297	There are many books that are not appropriate for childeren or teenagers, though they can still check the books out in the library	0
6044	3297	They can take them home, read it, and discover some things that shouldn't be discovered at their age	1
6045	3297	Childeren check out rated @NUM1 movies and rated @CAPS1 movies and unedited @CAPS2's and they learn a lot of bad things or words that they should not use at the age their age	2
6046	3297	The libraries are supposed to make sure your @NUM2 years of age before you check out a rated @CAPS1 movie	3
6047	3297	Also you have to be a certain age to buy @CAPS2's and games that are for the elderly teenagers	4
6048	3297	You should have to be a certain age to check out or buy a movie or anything that has vulger language	5
6049	3297	Today kids aren't as mature as they used to be	6
6050	3297	Things today are way different	7
6051	3297	My opinion is that teenagers should have to be a certain age to rent or buy things that are bad but I have read some books that were not really all that great for my age either	8
6052	3297	I guess it is just how mature you are and ready to accept vulger things	9
6053	3297	It should have to be your parents decision to see if your ready or not	10
6054	3297	My final conclusion is that it depends on how mature you are and if you think your ready	11
6055	3297	The stores and libraries should set limits on books and ages	12
6056	3297	Although some people will not agree	13
6057	3297	There should be boundaries for teenagers and age privelages and they should respect them enough not to do them	14
6058	3298	Many people base their actions on their own views	0
6059	3298	What @MONTH1 appear to be justified in their minds, due to their beliefs, might cause an uproar from others	1
6060	3298	One instance of this: media censorship	2
6061	3298	It happens every day, every place	3
6062	3298	Someone can take it upon them selves to ,in their mind, 'make the piece better for @CAPS8 viewing'	4
6063	3298	In reality, though, they are really ruining the experience of the media for everyone else and even impeading on the rights granted to us by the constitiution: @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2	5
6064	3298	First up, books in the library	6
6065	3298	Everytime I go to the library and pick up some books, there is always one book with the 'bad parts' marked out	7
6066	3298	Someone had found these words offensive and decided that no one should have to see or read them	8
6067	3298	To me, it was irritating	9
6068	3298	I don't always like those words either, but having them marked out is distracting from the page and , for me, ruins the author's voice and style of writing, hence impairing what I draw from the book	10
6069	3298	Some marked-out words aren't always offensive to others, either	11
6070	3298	Simply put, if you find the book offensive, don't read it	12
6071	3298	Others @MONTH1 enjoy it, whether they share your views or @CAPS7	13
6072	3298	People also take the liberty of simply removing whole pieces of media from shelves just because they find it offensive	14
6073	3298	If everyone removed anything they didn't like, or found offensive, there would be nothing left in the world for anyone to enjoy	15
6074	3298	We, as @LOCATION1 citizens, have the right to make our own choices, and our choices should @CAPS7 be limited by the views of certain individuals	16
6075	3298	That means that if I want to read or view something, it should be available to me, so I @MONTH1 learn and expand my views, even if it makes someone else uncomfortable	17
6076	3298	With nearly every disputable form of media that comes out, people harangue the producers and say the piece should have never been made	18
6077	3298	Wrong	19
6078	3298	Producers and authors can publish whatever they would like	20
6079	3298	It's called @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2, and it is a right garunteed to us, as @CAPS5 citizens, under the @CAPS6	21
6080	3298	And learly, if pieces like that are being produced, people read it	22
6081	3298	Plain and simple	23
6082	3298	You might @CAPS7, but maybe a neighbor, or even a relative, @MONTH1 @CAPS7 be offended by it and might read it	24
6083	3298	Supply and demand	25
6084	3298	If everyone found it offensive, no one would buy or read it, and because of that, it would no longer be produced	26
6085	3298	You would get your way	27
6086	3298	But, no	28
6087	3298	Some people do read it and it is produced	29
6088	3298	Again, if you don't like it, don't read it	30
6089	3298	People should @CAPS7 take it upon themselves to censor what others can and can't do, see, or read	31
6090	3298	If someone wants to read a story that has 'bad words' in it, so be it	32
6091	3298	Others should @CAPS7 ruin the experience by marking the words out	33
6092	3298	@CAPS7 only is it rude and ruining the experience for the reader, but it is also destroying someone else's property	34
6093	3298	If someone wants to view something that is against a certain religion, so be it	35
6094	3298	They have the right and no one can take that right away from them	36
6095	3298	In my opinion, censorship in libraries, whether by government, or other civilians, should @CAPS7 be allowed	37
6096	3298	We citizens are allowed the right to make our own choices and in @CAPS8 libraries, the @CAPS8 should be allowed to read or watch whatever they want	38
6097	3298	Choice is one of the prinicples of the constitution, and it should be protected, @CAPS7 limited	39
6098	3299	Many libraries contain books, movies, music, and magazines that can be considered offensive	0
6099	3299	All of these libraries, however, have certain reasons to have these books	1
6100	3299	Whether those reasons are for education or for recreation, the libraries have reasons for them	2
6101	3299	So, the libraries that do have 'offensive' books, should be allowed to keep them because they are not offensive to everyone, and they could be beneficial to the reader	3
6102	3299	These books that are considered offensive to some people @MONTH1 not be offensive to others	4
6103	3299	For example, @PERSON2, who is from the @CAPS1, comes into a library and finds a book that is all about the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and she reads that the @CAPS1 is full of a bunch of people who mistreated their slaves	5
6104	3299	@PERSON2 gets a @CAPS5 offended by this	6
6105	3299	Then @CAPS5 @PERSON3, who is an @CAPS6 @CAPS7, picks up the same book and reads all about the @CAPS1 and how they treated their slaves	7
6106	3299	@CAPS5 @PERSON3 thinks that the same book that @PERSON2 hated is a great book	8
6107	3299	As shown in the example, @LOCATION2's people are very diverse, but what comes with that diversity is a lot of opposing views in its citizens	9
6108	3299	A library doesn't want to only appeal to one race, it wants to appeal to all of them, the only way to have that happen is to accidently offend some people in the process	10
6109	3299	The citizens of the @LOCATION1 need to be more understanding that their race isn't the only one here	11
6110	3299	If a book offends a person, that person simply should not read it	12
6111	3299	However, these books, who many @MONTH1 find offensive, could also be beneficial to its readers	13
6112	3299	Some of these books could be helpful to the people who choose to read it	14
6113	3299	Going back to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 reference, @PERSON2 was reading her @LOCATION3 @CAPS11 text book, and she read about the horrible deeds the @CAPS1 had done regarding their slaves and the fact that they lost the @CAPS3 to the @ORGANIZATION1, and she got offended because her side lost	15
6114	3299	Then @CAPS5 @PERSON4, who is in the same class as @PERSON2, was reading his history text book and was becoming more and more elated as he read on	16
6115	3299	He found out that kids all over the the country were learning about what had happened to his ancestors and that the @ORGANIZATION1 defeated the @CAPS1	17
6116	3299	@PERSON3 was as happy as he could be with this book, whereas @PERSON2 couldn't be any more displeased	18
6117	3299	If this book was pitched out of the library, how would students all over the nation learn of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3	19
6118	3299	They wouldn't	20
6119	3299	Libraries cannot just throw out books because they offend someone	21
6120	3299	As Katherine Paterson said, if we all picked a pile of books that offend us and got rid of them, then there wouldn't be any books left for any of us to read because other nations would be offended by the books that appealed to one, and so on and so forth	22
6121	3299	So, libraries need to keep the books that they have and get even more books	23
6122	3299	This nation needs as many books as it can get because they are all extremely helpful to those that they appeal to	24
6123	3299	We just need to remember that not all of the books appeal to us and not to get offended by those that don't.	25
6124	3300	Censorship in liraries, in my opinion is over-rated	0
6125	3300	Everywhere you hear of book, music, magazines, and movies being offensive or degrading, but does that mean that they should be taken off the shelves of our public libraries, or out of book stores	1
6126	3300	I say no because, future generations need to know of the material, it @MONTH1 not always be offensive, and the public libraries have no right to tell us what we can, and cannot read	2
6127	3300	Some say that our future generations will be greatly shorted of knowledge, or become naive because of this lack of knowledge	3
6128	3300	I say this is because of the censorship in libraries	4
6129	3300	Katherine paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other chilren have taken off the shelf	5
6130	3300	But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	6
6131	3300	An then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So if they're taking books off the shelve because they find them offensive, then there will be so many books gone, that the kids will not have a broder view as so many people are lucky to have today	7
6132	3300	Everyone has a different oppinion about everything, including what's offensive and what's not	8
6133	3300	If one person see's a book as being offensive, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone else will also	9
6134	3300	I've heard of teachers not letting the students see pictures of The @CAPS1, because the think it's offensive	10
6135	3300	Not everyone agrees with that	11
6136	3300	The @CAPS1 is a big part in history and it being catorgorized as offensive is wrong, it's not the only thing in history that is bad	12
6137	3300	If they start taking out big parts of history, it will be long lost and forgotten	13
6138	3300	Lastly i believe that the libraries should not be able to tell us what we can and cannot read	14
6139	3300	We have the right to choose what we want to read, if we think that it's bad and shouldn't be reading it, then we won't read it	15
6140	3300	But that doesn't mean they should take out the book because one person finds it offesive	16
6141	3300	Someone else might want to read it	17
6142	3300	I think that people are mature enough to pick what they read, and as for children their parents are the one's that could pick for them	18
6143	3300	With so many different oppinions it's hard to decide what to do about censorship, I believe that if it's offensive maybe they should have a special section for explicit media and reading	19
6144	3300	Maybe then people wouldn't be offended by it	20
6145	3300	Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean another wouldn't either.	21
6146	3301	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,      @CAPS3, my name is @PERSON1 and I think that everyone has a right to there own opinion	0
6147	3301	People @MONTH1 not want there kids to look at certain things but, they need to keep them were there kids cant find them	1
6148	3301	Kids in the world hear bad language, see fighting, and even see people get shot	2
6149	3301	There is a lot more bad things in life than a movies, books, and music that childreen listen to, watch, or read	3
6150	3301	I think that the world is more harmfull sometime than anything	4
6151	3301	Adults @MONTH1 want kids to grow up differently than others so they need to tell them not to be listening and watching the bad things on tv	5
6152	3301	But, if there kids wanna learn about things that happen thats not the greatest, then people should let them	6
6153	3301	It wouldn't be right if people or movies or things had to change just because other people dont like it	7
6154	3301	Why should other people have to change just for the ones who dont like it	8
6155	3301	There are some materials that are bad but can be only purchesed at the age of eight-teen	9
6156	3301	Thats why people should be ok with things that dont envolve minors	10
6157	3301	Having things censored ruins a lot of things, the fact that its was made that way it should be kept that way	11
6158	3301	I'm sure many people @MONTH1 not agree with my report but, it's something to look and think about	12
6159	3301	People wouldn't make the things they do if it was supposed to be censored	13
6160	3301	That takes the whole meaning out of a lot of things	14
6161	3301	So my answer is NO about taking things away that are not censored	15
6162	3301	Keep them so people can understand life the easy way and the hard way	16
6163	3301	Sincerely,      @PERSON1	17
6164	3302	I believe as a citizen of this city and as a avid library goer, that censorship in libraries is neccessary	0
6165	3302	Some of the material in the libraries @DATE1 are very graphic and sometimes quite a bit offensive	1
6166	3302	Do we really want our children looking at half-nude people or the murder of innocent people just because of their skin color	2
6167	3302	In @DATE1's libraries there are many books and movies that represent racism	3
6168	3302	Take for instance the movie '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1.' In the movie the white children get yelled at because they are playing with the @CAPS3-@CAPS4 children	4
6169	3302	This is a wonderful example of why censorship is neccessary	5
6170	3302	Just think, if your child were to watch this and then go and say something rude to one of their friends, who is @CAPS3-@CAPS4, it would be very offensive to them	6
6171	3302	Although this movie is about historical events, it still needs to be taken off the shelves, in @CAPS1 opinion	7
6172	3302	In @DATE1's society, nudity is becoming a big issue in movies and also in books	8
6173	3302	You @MONTH1 think that it is okay to let  your child watch a movie rated @NUM1, but little did you know, there is nudity in it	9
6174	3302	Depending on how old your child is, and if you let them on the computer or not, they might think it is okay to go and look up nude pictures on the internet	10
6175	3302	Also, in books this is becoming an issue	11
6176	3302	It was just the other day I sat down to read a book about a musical that I wish to see, and there were nude pictures in it	12
6177	3302	Once I found this out, I asked @CAPS1 mother to please take it back	13
6178	3302	These are the sort of things that need to be taken off the shelves of our libraries	14
6179	3302	Language usage in music is also a big deal	15
6180	3302	Many rap artists think it is okay to use offensive and explicit language in their music	16
6181	3302	I do not think they take into consideration that young children will be listening to their music	17
6182	3302	This genre of music needs to be taken off the shelves	18
6183	3302	You @MONTH1 think it is okay for your young child to listen to it now, but just wait until those words make it into their vocabulary	19
6184	3302	I think that library censorship is a big deal that needs to be taken into deep consideration	20
6185	3302	It @MONTH1 be different at first, especially when you go in to get your favorite rap tape, or your favorite @NUM1 movie, but trust me in the long run, you will thank the library for taking it off the shelves	21
6186	3302	Especially when you get older and have children	22
6187	3302	You will not want them listening, reading, or watching the things you watched as a child	23
6188	3305	Why should books or other such ideas but lets get back to the subject	0
6189	3305	Should certain books be aloud to be in a libary	1
6190	3305	Cause if u dont have certain books you would have to read the same book over and over	2
6191	3305	But there are all kinds of books that you can pick you have history,poems,dramas,love,scary	3
6192	3305	But some are not aporpit for certain places	4
6193	3305	Certain music is ok but there are some that I would not aprove of	5
6194	3305	Like there rap its a bunch of people rymes	6
6195	3305	That people think up in there heads about life	7
6196	3305	Something that they want to express by telling raping	8
6197	3305	There is rock in roll alot of people did not care for it	9
6198	3305	When it was intruduces in the late @NUM1 but as time went on people started listening to it	10
6199	3305	But alot of people did not want there kids listening	11
6200	3305	To that back then they said it was devil music	12
6201	3305	But in this day in age alot of people still listen to rock n roll	13
6202	3305	Cause they were brought up on that kind of music	14
6203	3305	Movies there is a lot of diffent movies out there	15
6204	3305	There @NUM2 and rated @CAPS1 but alot of partents do not let there kids	16
6205	3305	Watch certain movies because they scare there kids	17
6206	3305	They are so ugly and gross that some people cant stand it	18
6207	3305	But there are shows for kids to there like a movie but a little shorter	19
6208	3305	Magazines just are a new thing that people are trying out	20
6209	3305	But mostly old people read magazines cause they have alot of time on there hands	21
6210	3305	But there are some people who cant get ehogh of magazines	22
6211	3305	Cause they want to buy every thing in the book	23
6212	3305	It catchs there eyes bye the way it looks 	24
6213	3305	But there is all kinds of diffent magazines mucle, food ,cleaning, toys	25
6214	3305	But thats what I think about this kind 	26
6215	3305	Of stuff it sucks people in but some cant get out	27
6216	3305	By the time they get out they are broke	28
6217	3306	If we were to take away every thing that someone in the world finds offensive, there would be nothing left	0
6218	3306	Many people in different cultures find many different things offensive	1
6219	3306	it's not right to take away from others something becuase a select group of people take offense at it	2
6220	3306	Something being offensive isn't always a bad thing	3
6221	3306	There's many different reason why, but removing something because of someone else's opinion isn't right	4
6222	3306	First, whether you find something offensive or not, is laregly based on your culture	5
6223	3306	To most @CAPS1 cultures, declining food is offensive	6
6224	3306	To @CAPS2, eating or hurting cows in anyway is a complete disgrace	7
6225	3306	If something is offensive to one person, it @MONTH1 be because they have a different background	8
6226	3306	You're never going to please everyone	9
6227	3306	Second, one of the best thing's about the @LOCATION1 is that you can have your own beliefs	10
6228	3306	If something was removed from the shelf at a library, because someone found it offensive, I would be disturbed	11
6229	3306	I have my own beliefs that I'm sure not everyone agrees with	12
6230	3306	Some of my beliefs wuold be offensive to certain people	13
6231	3306	That doesn't mean I should have to stay silent about my beliefs, does it	14
6232	3306	No, of course not	15
6233	3306	I wouldn't want anyone else's beliefs forced on me	16
6234	3306	I'm sure no one wants my beliefs forced on them	17
6235	3306	By removing things from a shlef becuase took offense at it, you'd be removing freedom of speech from the shelf also	18
6236	3306	That's not only wrong, it's illegal	19
6237	3306	Some people would be offended at a book with a cross on it	20
6238	3306	Some people would be offended by a @CAPS3 cover with a pentgram	21
6239	3306	That doesn't mean they should be taken away	22
6240	3306	It's good to get offended sometimes	23
6241	3306	It often makes people stand up for what they believe	24
6242	3306	To me, it's reminder of why I believe what I do	25
6243	3306	I @MONTH1 be angered by what I see	26
6244	3306	I'm sure the terrorist group @ORGANIZATION1 is greatly offended when they see the @CAPS4 flag	27
6245	3306	We wouldn't stop waving it, would we	28
6246	3306	That'd be absurd	29
6247	3306	Just because someone takes offense at something doesn't make it wrong	30
6248	3306	It never has	31
6249	3306	It just means they have different beliefs	32
6250	3306	We should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding that it be removed	33
6251	3306	I personally believe that removing things from the public eye, merely because they're offensive, would be wrong for many reasons	34
6252	3306	So many people find so many thigs offensive	35
6253	3306	It'd take away everythign if we removed eac and every one	36
6254	3306	Removing offensive items would also be an intrusion of freedom of speech	37
6255	3306	Plus, many things that are offensive often remind of of who we are	38
6256	3306	We should be string enough to look away and not fight about it	39
6257	3306	I don't think they should be removed	40
6258	3306	I want my library to be what @CAPS5 was made to be, a mixture of cultures and backgrounds	41
6259	3306	I don't think anything should be removed unless it directly causes harm to people	42
6260	3307	Durning school one day all of our teachers told the class that most of the books in the libary is going to be took off the shelves	0
6261	3307	But our class don't want that to happen	1
6262	3307	All the teachers told us that some people parents has been complaning about what there kids are reading	2
6263	3307	I thank that most the the books that are in the libary is good for the kids to look at because thats what they like annd they like to learn about what would like to have or do someday	3
6264	3307	I also thank that it is a good thing that kids are wanting to learn about what they want to do later in life	4
6265	3307	Later in life when I have kids I would like them to dream about what they want to do in there life	5
6266	3307	So if that means that they want to go to school and look at magazines all day and make sure that thats what he wants to do thats fine with me	6
6267	3307	So if the teachers want the books off the shelves they can but I don't think that the kids are going to try much if they cant be what they want to be later in there life time	7
6268	3307	I know that if they did that to my kids that I know I would buy them all the magazines thay want so they can learn what they want to do in life	8
6269	3307	So if they take all the books off the shelves I know that all the kids parents are probley going to get mad because thats what messes up the kids dreams	9
6270	3307	Know when the kids what to read the schools is taking all the good books off the shelves none of the kids are going to know what they want to do in there later life	10
6271	3307	A good thing to do is to let the studends vote and see what the what to do about taking the books off the shelves	11
6272	3307	I bet most of the students in this world would say to keep them on the shelves because they like to read and look at pictures	12
6273	3307	That means that they want to be something when they grow up	13
6274	3307	I hope that my kid whats to be something that he likes to do when he grows up	14
6275	3307	I will help any kid as much as I can with there dreams	15
6276	3307	There is two things that are going to happen	16
6277	3307	One is that the school is going to take the books off the shelves and the students are not doing to try in school and they might not know what they want to be	17
6278	3307	Or they might just give up on it all	18
6279	3307	And I know that know one whats that to happen	19
6280	3307	The second thing is that the schools is going to keep the books on the shelves and the students are going to want to read them more	20
6281	3307	Also they will probley know want whey want to do later in there life time	21
6282	3307	If I could pick what to do I would keep the books on the shelves and make the kid happy	22
6283	3308	Everyone has their own opinion on censorship in libraries.I think that what libraries choose to put on their shelves should not be censored	0
6284	3308	Every human being does not have the same taste in what they read, listen to, look at, and watch	1
6285	3308	In todays generation everyone has their own opinon on censorship	2
6286	3308	I do not agree with censorship because not everyone likes the same things, has the same thoughts, has the same lifestyle, and wants to learn the same things	3
6287	3308	Everyone is an individual and is different in their own way	4
6288	3308	If libraries wanted to censor what they put out not everyone would get to read, listen, and watch what they wanted	5
6289	3308	Having libraries censor things would make people feel left out	6
6290	3308	For example if the library only put out romance things, then what would the action lovers do 	7
6291	3308	A library is for anyone and everyone who goes to it	8
6292	3308	One specific type of person does not go to the library	9
6293	3308	Everyone grows up in a different lifestyle	10
6294	3308	Children do not choose their parents	11
6295	3308	Some parents censor what their kids read and watch,and some do not	12
6296	3308	Kids who have parents that do not censor what they choose to get at the library might have differnt interests	13
6297	3308	Not everyone likes the same things	14
6298	3308	In school most of the time everyone learns the basic information that is required	15
6299	3308	Outside of school there is so much more to learn	16
6300	3308	People can go to librarys' and learn about differnt things that they want to learn about	17
6301	3308	What people choose to study in their free time can range from drugs and sex to @CAPS1.If libraries censored what people can read, watch, listen to not everyone would get to learn extra information that they wanted to	18
6302	3308	Libraries can not censor  their materials	19
6303	3308	I do not agree with libraries censoring what materials they choose to put out for the public.People are differnt and that is okay	20
6304	3308	If libraries choose to censor things then not everyone would have equal opprotunities	21
6305	3308	Parents can censor what their kids read if they want	22
6306	3308	Not every parents chooses to censor what their kids get at the library	23
6307	3308	therefore kids have different interests	24
6308	3308	Human beings do not always want to learn the same things	25
6309	3308	The librarys' who choose to censor what they put out is not letting everyone have a equal chance to learn	26
6310	3308	Please let people be who they want to be	27
6311	3308	Do not censor what libraries put out such as books, music, movies, and magazines	28
6312	3309	I beleive it is wrong to remove books from library shelves even if they are found offensive	0
6313	3309	I have three reasons to support this statement	1
6314	3309	These reasons are knowledge, different sections of the library, and freedom	2
6315	3309	I will explain these reasons below but before I begin I would like to add that most people want to censor things that they fear	3
6316	3309	If a book is removed from a shelf because someone finds it offensive then the next person who comes along looking for that book can not access it	4
6317	3309	How is that fair	5
6318	3309	In life there are many things that can offend people but thats life, you have to learn to let those things go	6
6319	3309	Everyone has a right to form their own views and oppinions on things, but they can not if they do not read other people's oppinions	7
6320	3309	Reading expands our vacabulary, at any age	8
6321	3309	Just because you do not like something does not mean someone else also can not like it	9
6322	3309	You have to give them a chance to form an oppionion	10
6323	3309	Library's are everywhere	11
6324	3309	If you are concerned about your children finding books that you do not want them to see then take them to a library with sections	12
6325	3309	All libraries are broken down in sections	13
6326	3309	Keep your children in the 'children' section and there should not be any concerns in that area	14
6327	3309	Once your children get older allow them to roam the library and develope an oppinion on what types of books they enjoy most	15
6328	3309	We live in @LOCATION1, which since founded has been all about freedom	16
6329	3309	Some people do not have the money to buy books, or internet, So these people rely on public libraries	17
6330	3309	If they look for books and can not find a subject that interests them they will not read	18
6331	3309	They could even be looking for a specific book and not be able to find it because it was taken off the shelf	19
6332	3309	There is also a religion conflict	20
6333	3309	There are many different versions of the @CAPS1 but, many different religions	21
6334	3309	People come from all backgrounds so if they do not beleive in the @CAPS1 do we take that off the shelves too	22
6335	3309	In closing I would like to add that I can also see why people would want to censor certain things	23
6336	3309	However most of the things people do not like to see are things they fear	24
6337	3309	These people can not hide from reality, not everything in the world is good, so let's not pretend everything is perfect and do our best to contribute to the wellness of society	25
6338	3309	What better way than letting everyone read whatever they wish	26
6339	3310	Cooling the @CAPS1: @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 From Book @PERSON1 _________     Censorship in public libraries would be an insult to the institution	0
6340	3310	A library, a citadel of knowledge, should not be bound by a society as to what knowledge it can convey	1
6341	3310	One point of a library, the destination of researchers, is to offer information that must be sought: for those who cannot find the information in their homes without fear, for those who cannot ask their questions without retribution, the library stands as a pillar of safety	2
6342	3310	Books are incapable of judgment	3
6343	3310	To censor the books held in a library is to chip away at human progress	4
6344	3310	A freedom of thought and a freedom of press, present within our nation and increasing in presence around the @CAPS5, precludes the idea of this censorship	5
6345	3310	If any book is subject to criticism or opposition, are not all books worthy of the same	6
6346	3310	To value one opinion or perspective less than another is to debase the entire culture from which libraries have arisen	7
6347	3310	Libraries are a communal institution, open to all views and writings	8
6348	3310	The point of bringing books together under one roof is to equate them, and give them all equal standing as literature or scholarly works	9
6349	3310	From personal experience, censorship in the library has cost me precious time, and has stolen from me parts of my life	10
6350	3310	Growing up in a small town, where ideas of gender and sexuality were somewhat firmly set, any search for dissenting opinion was often fruitless	11
6351	3310	When I visited my school's library, as a child searching for answers about my sexuality, I found little aid	12
6352	3310	Around the library were a thousand stories of a man and woman falling in love, but never did I find a fairy tale of two princes	13
6353	3310	It was not until I left the school that I found that such books did exist in my old school library, but kept removed, off the shelves, restricted	14
6354	3310	More insulting than finding books of @CAPS4 issues completely unrepresented was to find that they were treated so separately	15
6355	3310	Here lies the problem	16
6356	3310	Some people believe that if minority opinions or values are unrepresented, they will disappear	17
6357	3310	Such is the point of censorship: ignoring an issue or a life-choice to the point of extinction	18
6358	3310	But books cannot shout their values	19
6359	3310	They cannot shove information down our throats	20
6360	3310	Books must be read, we must give our consent to their knowledge	21
6361	3310	Unlike an advertisement that might accost us unawares, we must pick up a book and open it to receive its guidance	22
6362	3310	If my library had done its job and given me the guidance I sought, I would have grown so much more easily	23
6363	3310	I would have learned not only how to express and accept myself, but I might have grown to more easily accept others as well	24
6364	3310	In the past few years, with the effects of @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 reaching the newest generation, @LOCATION1 has searched for ways to pay homage to the victims of the violence of @CAPS8 and of the @CAPS9	25
6365	3310	What the country finds, however, is that it cannot effectively memorialize the tragedies	26
6366	3310	In trying construct a monument, the government and culture find that they have little to build off of	27
6367	3310	The products of murder and book-burning have resulted in an emptiness, a void	28
6368	3310	As such, architects have created what @MONTH1 be called 'anti-monuments', commemorating a void to posterity to memorialize what was lost	29
6369	3310	One of the most powerful, to me at least, appears in the form of a negative bookshelf: a solid wall, with gaping holes in the form of book spines, ranging across the rows	30
6370	3310	Such is the knowledge lost from book-burning	31
6371	3310	We cannot even describe what is lost, for the knowledge has vanished	32
6372	3310	We must ask, what are we missing	33
6373	3310	What views, what prose, what beauty has been taking from us while we continue living, never having the chance to glimpse it	34
6374	3310	This is the effect of library censorship	35
6375	3310	To remove a book from its natural and rightful place on a shelf is to set its words aflame	36
6376	3310	Once it is gone, it will be forgotten	37
6377	3310	To protect our posterity, to enlighten our descendants, we must work to preserve all books, any book that appears offensive, or disgusting, or brave, or new	38
6378	3310	Let the reader decide its value	39
6379	3310	Let the person in search of answers pick it up or leave it behind	40
6380	3310	Give the book a chance for it @MONTH1 have a power that is unrealized	41
6381	3310	Leave the libraries as they are, as the monuments to the preservation and progression of knowledge and wisdom.	42
6382	3311	Have you ever wondered how libraries pick their books	0
6383	3311	Well, I know I have	1
6384	3311	There are some material out there that no one wants a little kid to get a hold of	2
6385	3311	I believe censorship should be allowed in libraries, because the censorship of books is vital for the kids of the world to live a life without books about violence, another reason is that it not only affects the lives of the children, but the social lives of everyone, and the overrated music of our generation	3
6386	3311	My reasons on this subject can be viewed in two different ways, but I would like to view it in my way	4
6387	3311	Look around, are their little children around	5
6388	3311	Well, if there is I would be looking at what they are reading or doing	6
6389	3311	The children might be reading books that are too explicit for their age	7
6390	3311	Take for example, a child that is six years old, and can do whatever he or she wants	8
6391	3311	They have no limits	9
6392	3311	So, one day the child decides I am going to check out a book at the library	10
6393	3311	The child obtains a book that is about violence and sex	11
6394	3311	What does the parent do when that child brings that book home	12
6395	3311	Nothing	13
6396	3311	The parents do nothing because they do not care about their own child	14
6397	3311	The time is now to step up to the plate, librarians	15
6398	3311	Take a stand and censor those books	16
6399	3311	This is what could happen to anyones child if there are books out their that could be harmful to anyone that picks them up	17
6400	3311	Children aren't the only ones that are harmed by this deadly disease called noncensored books	18
6401	3311	Think about the conversations that go on in schools and at the work place	19
6402	3311	What are the conversations mostly about	20
6403	3311	I would take a wild guess that they are mostly about sex and violence	21
6404	3311	How do these conversations come up	22
6405	3311	Well, the only reason is uncensored books at the library	23
6406	3311	Anyone can check out a book at the library	24
6407	3311	It could be the elderly all the way down to toddlers	25
6408	3311	When I was little, my parents use to tell to go to the library and learn something	26
6409	3311	What if the library didn't have censored books, what would I be reading	27
6410	3311	Social lives are very affected by what they learn and how they learn the material	28
6411	3311	Lastly, why is that everyone time I turn on the radio, there is always a song that is not right for anyone to listen to	29
6412	3311	I listen to the radio station @NUM1 sometimes and all the music is mostly about violence	30
6413	3311	Guess what the libraries have some of these compact discs of these artists that are played on this radio station	31
6414	3311	At the library, there is a music section, movie section, and lastly the books	32
6415	3311	All of that material combined can create a social disaster, if the material isn't censored	33
6416	3311	I believe that censored music is the best path to go, because our world wouldn't be obsessed with violence if they have never read or learned about it	34
6417	3311	Why should we have to suffer anymore with uncensored books at the library	35
6418	3311	Take a chance and fight for what you believe in and vote for censored books	36
6419	3311	A library is a place to sit and enjoy the surroundings	37
6420	3311	It is not a place for violence, so quit with it, go for a safer environment	38
6421	3311	No one deserves to be offered the damaging violence of uncensored books, and music	39
6422	3312	'@CAPS1', the woman shreaked as she had just received a fierce, sharp,and quick stab in the back by her abusive husband	0
6423	3312	This is the kind of violence children read about all around the @CAPS2	1
6424	3312	To think all of the innapropriate stuff children see around the @CAPS2 in television, the internet, and even what classmates are talking about isn't enough, well you are wrong	2
6425	3312	Some of the things you read and hear about in books are totally unacceptable	3
6426	3312	This is why books, and magazines need to be censored in libraries all around the @CAPS2	4
6427	3312	In our community library in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 we have magazines, in which case these magazines are very graphic	5
6428	3312	Kid's will read these over any learning or interesting book	6
6429	3312	Many kid's draw disrespectful things in them	7
6430	3312	As to think that wasn't ignorant enough they also rip them in half and do many other dismantling things to them	8
6431	3312	One of the reasons why I feel that the @CAPS2 has so much trouble with criminal people is kids feel these days that they are allowed to draw in books and rip them in half even though they aren't their property	9
6432	3312	Which allowes them to think they can do whatever they want	10
6433	3312	Kids read about crazy things that aren't necessaarily teaching you anything	11
6434	3312	Unless that is you want to learn about having a zombi apocalypse and zombies take over the @CAPS2	12
6435	3312	To have that in a school public library what is that teaching kid's	13
6436	3312	Absolutely nothing, but to teach them to take them home and show there little brother or sister a cuss word in the book is teaching them bad things	14
6437	3312	These are all some valid points as to censor or take out some of the leisurely reading books in the libraries, or to possibly censor some of the cussing	15
6438	3312	The last point I will be touching on this discussion is the loss of money that some of the schools have due to damaged books and stolen property	16
6439	3312	Also to mention all of the dirty pictures kid's draw in the magazines and books	17
6440	3312	Schools lose a great deal of money just to touch that point	18
6441	3312	They would save a much needed amount of money if they didn't let those books leave the classroom or school library	19
6442	3312	Kid's wouldn't be able to draw in them or steal them or even damage them and all the money they could save and put it towards something learn fulfilling	20
6443	3312	Well behaved children all around the @CAPS2 is what you can look forward to if you censor books and magazines all around the @CAPS2 in libraries	21
6444	3312	If you dont let them be taken out of the library how could kids possibly damage or steal or even draw in them	22
6445	3312	By not allowing kid's do do whatever they want and showing some authority lets kid's around the @CAPS2 know they need to show some respect	23
6446	3312	With all the money libraries and schools save they can put it towards something learn fulfilling	24
6447	3312	If you could please take the information i have given you and think about it, it would be greatly appreciated	25
6448	3313	I believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries	0
6449	3313	There are some books out there that could be a little offensive and cause some problems, but I also believe that even if a book is insulting you shouldn't be able to hide it from others	1
6450	3313	There are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library	2
6451	3313	Since a library is public lots of people go in to get books	3
6452	3313	What is to stop a kid to getting to one of these books, or movies you can find in libraries	4
6453	3313	Do you really want a child to check something out that has violence, horrible language, and sexual innuedo	5
6454	3313	What can you do about this problem	6
6455	3313	You could censorship the books and hide them from the public, but that would cause another problem	7
6456	3313	The idea of censorship might sound ok, but really it's not the right thing to do	8
6457	3313	Hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a little over the top	9
6458	3313	If you are an adult and your in the mood to read something with a little violence in it you'd have to go somewhere else because someone just took that book away because it had some swear words that they don't find appropriate in books	10
6459	3313	Censorship would just make it harder for adults to find some books that they would want to read	11
6460	3313	So what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf	12
6461	3313	Do you just leave it there, or take it away so no one can read it	13
6462	3313	You could just put age restrictions on the books	14
6463	3313	If someone underage wanted to check out the book, they would have to get permission from their parent	15
6464	3313	That way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone	16
6465	3314	People all judge things differently	0
6466	3314	Thats why I feel that libraries should keep those kinds of books	1
6467	3314	What @MONTH1 be found as a offenisve book to one person might not to another one	2
6468	3314	If there are people saying that the certain books are offensive, then they should take them out of the library	3
6469	3314	You shouldn't take one book out because one person thinks it is offensive	4
6470	3314	What might be offensive to one person @MONTH1 interest another	5
6471	3314	The person that doesn't think it is, should have the right to read the book	6
6472	3314	That would be taking the rights for people away because a person finds it offensive	7
6473	3314	The person might find the book useful because they want to learn about the topic more	8
6474	3314	They will never get to learn about it if they take the book out because one person finds it offensive or doesn't like it	9
6475	3314	I personally like watching movies or reading books that are thrilling and @MONTH1 have some violence in them	10
6476	3314	If the library took these books or movies out because a mother saw her son or daughter read or waching then it would be wrong	11
6477	3314	The mother would be taking away what I like to read and watch	12
6478	3314	Thats not fair at all	13
6479	3314	A way to solve this issue is to have certain areas for each type of age group	14
6480	3314	therefore, they would be watching or reading types of things acceptable for their age group	15
6481	3314	I understand the fact that some people take things offensively	16
6482	3314	Also that they don't want their children to pick up a book or movie that isn't acceptable for their age group	17
6483	3314	They have to understand though that sometime people like those type of things, and they are taking it away from the people who enjoy them	18
6484	3314	It is like taking rights away from people because they don't agree with what is happening	19
6485	3314	It wouldn't be right at all to take those books out of the library	20
6486	3314	All people have different views about things	21
6487	3314	You can't change a thing if one person doesn't like it	22
6488	3314	People have rights to pick up a book if they want to or not	23
6489	3314	Not everyone is the same, so not all people are going to think the same way	24
6490	3314	I like things that some people might not like, that is just how human nature is	25
6491	3315	Over time, libraries have been used as a big resource when doing reports, researching, renting movies and simply trying to find something new to read	0
6492	3315	They have been used as a gate way for an extensive world of reading and learning	1
6493	3315	All libraries should have the right to have the content they please to have on thier shelves	2
6494	3315	No book, music, movie, magazine , etc., should ever be denied a place on the shelve because of it's content	3
6495	3315	Sex, drugs, violence	4
6496	3315	There are many books over these topics that many people @MONTH1 find offensive or just completely oblivious	5
6497	3315	Every mind is diffrent when it comes down to what it likes to read, watch or hear	6
6498	3315	No mind is the same, so no mind will ever like exactly the same thing	7
6499	3315	When ever someone wants to go buy a book about safe sex, it should not be denied to them because the library does not allow it	8
6500	3315	It should be placed on a different section of the library	9
6501	3315	Many books that people find as explicit content to them, @MONTH1 not be to others	10
6502	3315	When i was in middle school, i heard alot about sex, and drugs	11
6503	3315	I never knew what it felt like or how did it feel	12
6504	3315	What i did know was that I could get accesible information from my local library	13
6505	3315	What happens when a child wants to know more than she does	14
6506	3315	She looks, and researches it	15
6507	3315	If i would have been denied the access to books about sex or drugs, I would have probabaly never been warned about the out comes or the seriousness of them both	16
6508	3315	When you walk into a libraby and observe	17
6509	3315	Not everyone is reading a book about rainbows, and unicorns	18
6510	3315	Many people read books about the real life, books that they can relate to	19
6511	3315	Many of those books that many people read are those that others calls explicit	20
6512	3315	The purpose of a library is to have access to books, magazines, music, and movies of all kind of content, reguardless of others concerns	21
6513	3315	Also, Libraries can do many things so that certain contents @MONTH1 not be near others	22
6514	3315	They can organize there topics and genres	23
6515	3315	Explicit, or eighteen or older books, movies, magazines or music @MONTH1 be placed in a back room or simply on another side of the library	24
6516	3315	Far from the reach where kids and children are able to access	25
6517	3315	In conclusion I believe with my strongly supportive ideas that books, magazines,  music or movies should not be removed if found offensive because every book has a right on the shelve no matter what	26
6518	3315	No book should be removed because someone @MONTH1 find it offensive	27
6519	3315	If a person finds something offensive they should take it up with the author or publishers not the library for they only let people borrow the conten	28
6520	3316	Censorship is a topic that it strongly opinionated	0
6521	3316	If one person does not like the content of a text, that person could might find themselves saying that they have to right to obstain from being able to view that text in a library, public location, or online source	1
6522	3316	But what about the other people	2
6523	3316	Shouldn't they have a say too	3
6524	3316	Let's say that 'person one' does not agree with the language in a text, but 'person two', perhaps does	4
6525	3316	Which person has the benefit in @CAPS1 situation	5
6526	3316	Freedom of speech and expression are two factors that are very valued, and pherhaps sometimes even overlooked in our society	6
6527	3316	In @CAPS1 case, both 'person one' and 'person two' are allowed have a right to say and think what they feel about the text	7
6528	3316	Should 'person one' still have the right to say that @CAPS1 text does not belong in a public location	8
6529	3316	Well, if every person had the right to remove something that they disagreed with from the public, there nothing would be left	9
6530	3316	In such a large and diverse society, there is bound to be at least one person who does not agree with the content of a certain material of each and every lyric, magazing, book, and text that there is avalible	10
6531	3316	Some might say that @CAPS1 is unfair to that one group who does not agree with the content of a material	11
6532	3316	But how is that fair to the other group who actually do agree with that material	12
6533	3316	Freedom of speech and expression are still not being excluded from that group who does not agree with such material	13
6534	3316	That group is still allowed to speak their opinions and takes on that particular material, as well as the people who do agree with the material	14
6535	3316	Take iTunes for example	15
6536	3316	If there is a song that has language and/or content that could be considered disrespectful to a person, there is a red tag by the song that says: 'explecit.' @CAPS1 is an indecator that a person who could find foul language offensive, that such person should no buy that song	16
6537	3316	There is also the compromise	17
6538	3316	Quite often, if a song is tagged as 'explecit', the is usually an alternative of the same song	18
6539	3316	That same song is then tagged with a gray tag that states: 'clean.' A song being 'clean' simply means that the song is still the same, but the considered to be disrespectful content is removed, or removed and replaced with different words that are not considered to be disrespectful	19
6540	3316	Both parties are now satisfied with the so called: happy-median	20
6541	3316	Take movies as another example	21
6542	3316	Movies are rated based on their content	22
6543	3316	The higher the rating, the more explecit such movie is	23
6544	3316	Along with the rating, there is an explanation as to why that movie is rated the way that it is	24
6545	3316	If you are a person who is careful about viewing things that are against your own opinions and beliefs, then by seeing the rating and explanation, such person knows that @CAPS1 material is not for them	25
6546	3316	Again, the happy-median	26
6547	3316	For every given case of a goup of people who do not agree with the terms of a certain content, the alternate group must be considered as well	27
6548	3316	Both parties in @CAPS1 case are still able to say and express their own opinions	28
6549	3316	So, should @CAPS1 context be removed from the eye of the public because a certain group of people do not agree with the content in it	29
6550	3316	No	30
6551	3316	However, one must keep in mind the views and opinions that each person has on such material, and that person should still be respected for their take on that material	31
6552	3318	New @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3     Have you ever seen a movie or read a book that you did not want your kids/family to read	0
6553	3318	I know I have, and sometimes there is no stopping them from seeing or reading those books/movies	1
6554	3318	I don't necessarily think the offensive books should be removed, but I think they should be relocated to a different part of the @CAPS3	2
6555	3318	This @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 should only be entered by an adult, or with an adults permission	3
6556	3318	Little kids see stuff that their peers are doing and want to be just like them so they do the same stuff	4
6557	3318	What the kids don't realize is that most of it is fake, and the things that happen in movies aren't really true	5
6558	3318	By having this seperated @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3, it gives parents the chance to get the racist, drug/gang filled, and murder books away from the children	6
6559	3318	This will be good for every race too	7
6560	3318	If an african american family does not want there child to be reading books about slavery or gangs, they can keep them out of the @CAPS1 of books where slavery and gangs are	8
6561	3318	Some books are really emotional and can trigger a persons emotions	9
6562	3318	If someone is going through a really hard time and they read a book about suicide, they are more likely to think about killing themself	10
6563	3318	I think by separating the bad influencing books from the good influencing books it well help alot	11
6564	3318	People under the age of @NUM1 are not permitted to be in this @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 without a parent, or parent signature	12
6565	3318	So come on down to the @CAPS2 council on @DATE1 and vote for the new @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3	13
6566	3318	Thank you for your time.	14
6567	3319	Censorships in the libraris  would be liked cutting the worlds air supply	0
6568	3319	It would be taking away from a readers imagintion	1
6569	3319	stoping readers from being able to express their mind	2
6570	3319	My veiw on censorship in the libraries would not be needed	3
6571	3319	Libraries around the world do good jobs keeping certain books in the apperpate ages levels	4
6572	3319	By removing certain materials out of libraries would cause reader attention to why their being removed	5
6573	3319	Then readers would demanded that we leave their books alone	6
6574	3319	Then fight for more books like those and then they would need censorships in libraries	7
6575	3319	Books were made to keeping people wondering, learning, and excited	8
6576	3319	By cutting away different materials would be stopping people from enjoying the world of minds	9
6577	3319	More you take books away the more the population on watching television gets higher	10
6578	3319	Then there would be no more author and more actors and actress	11
6579	3319	People minds would not be wondering, learning or being kept excited	12
6580	3319	I remember when i was a little girl i went to the library	13
6581	3319	I was in the library looking for a book	14
6582	3319	I wet to the big kids side as i called it and tried to check the book out	15
6583	3319	The library lady told me i was to young and showed me to my age level books and took the book back	16
6584	3319	Then i was able to check a book out	17
6585	3319	So all i am sating is that censorships are not needed in libraries	18
6586	3319	That would be tking away from a librarains job	19
6587	3319	So dont take away readrs imagintion	20
6588	3320	There is a certain amount of responsibility when it comes to censoring all the different types of media and literature	0
6589	3320	Deciding whose responsibility that is can be a difficult task	1
6590	3320	Children can be strongly influenced by all media out there and making that material has been made easily accessible	2
6591	3320	When someone comes of age to make decisions that affect their life then they should be able to	3
6592	3320	Shop owners should be able to sell whatever they want in order to make a living	4
6593	3320	When children go to a library usually they will not do so alone	5
6594	3320	Parents can decide what their child is allowed to take home or not	6
6595	3320	When a child comes to their parent with a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive or inappropriate it comes to the parent to decide whether or not they want their child to be exposed to that material	7
6596	3320	If the parent allowed for their child to have access to offensive media then that can give the child the idea that what they are looking at or reading is alright	8
6597	3320	If someone has come of age and has all the other freedoms that everyone else has they should be allowed to buy, read, and watch what they want	9
6598	3320	To prove to someone that you are of age to have access to offensive material you should have to show some sort of identification proving it	10
6599	3320	A shop owner or businessman/woman should be able to sell whatever he or she wants to in order to make a living as long as it stays within the boundaries of the law	11
6600	3320	Having someone who does not work in the law or a person who is not a legal guardian or parent of someone who is not of age should not tell someone not to buy, read, or watch something just because it might be offensive or offend that one person	12
6601	3320	I conclude that in order for a someone to tell another person not to buy or rent material that person would either have to be law enforcement or their legal guardian as long as they are not of age	13
6602	3320	There is no reason why people should not be able to access material that is not against the law	14
6603	3320	If someone is offended by some literature then they should try to make it against the law.	15
6604	3321	Censorship, thats a word that causes alot of arguements in today's society	0
6605	3321	People have extremely different views on censorship throughout the world	1
6606	3321	In some countries dictators do @CAPS4 allow their citizens to have internet access watch the news or in some more extreme cases @CAPS4 even watch television at all	2
6607	3321	The majority of the time they do this because they do @CAPS4 want the citiznes of their country to know what is happening around the world	3
6608	3321	This sets up a 'fish bowl' environment meaning that people from other countries see all of the issues in that country but the people actually in the country have no idea whats going on around them	4
6609	3321	Although we don't always see censorship in that extreme of a sense it is still plays a large part in today's society	5
6610	3321	Everything from music on the radio to military files are censored	6
6611	3321	Think about it, how often can you listen to a song on the radio that all of the original words are still intact	7
6612	3321	Arguements over censorships have gone back and forth for years without really making much prgress at all	8
6613	3321	Each side of the arguement whether its for or against censorship is almost entirely opinionative	9
6614	3321	No one can say for sure that censorship is completely needed or @CAPS4	10
6615	3321	It's just to hard to determine who's opinion is really, more convincing	11
6616	3321	In my opinion I dont think anything should be consored, if the writer of a @CAPS1 show throws in a vulger word most likely it's for the effect that it has on people to show emotion	12
6617	3321	The samething goes for songs, when an artist writes the lyrics to a song they are trying to convey a message and they use certain words that get their point across more effectively or more dramatically	13
6618	3321	Parents argue that their children are seeing to much violence on @CAPS1 and are causing behavior problems along with other things, and that shows need to be more suiting for children	14
6619	3321	There is an alternative to censoring all of these things, rather than 'ruining' everyone's fun just dont let your kids watch that show	15
6620	3321	In the @LOCATION1 today we have something called freedom, we exercise this right everyday with what we wear, and what we say	16
6621	3321	I think that we should take that freedom and apply it to censorship	17
6622	3321	Instead of complaining about violence in movies and sex on @CAPS1 you can make a decision simply to @CAPS4 watch that kind of show	18
6623	3321	Everyone has the option to say NO	19
6624	3321	if you dont want to hear or see something simply choose something else to watch, or even just do someting entirely different	20
6625	3321	You DO @CAPS4 have to do anything that you don't want to do	21
6626	3321	It's is an easy solution, all you have to do is exercise a right that you have had since the day you were born an just say no, I dont want to do that	22
6627	3321	It's very simple and could potentially stop all debates on whether or @CAPS4 things need to be consored.	23
6628	3322	Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1,           Should certain books be removed because some people @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate for their children to see or read	0
6629	3322	No, I do not think they should be removed	1
6630	3322	I honestly think all they all should be put in different sections of the library by age	2
6631	3322	Like all the children books and magizenes should be in one section	3
6632	3322	The younge adult and or teen books and magizenes should be in a section by its self	4
6633	3322	Then the adult books and magizenes should be in their own section	5
6634	3322	Even the autobiographys and documentories should be in their own section too	6
6635	3322	It would make things easier to find the book you are wanting to read	7
6636	3322	For example, if your a teenage girl looking for a book about a high school girl with a crush on a boy, it'd most likely be in the section for the younge adults	8
6637	3322	So yes, the parents that are concerned about their children's viewing of certain books should be able to say something about it	9
6638	3322	But what if one teenager is looking for a book about a famous person's autobiography for a school project	10
6639	3322	Even though it includes how they used to be into drugs as a teenager	11
6640	3322	That person shouldn't have to fail if they can't find it in a library because some concerned parent didn't think it was appropriate	12
6641	3322	Like I said the best thing to do is put all the books in subcatagories by age	13
6642	3322	It would make things was easier and faster to find the book of your selection	14
6643	3323	It seems as if inappropriate materials are found everywhere in today's world	0
6644	3323	In magazines, in books, in the lyrics of music, the possibilities of where to sneak in offensive references are endless, and they certainly pop up everywhere these days	1
6645	3323	But should your resources of where you find these materials be limited due to other people's morals or values	2
6646	3323	I disagree with this act, and I would like to tell you why I do	3
6647	3323	All of us have different morals, values, and sences of what is right and what is wrong	4
6648	3323	everyone's are different	5
6649	3323	Maybe it's your religion or culture that keep you from these materials	6
6650	3323	But why should your values and beliefs dictate what another person can or cannot get from their library	7
6651	3323	I know I don't just speak for myself when I say I would be very annoyed if I couldn't get the books or materials I wanted or needed just because the person next to me doesn't agree with what is being found through researching it	8
6652	3323	I do believe certain things should be seperated from other parts of the libraries	9
6653	3323	For example, books that would be found offensive to children should be kept away from where children can pick out things in a library	10
6654	3323	That is completely understandable	11
6655	3323	But when things are being removed because certain peolpe don't agree with them or find them offensive, that is when things are going too far	12
6656	3323	This nation was built on the grounds of freedom for what you believe in	13
6657	3323	So why should we force others to believe something we think	14
6658	3323	Just because I find something offensive, doesn't mean the person next to me does, which is completely fine with me	15
6659	3323	That is his or her own personal opinion, and what I believe should not keep him or her from learning about the things they would like to	16
6660	3323	One way to fix this problem would be to seperate things that could possibly be found offensive into another section of the library and to put out a sign or paper saying what exactly can be found in that section	17
6661	3323	In conclusion, no, I do not think libraries should be censored	18
6662	3323	I know I could walk into my local library and find things I found offensive right now, but I would not want my own opinion to effect someone else's viewing of that material	19
6663	3323	People should think about one another once in a while and not be so stuck on what they personally believe	20
6664	3323	The world is an opinionated place, if it were not we would have nothing	21
6665	3323	A library can be filled with usful materials, so the focus should be on what you can find in a library to help you, not on what is in the library that you do not want to see	22
6666	3323	If you find something offensive, simply stay away from it, but don't try to take it away from the rest of the world.	23
6667	3324	Libraries should have censorship because young kids could come and open and look at it	0
6668	3324	I think we should have it because it would make sure the kids wont look at them	1
6669	3324	There are three reasons why they should have censorship	2
6670	3324	First they can teach kids bad things, second bad influence, and third they just dont need to be there	3
6671	3324	First was they can teach kids bad thing	4
6672	3324	That is because they would start looking at it more	5
6673	3324	Then they would get in trouble	6
6674	3324	There is really no reason for them to looking at it at all	7
6675	3324	Second, its a bad influence	8
6676	3324	They go and tell and show there friends and make them start doing stuff that isn't right	9
6677	3324	Makeing then do stuff and then have a bad future	10
6678	3324	Third there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it	11
6679	3324	Like unless it fell from a book case and was laying on the floor	12
6680	3324	But there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it	13
6681	3324	I think we should have it so it cant hurt and kids so everyone would be right in life	14
6682	3325	I think that a cencorship in libraries isn't needed	0
6683	3325	The grounds that are basing the cencorship are very opinionated and biased ones	1
6684	3325	Two readers of one book could view the material compleately differently	2
6685	3325	The reader has chosen to read that book, and thus more than likely know what the general plot is before they read the first page because of the summary on the back	3
6686	3325	People can make their own decisions, and can therefor choose wether or not to read the book to begin with	4
6687	3325	The books that would be found innapropriate or offensive would most likely be in teen novels or adult literature	5
6688	3325	If this is the case, they should be mature enough to handle stumbling across the material, and or making the decision to put the book back and to not continue reading	6
6689	3325	Saying that the material is unsuitable for a younger age group is correct, but at that age the children should be with @CAPS1 adult when checking out books anyway	7
6690	3325	The material that people find unacceptable would almost certainly be in a novel that is intended for a mature audience, so if it is being read by a younger age group that would be the problem in and of it's self	8
6691	3325	The teens and or adults whom would be reading such material is surely old enough to handle reading a few foul words and scattered inuendos thoughout the plot	9
6692	3325	The material that @MONTH1 be found innapropriate or offensive @MONTH1 be viewed differently given two different audiences	10
6693	3325	A teen in high school has probably heard worse in the halls durring passing	11
6694	3325	@CAPS1 adult that is worring about what their children read has certainly been exposed to enough thoughout their lifetime to either look past the text or to put it away	12
6695	3325	The material being called offensive just because of one person's views in not rite	13
6696	3325	The tough situations and our surroundings are what prepair us for our futures	14
6697	3325	A person seeing the bad in life would be more likely to do all in their power to make good of their futures and be more willing to help make shure it could be prevented	15
6698	3325	Should the foul things in life be ignored	16
6699	3325	Should the child that is being beaten at home have to suffer in silence because it seems too graphic to tell	17
6700	3325	The man who became homeless, only to turn his life around because he learned from his past, should that story not be told only because the troubles he had to face seem too disturbing	18
6701	3325	I believe that these are the stories that need told the most, in @CAPS1 attempt to teach those around us how to prevent, and how to move past the troubles in life	19
6702	3325	There will always be things that we wish not to see in life	20
6703	3325	But is it not our actions that follow seeing such misfortunes that determine who we are	21
6704	3325	The libraries should not be put on a cencorship, but open to the public that wish to dive in to these stories	22
6705	3325	Books are written for a purpose, and that purpose @MONTH1 just be to let people know that these things are happening, and if one thinks  they are alone in these strifes that they are not	23
6706	3326	I believe that indeed certian books sould not be on libraries shelves	0
6707	3326	And some people @MONTH1 feel the need to remove books of their choosing but, I also say that if the library sees it fit to put such books on their shelves that is their problem	1
6708	3326	I believe that if you do not like the books then stay away from them	2
6709	3326	Now if the books are only meant to be seen by adult eyes then, yes by all means remove them	3
6710	3326	I personally know parents that would not allow their childern to need a book just because in the review they read the main characters kissed	4
6711	3326	I find it rediculous, but that is the way they parent their kids	5
6712	3326	And as long as they dont take it upon themselves to force they parenting methods on to libraries and other learning places just because of the books I am fine with it	6
6713	3326	I find that some people see books on slavery and the holocost and such topics to be offensive	7
6714	3326	I see those books as our history, those topics are taught to us in school and we will most likely hear about such things as we grow up	8
6715	3326	What is the difference between learning about them now and learning about them as a adult	9
6716	3326	People seem to be trying to shield the world from thing like swear words	10
6717	3326	Why	11
6718	3326	If a book has a few curse words oh well, tell your kids to stay away from it if you think its bad	12
6719	3326	But, do not take it upon yourself to remove that book from our library	13
6720	3326	People have different views, we always have and we always will	14
6721	3326	If a parent feels so strongly about a few books get a postition and get signatures saying that these books should be removed or atleast moved to a different part of the library	15
6722	3326	Do not force your thoughts on some one else	16
6723	3327	BOOKSDear @PERSON1,@CAPS1 @CAPS2 staring to tell you about the books in the libraries that some adults find offensive so for the kids	0
6724	3327	These books should be taken away so kids won't read them, second part is adults should protest so the libraries could get does maganzines away or etc, and my last thing is @CAPS4 do libraries get these books and let kids take them so they could read them.The first example @CAPS2 giving is I founded some books and other things that I search being offensive for kids	1
6725	3327	And the libraries letting kids read them without an I.D because they are for adults reading sections	2
6726	3327	These books need to be away so kids won't read offensive things or trying to them	3
6727	3327	They should pbs books so under age children could read and so parents don't have to be worry about there kids what they are reading in there free time.The second example is parents should protest so books or other etc things could be rid of	4
6728	3327	Parents need to protest so any thing they find offensive should get off of the shelve	5
6729	3327	Or another thing is they will have to make a list of what books are offensive and let only adults read them by having an I.D and could sound a little better so books or etc don't get rid of the books.The last example is @CAPS4 do libraries let kids take them home and read them.They should what kids need to read like educational books for school or for other things	6
6730	3327	Adults need to see what there kids read this days	7
6731	3327	Kids need to understand what books are good for them from there age and otherwise their brain will start confusing them at their age.The conclusion is that libraries need to make something up so children don't read these kind of books that the only thing will do is mess up with there brain and then there parents will need to pay so their children could take therapy and others kids so their brain could be better	8
6732	3327	So please libraries do something so parents don't need to worry about what there kids read these days	9
6733	3327	Like for me I won't like my kid read offensive things because they will start doin the same things so libraries do something about these on offensive things.	10
6734	3328	In my opinion I think that censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries.I think that people are smart enough to make their  decisions on what they want to read	0
6735	3328	Their are a few reasons why I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries or out in public	1
6736	3328	The first reason why i think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is becuase it's showing disobedience	2
6737	3328	The second reason I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is because many people will overuse their authority, and it'll make many people have a bad review for that library	3
6738	3328	The last reason why I think censorship should not be allowed in libraries is that it'll change the whole enviroment of a library	4
6739	3328	Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it shows a form of disobedience	5
6740	3328	I think that many people will use profanity and will have an I don't care attitude	6
6741	3328	If people use profanity at home im a strong beleaver on leaving it at home and not bringing it out in public	7
6742	3328	Censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else in my opinion	8
6743	3328	Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because many people will overuse their authority and most people wouldn't want to come back to the library	9
6744	3328	Some people overuse their authority by being loud in the libraries preventing others from reading or during something to occpy themselves	10
6745	3328	If a library is loud and obnoxious it'll drive people away from the library	11
6746	3328	I think that a library should be a nice quiet welcoming	12
6747	3328	That'll make the library much flow by easier	13
6748	3328	At the of the day i think that censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else public	14
6749	3328	A library is a place to go read, study, complete homework assignments etc	15
6750	3328	And finally i think that people should be able to make decisions on their own rather they want to read a book with censorship or anything to do with censorship as long as they can controll it	16
6751	3329	I do belive that certain stuff should be removed from the libraries like stuff that little kids should not be able to see	0
6752	3329	They should be in the other room to where you have to have like a id to get in	1
6753	3329	They should make sure about this cause you dont want your little son looking at like playboy	2
6754	3329	I know i dont	3
6755	3329	Little kids should not be reading books with alot of swearing and evrything cause no kid needs to act like that	4
6756	3329	It bothers them they could get in trouble with school and at home	5
6757	3329	Yes it @MONTH1 be true that adults like to read about sex, and drugs but do we really want our kids reading the same stuff that we read	6
6758	3329	Some people just need to think about what they just leaving out in the librarys because little kids loves to see new stuff all the time	7
6759	3329	So next time you working at the library or just there vistiing you might wanna watch where you put stuff at cause little kids will see it.	8
6760	3330	Eventually, everyone sees or hears offensive things	0
6761	3330	However, the government has taken it upon themselves to try and keep youth from seeing it	1
6762	3330	They believe the parents should tell their children about everything while they try to make it one big secret for kids	2
6763	3330	But, if kids are introduced early, we would not have to keep it a secret anymore	3
6764	3330	Libraries and all types of media should not be censored	4
6765	3330	Kids always ask questions like 'where do babies come from?' and adults, wanting to avoid an awkward conversation, make up stories or do not tell them the whole truth	5
6766	3330	Imagine a world where the government let the media say whatever they want	6
6767	3330	Yes, at first it would be vulgar but the government would then have the right to teach about sex and drugs in school	7
6768	3330	More kids would be educated, so less of them would be curious enough to do any of that stuff	8
6769	3330	That is not to say that newscasters should curse everytime they are on television	9
6770	3330	It is merely suggesting that instead of having a metaphorical black curtain over half the news, they report the whole truth	10
6771	3330	They have freedom of speech, and we have a right to know	11
6772	3330	At first, people would think it was a terrible world	12
6773	3330	But, eventually, with right leadership, it would help make a more truthful environment	13
6774	3330	Kids would learn about sex and drugs in school, and have a safe environment to answer their questions if they have any	14
6775	3330	Drug use and rape would go down	15
6776	3330	Then, talking about 'offensive' topics would be non-existent so kids would not be embarassed if they had questions	16
6777	3330	This would change the world for the better.	17
6778	3331	The library is known to be a place full of dreams and imagination	0
6779	3331	For some, the library is a sanction where you can escape reality and dive into a book where anything is possible	1
6780	3331	the library is full of many books for all ages	2
6781	3331	Therefore, books that are classified for one age group, @MONTH1 not be appropriate for another age group	3
6782	3331	This is where a problem occurs	4
6783	3331	If the library chooses to keep books in it that are only appropriate for certain ages groups, various problems can occur	5
6784	3331	The three main issues with this situation are young children can access magazines they have no buissness looking at, some articles or books can be found offensive to some races creating an uproar, and also events and instances played out in books @MONTH1 not be appropriate for all age groups.We have to think about books we have read, and contemplate if we would want others to read it as well	6
6785	3331	Young children are often daily visitors of the library	7
6786	3331	Most run aroud the library getting into any and all books or magazines the happent to come across	8
6787	3331	This is not always good	9
6788	3331	Int he library there are many magazines that are meant for adult eyes only	10
6789	3331	My family has had an experiance with this sort of situation before	11
6790	3331	My mother , brother, and myself visited the library one evening	12
6791	3331	While my mother and I searched the library chaotically, my younger brother found hisself, searching the magazine rack for something to keep his mind occupied	13
6792	3331	Well his mission was accomplished	14
6793	3331	On his search my younger brother had found himself a sports illustrated magazine	15
6794	3331	Inside there were pictures revealed that my mother was not to happy about my brother seeing	16
6795	3331	Instances like this happy everyday int he local library	17
6796	3331	staff members should think to put revealing works up to where the younger generation can not find them	18
6797	3331	Throughout the library, there are many books dealing with past historic events	19
6798	3331	Although many find these books helpful and interesting, some find these books to be quite offensive.ome races have undergone painful events in history	20
6799	3331	Many of those people do not want to relive the painful past experiances	21
6800	3331	It is in my opinion that the library should oblige by the people, and take in reference how different people feel about certain books	22
6801	3331	When i was a young girl in elementary school, I remember doing a whole unit on slavery and the underground railroad	23
6802	3331	While studing the unit, we were assigned a research assignment over the lesson	24
6803	3331	I choose to visit the library in search for books I could use to gather more information	25
6804	3331	While searching the library, I came across a book that my mother and I felt should not of been where younger people could see	26
6805	3331	the book enclosed many horrible acts against black people	27
6806	3331	This is a book that at my age, I should of never came across	28
6807	3331	For me reading books helps me escape the real world and catch a break	29
6808	3331	When I relax and enjoy a good book, I can't help but feel like nothing inthe world can touch me	30
6809	3331	Although I love reading books, I don't like when I come begin reading a book then have to hault because the book reveals events that I shouldn't be reading	31
6810	3331	One book I read, was definitley not appropriate for me	32
6811	3331	Although I found the book , in the young adult section, the book I read revealed a young girl encoutering many rapes and beatings	33
6812	3331	Now that I look back , that is a book that i might enjoy now, @NUM1 years later, but I don't feel i should have encountered that book then	34
6813	3331	What books should and shouldn't be encountered in the library is surely a never ending feud	35
6814	3331	Many believe that books should be taken out if they are not appropriate for all audiences	36
6815	3331	I think that if the inappropriate books that should not be viewed by all ages, were put away to where the younger audience couldn't get them, then the never ending feud might be able to be put to rest	37
6816	3332	Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
6817	3332	No, I do not believe they should be, but that is my opinion	1
6818	3332	It is pointless to remove them from the shelves because the children are going to see that kind of material outside of school, so why should we remove it	2
6819	3332	Music, movies, magazines, and books all have material such as	3
6820	3332	racism, murders, innopropriate language, etc	4
6821	3332	When we find materials, like those listed before offensive outside of school, we stay away from them	5
6822	3332	We ignore it and watch or read something that we do not find offensive	6
6823	3332	Movies and books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are sometimes found offensive to some people and if we remove them from our libraries then we can not have references for when we right essays over those topics	7
6824	3332	It would be hard to get the right kind of information off the internet because not everything is correct on there	8
6825	3332	One hundred percent of factual books is correct	9
6826	3332	You will have no worries then	10
6827	3332	Therefore, I do not believe that certain materials that are found offensive to some people should be removed	11
6828	3332	It is a pointless task to do	12
6829	3332	Children see it outside of school and stay away from it then so they can stay away from it in school also.	13
6830	3333	Censorship in Libraries      I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed	0
6831	3333	Just because some people think it's offensive doesnt't mean all people think it's offensive	1
6832	3333	Some people @MONTH1 like the content it shows	2
6833	3333	I think that things in a library shouldn't be removed because everyone has their own point of view	3
6834	3333	If something was removed every time someone would walk in, then there would be no library	4
6835	3333	A library is supposed to be a variety of books	5
6836	3333	It is not supposed to be just one genre that only one person likes	6
6837	3333	It is important to offer alot of variety because if a library doesn't have alot of variety, then the library would lose all kinds of customers	7
6838	3333	A library doesn't want to target just kids or teen through aduts	8
6839	3333	The library wants to target all aspects of people	9
6840	3333	Even if it means that some content is innapropriate	10
6841	3333	All books are innapropiate if you look at them in the wrong way	11
6842	3333	I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed	12
6843	3333	Everyone has their own point of view	13
6844	3333	A library should have a variety of books	14
6845	3333	Not just one genre a person wants.	15
6846	3334	Have you ever been in a library and thought to yourself, 'hey, this book looks pretty good.' But once you read @CAPS3, you deamed @CAPS3 as innoproprate for younger people	0
6847	3334	I have, but unlike some people, I don't blame @CAPS3 on the libraries	1
6848	3334	I blame myself for picking @CAPS3 up in the first place	2
6849	3334	Some people do not want to take the responsibility for their actions, and so they blame @CAPS3 on the library for carrying a certain author's books, a band's songs, or a magazine's articles	3
6850	3334	This brings me to say that books, music, magazines, newspapers, etc	4
6851	3334	should not be taken off of the shelves of libraries	5
6852	3334	Just because some people do not like the content that they hold, doesn't mean that @CAPS3 can't be helpful or entertaining to others	6
6853	3334	I think @CAPS3 should be a matter of choice, like choosing which outfit you want to wear in the @TIME1	7
6854	3334	There are  too many options, like when @CAPS3 comes to the books, movies, music, and magazines	8
6855	3334	If something strikes you as innoproprate, then simply take @CAPS3 back and exchange @CAPS3 for something better	9
6856	3334	One experience I can think of that is a good example of this is when I was @NUM1 years old	10
6857	3334	My mother took me into the library and I found a book, 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3.' I showed @CAPS3 to her just like any other time we had gone to the library	11
6858	3334	Only this time, she did not want me to check @CAPS3 out	12
6859	3334	She saw @CAPS3 as too harsh of a book for me to read at the time, she wanted me to wait untill I was older	13
6860	3334	@CAPS3 was about @CAPS1 abuse and she saw @CAPS3 as a very innoproprate book for my age, at the time	14
6861	3334	But she didn't blame @CAPS3 on the libraries, asking why they would carry such books where children could reach them	15
6862	3334	Other mothers and fathers are the same way, as I found out	16
6863	3334	My best friend's parents had been the same way with her	17
6864	3334	Only instead of a book, @CAPS3 was a music cd that she had wanted to listen to	18
6865	3334	They thought that she should not listen to @CAPS3 because the lyrics in the songs were too 'sad' for her to hear	19
6866	3334	They agreed that if she were just a little older then she could of borrowed @CAPS3	20
6867	3334	They did not blame the library	21
6868	3334	If someone else wanted to listen to @CAPS3, or have their childen listen to @CAPS3, then @CAPS3 was their own personal choice	22
6869	3334	I do not belive that libraries should have censorships	23
6870	3334	They can have different sections, such as adult, children, and young adult	24
6871	3334	But I believe that they should not have to take books, music, magazines, etc	25
6872	3334	off the shelves just because of certain people	26
6873	3334	@CAPS3 should be a person's personal choice	27
6874	3334	If they do not like the item that they picked up, they should take responsibility for their actions, and not blame others for their mistakes.	28
6875	3335	I think books, movies, music, and magazines that are offensive should not be pulled from the shelfs	0
6876	3335	If you find something offensive then dont pick it up, its that simple	1
6877	3335	You @MONTH1 find something offensive but it might not be to someone else	2
6878	3335	It is all according to you own personal opinion	3
6879	3335	Sure, there are somethings that are very offensive to certain people, and those people will try to put a stop to it	4
6880	3335	But I think that is wrong	5
6881	3335	Because it @MONTH1 be offensive to you but what if there is somone studying that topic but cant find the information on it because you thought it was offensive and got it pulled off of the shelf	6
6882	3335	Then it disrupts that persons study	7
6883	3335	I am not promoting violent books and movies or other offensive material, all im saying if you find something offensive then turn the other cheek	8
6884	3335	It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but other people @MONTH1 not think the same way	9
6885	3335	There are many books and movies out there that are offensive to many people	10
6886	3335	And if we were to take all of those movies and books off of the shelf then there would be very few subjects and title to read and watch	11
6887	3335	In my conclusion, I support the fact that offensive material should stay on the shelfs	12
6888	3335	It could be helpful to many people and at the same time it can be offensive to alot of people	13
6889	3335	But if you are one of those people that find something offensive then dont pay any attention to it and find another subject or topic	14
6890	3335	For someone to take another persons right to read a book or watch a movie is wrong everyone has their own opinions and rights	15
6891	3337	Katherine Paterson, a well-known author, presents an idea with which I strongly agree	0
6892	3337	She states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	1
6893	3337	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	2
6894	3337	And then we have no books left on the shelf left for any of us.'  If everyone has the right to remove certain books that they find inappropriate, there @MONTH1 not be anything left for people to read	3
6895	3337	Although it is a good thing for parents to have a voice and stand up for what they believe, books should not be banned	4
6896	3337	Many people have different views on what is right and wrong	5
6897	3337	Some @MONTH1 suggest that a certain book is obscene, while others @MONTH1 be offended by a different book	6
6898	3337	If every parent had the right to get a book banned, there @MONTH1 come a time when no books meet the approval of the parent	7
6899	3337	Some of these books present great learning opportunities to students	8
6900	3337	Books often allow students to think in different, new ways	9
6901	3337	They can learn from a new point of view	10
6902	3337	Often times, a student can look at his or her own morals and values, which is a good thing	11
6903	3337	If a teacher finds a book which they think is appropriate, parents should respect the decision of this teacher	12
6904	3337	They @MONTH1 suggest another reading, or offer other ideas, but to go as far as getting the book completely removed is not right	13
6905	3337	While removing books for reading @MONTH1 be going to far, things such as movies could go the other direction	14
6906	3337	Personally, my parents would be horrified to see grotesque, inappropriate movies set out in broad daylight where everyone can look at them	15
6907	3337	I think that this difference between books and movies is a simple thing: Books do not normally have an inappropriate cover, while bad movies often do	16
6908	3337	Because of this, even the people who do not wish to view the movie are often forced to see images which they find disturbing	17
6909	3337	If one was to walk past a book they did not intend to read, they do not have to be apalled at the cover as they pass	18
6910	3337	Although parents care about the things their children read, books should not be banned	19
6911	3337	Although other things @MONTH1 have affects on youth, books are a different story	20
6912	3337	They allow one's self to dive deep into thought, to make observations, and to form opinions	21
6913	3337	They are a key to growing, learning, and discovering.	22
6914	3338	First off, I do like censorship laws to an extent	0
6915	3338	However, the government cannot ban everything that they deem innapropriate	1
6916	3338	I think it depends more on what the family deems innapropiate	2
6917	3338	I do not think they should have any completely inaccessible areas in libraries for children of younger ages	3
6918	3338	I believe that the viewer should have a family member's consent to view said content	4
6919	3338	I also believe that if the content is not relative to the viewers interests, then they should just not look at it	5
6920	3338	They are not required to look at it so if they do not like it, then they do not look at it	6
6921	3338	However, if the library does not consent to holding the books, music, movies, magaines, etc., then they do not have to and the viewer can go somewhere else	7
6922	3338	And if they do have the books, music, etc., then they can put limits and ratings on them	8
6923	3338	But I do not think that an adult could go in and complain about innapropriate material	9
6924	3338	As I said before, if they do not like it, then they are not required to look at it	10
6925	3338	I actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials	11
6926	3338	One parent should not have the ability to take away others' privilages to books, because they deem it innapropriate	12
6927	3338	Just because they do not like the content, does not exclude all others from enjoying it	13
6928	3338	Also, if a library does have an age restriction on certain materials, then appropriate acts of discipline should be taken for the viewer of said materials	14
6929	3338	However, if the viewer has an adult family member with them and has their consent, then I think they should be able to view the material, regardless of ratings.	15
6930	3339	There are so many books and magazines, music, and movies to be discovered in this world	0
6931	3339	Some are funny, sad, wierd, scary, etc	1
6932	3339	And then there are some that are questionable to others on wheather it was even nessecary to even put the the material on the shelf of a library in the first place	2
6933	3339	I for one am not one of those people who would question a book, magazine, movie or music	3
6934	3339	I believe that everyone's voice needs to be heard somehow and if we all take a voice away that we do not like, then we will lose a lot of voices	4
6935	3339	We are all entitled to our own opinion	5
6936	3339	When it comes to some things some are more opinionated than other, but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about	6
6937	3339	There are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel	7
6938	3339	If we take that away from people, then how will we all connect	8
6939	3339	Some things @MONTH1 come across as offensive to others, but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world	9
6940	3339	I have observed that when people have the same interests in things like music, books, or movies then it gives people a way to come together and talk about something	10
6941	3339	I have witnessed at concerts everybody seems to connect because we are all there for the same reason, to see the band or person that we all like to listen to	11
6942	3339	Everybodys different and likes to have their own personal preference on something	12
6943	3339	Like Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	13
6944	3339	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think she was trying to say that if we all take a book off the shelf that we do not think should be on there, then there is going to be nothing left for anybody to read	14
6945	3339	Then what will we do	15
6946	3339	Theres such a variety of materials that are needed to be discovered wheather it is a book, music, or movie everyone has their own special type that they enjoy	16
6947	3339	I do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf	17
6948	3339	Theses materials are what keep people connected with each other	18
6949	3339	I think it is very important to not censor anything because it does not just give the writer a voice, it give a voice for the people that agree with the material of the book, movie, or music	19
6950	3340	There are many books, movies, and music in the libraries	0
6951	3340	These things can come in so many varities	1
6952	3340	Have you ever been to a library and not found something you liked	2
6953	3340	Well most people find a  lot of things that intrest them in many ways	3
6954	3340	Many people come to a library a day to check out something they will enjoy and have a good time listing, reading, or watching	4
6955	3340	So many people are diferent and each person likes something diferent from one another	5
6956	3340	So the question is, 'Should we remove some books, music, and movies off the shelfs because they're offensive?'     From experince, yes there are things at a library that children or younger teenagers should not read, hear, or see	6
6957	3340	Though that most libraries split a lot of there sections up by ages	7
6958	3340	Depending on your age you should go to the sections that mostly provides the thing you want	8
6959	3340	Do not go to a place that provides something that is not your age group, instead go to the place that looks like you belong	9
6960	3340	I personally have seen younger teens or children get a book or magaizine that was not there age group, but @CAPS1 that children wanted to look up on that thing	10
6961	3340	You have to understand that most younger teens and children are curious about many things before they even get to that age	11
6962	3340	As a  parent or legal gardian, most children look up to you	12
6963	3340	@CAPS1 you read, listin, or watch something that is not to there age level, but the child wants to be just like you	13
6964	3340	Children look up to there parents or legal gardian	14
6965	3340	They want to @CAPS1 do the same thing you do, so they copy you	15
6966	3340	They will find soemthing that is similar to what you doing	16
6967	3340	They might go find a book, movie, or cd that is not there age group	17
6968	3340	They will do this all because @CAPS1 they want to be just like there parents or gardian	18
6969	3340	So as a parent or gardian you have to watch what you do also and try to set good examples to you children so they do not find offensive books or ect.	19
6970	3340	There are so many reason why people might think some things are offensive	20
6971	3340	Even though we are the reason why books and other things are brought into libraries today	21
6972	3340	Children today are growing up a lot faster then we want them to, but sometimes we can not stop that	22
6973	3340	Just set good examples to children or any person not to get a book, movie, or music that is not there age group	23
6974	3340	Libraries can be a fun and learning enviroment for everyone	24
6975	3340	Just sometimes we all do not think a like or like the same stuff	25
6976	3340	There are just to many people in this world and I have read articles about libraries	26
6977	3340	I have read why libraries might not be a family place anymore all because of the varities they carry	27
6978	3340	Have you ever thought though, '@CAPS1 its use humans that makes the libraries carry these varities?' I think so, because we are what makes up a library	28
6979	3340	We the people are the ones that want these books, movies, magazines, and music	29
6980	3340	So think about it next time you walk into a library and you see something that you @CAPS1 not think is right	30
6981	3340	Think about how @CAPS1 someone @CAPS1 really likes that	31
6982	3340	We all need to except things if we like it or not at times	32
6983	3340	Just set good examples to help people not get those things that could be offensive	33
6984	3341	Libraries should have whatever they want in the library	0
6985	3341	Everyone has their on thoughts on things	1
6986	3341	If you don't like what they have on there shelfs then don't go there any more or pick up something you like	2
6987	3341	Everyone is different so you can't just take offensive stuff off the shelves, it might be offensive to one person, but not to someone else	3
6988	3341	Materials, such as book, music, movies, magazines you can't just start taking stuff of the shelves just because there offensived you	4
6989	3341	The only way I would say take books or magazines off the shelves is if the facts are not right	5
6990	3341	Libraries hold almost anything anybody needs materials, books, music, movies, magazines and everythings for facts	6
6991	3341	So don't start taking stuff off your shelves	7
6992	3341	Teenagers might have to write a paper about something that people think is affensive, if you don't have everything in the library then we won't have good facts	8
6993	3341	No one in this world agrees on anything, all you would be doing would be picking a fight if you taking of offensive.Libraries are open to any one that wants to read about almost anything they want to read about	9
6994	3341	Music everybody has there on type of music you can't just start taking music of because you think it's offensive	10
6995	3341	Most people have there own type of everything	11
6996	3341	Children is there own person you can keep them from whatever you want to, the thing is you can't hold them back in life	12
6997	3341	They get older you won't be able to tell them want to do or want not to do	13
6998	3341	If you keep them from a book or etc they might end up reading it in the long run	14
6999	3341	Keep you kids safe is inpormant I understand your kids are going to expirects things you don't want them to	15
7000	3341	Just by taking offensive stuff of the shelves doesn't mean your kids won't fine them some where else	16
7001	3341	I could understand if the books or magazines were offensive to you because it was about your family, But of time your going to have offensive come up in your life	17
7002	3341	That means your going to have to not let it get under you skin or get over it	18
7003	3341	Things get under people skin to easy	19
7004	3341	This is why the world don't get along	20
7005	3341	If you don't like something don't me around it	21
7006	3341	Fine something unless to read about	22
7007	3341	Thats what I do if I don't like something.	23
7008	3342	Libraries provide us with knowledge, entertainment, and peace	0
7009	3342	You can go there to learn and to do research if you have to write a paper	1
7010	3342	You can rent movies, music, and books at your pleasure as long as you take care of them	2
7011	3342	Also, if you're just having a hectic day and need some peace and quiet, libraries become a perfect get away	3
7012	3342	But, heres the truth	4
7013	3342	Many people find certain things in libraries to be offensive and would rather them not be on the shevles	5
7014	3342	So, do we remove these things or let them stay	6
7015	3342	My opinion is to let them stay	7
7016	3342	I believe that books are too important to throw out just because they @MONTH1 contain a few vulgar words or images	8
7017	3342	It's the same with magazines and movies	9
7018	3342	Also, music is changing as the years go on and many people, especially elders, don't enjoy listening to this new style of music	10
7019	3342	Just because one person my find something offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will	11
7020	3342	People have many different views when it comes to these things	12
7021	3342	Take history for example	13
7022	3342	Many history books contain harsh, real life facts about things that went on in the past	14
7023	3342	A song, book, or movie about slavery can cause some people to be offended	15
7024	3342	Whether it's because the person opposes slavery greatly or they believe that slavery was a good thing, people have different feelings towards it	16
7025	3342	Another good example is movies	17
7026	3342	Some people @MONTH1 find a movie offensive because of words said or if a certain person dies first, while others could care less	18
7027	3342	Additionally, many things that are found offensive to one person can make something more interesting to someone else	19
7028	3342	There are many movies nowdays that can be seen as very offensive	20
7029	3342	But honestly, the offensive things happening @MONTH1 just make someone else want to know more about what's going on	21
7030	3342	It is practically the same with books	22
7031	3342	I myself have read plenty of things that would make some people cry or even get really mad or disgusted	23
7032	3342	Even though in the end, I lfind them to be exceptionally books	24
7033	3342	It just on how you view it	25
7034	3342	So, should things that are found offensive to one person be removed from a library	26
7035	3342	The answer is no	27
7036	3342	There are just too many things that can be taken offensively	28
7037	3342	If you start taking away these things, libraries are only going to become vacant	29
7038	3342	Younger people will stop coming because materials will be less interesting	30
7039	3342	You will lose artifacts and stories about the history of the world	31
7040	3342	There will also only be so many books to read, if ever a non-offensive book could even be found	32
7041	3342	My advise to libraries, keep materials that can be found extremely offensive in their own area, away from younger people who @MONTH1 react strongly	33
7042	3342	Maybe even put a sticker on the book, if possible, letting people know just what they're dealing with	34
7043	3343	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
7044	3343	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I adhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
7045	3343	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe that the books and other items should stay in the shelves of the library that censorship in libriaries is unnecessary	2
7046	3343	As Katherine Paterson stated there will be no books left on the shelves if you take every book off that someone in the @CAPS1  finds offensive	3
7047	3343	What is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be considered offensive in another persons point of view	4
7048	3343	Children, teens, and adults have their own right to choose whatever book they want to read, movie they want to watch , or music they want to listen to	5
7049	3343	If it is a child or a young teen then I believe that the parents should have a say in what their children read or watch	6
7050	3343	In my case I am not allowed to listen to offensive music or watch rated @CAPS2 movies but that shouldn't mean that it should be taken off the shelves of the library	7
7051	3343	Just because that is what my family believes to be right does not mean it is the only wat to live	8
7052	3343	A person has their own rights to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to	9
7053	3343	They can make the choice by the way they have been raised or just because that is what they think is right or wrong	10
7054	3343	If they think that a book is offensive then they don't have to read it, they have the right to say no and put the book back on the self	11
7055	3343	If they think that the book is approriate then they can read it and there is no law stating that they have to share the book with anyone else	12
7056	3343	If there is a book out there that is offensive in your view and you read it there is no reason you have to agree with it	13
7057	3343	Every person is free to disagree with anything they want to disagree with	14
7058	3343	If you are a parent to a child and you are uncomfortable with them reading, listening, or watching something that is offensive you should set the rules early in life with them	15
7059	3343	Parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching @NUM1 or rated @CAPS2 movies	16
7060	3343	Therefore, if you are comfortable with your children seeing and hearing offensive things then you don't have to worry about what is out there in the @CAPS1.The things that your children are watching, reading, listening to isn't a problem and if it becomes a problem in the parents eyes then they have the right to stop the children from reading the offensive books or watching the bad movies and listening to the music that the view as offensive	17
7061	3343	Every parent and family is different, as long as your child knows the rules and what you believe in then there is no need for censorship in libraries	18
7062	3343	In my family I am not allowed to listen to offensive music	19
7063	3343	Offensive music in my house is considered music with curse words in the lyrics	20
7064	3343	The words that my family considers offensive @MONTH1 be different then what other families consider offensive	21
7065	3343	I know that I don't want to and can't listen to those certain songs but that does not mean that I can't be friends or be around people that listen to that kind of music	22
7066	3343	Just because that is what my family believes in does not mean that it should be taken of the shelves of the library or any other place	23
7067	3343	What my family believes in @MONTH1 not be the right thing in another familys view	24
7068	3343	Every person has their own right and if they want to listen to that music then they should be able to	25
7069	3343	My family also believes that at my age right now I should not watch rated @CAPS2 movies	26
7070	3343	If you took all the rated @CAPS2 movies off the shelves, then half the movies would be gone and that is not fair to the people who enjoy rated @CAPS2 movies	27
7071	3343	What my family believes @MONTH1 not be what other families believe in	28
7072	3343	I know what I stand for and I will do what I think is right and I won't listen to offenesive music or watch rated @CAPS2 movies	29
7073	3343	In no way though does that mean that other children, teens, adults shouldn't enjoy that kind of music and those movies	30
7074	3343	In conclusion, I believe that censorship should not be used in libraries	31
7075	3343	It is every persons own right and they are capable on making decisions that they think are the right thing to do	32
7076	3343	Parents also have a say in what they want their children to watch, read, or listen to	33
7077	3343	They can montor what their children are reading, watching, or listening to and if they find it offensive they can stop their children	34
7078	3343	It is not necessary to take the items off the shelf	35
7079	3343	In my family, my parents find some types of music and movies offensive and I know when I go to the library or any other place that I won't get those items	36
7080	3343	I will get the music and movies I enjoy and find age appropriate	37
7081	3343	Just as in @PERSON2's quote everyone has the same rights and if we all take the items we think are offensive off the shelves, then there will be nothing left on the shelves	38
7082	3343	Everyone has a different point of view and no one person has the correct or wrong point of view that the @CAPS1 has to follow	39
7083	3344	Offensive media is everywhere	0
7084	3344	From books to music lyrics, our culture embraces us with it	1
7085	3344	Children that see inappropriate media can pick up bad behavior	2
7086	3344	This can then lead to a child having a hard time associating with his peers	3
7087	3344	Adults are also affected by inappropriate media if they see their favorite celebrity or  any other role model use inappropriate behavior	4
7088	3344	This could make an adult emotionally unhealthy and they @MONTH1 become violent or depressed	5
7089	3344	Finally, our world could be better if offensive media were abolished altogether	6
7090	3344	People's lives could be enriched with good, clean entertainment instead of being corrupted with inappropriate media	7
7091	3344	One can clearly see that offensive media must be pulled from our country's libraries immediatley	8
7092	3344	Inappropriate media is surrounding us daily, including children	9
7093	3344	What children see they imitate, even in the first couple years of their lives	10
7094	3344	So if they hear a swear word on t.v or see someone doing drugs, they @MONTH1 imitate it	11
7095	3344	Clearly this is inappropriate behavior for a child	12
7096	3344	If the child is exposed to inappropriate media, for a long period of time, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to use it in everyday life	13
7097	3344	Their social skills and mind is being corrupted because of offensive media	14
7098	3344	Libraries should pull inappropriate media off of their shelves because it can corrupt a child's mind	15
7099	3344	Another reason why  libraries should pull off offensive media is because adults can pick up different offensive habits as well	16
7100	3344	Just as children can pick up the offensive habit of swearing , so can adults if they are exposed to it for a long period of time	17
7101	3344	Besides swearing, adults can also think that killing someone is ok because they saw it in a movie	18
7102	3344	They could then pick up a violent weapon and try to kill someone if they are angry	19
7103	3344	This is not a healthy way to express your feelings towards someone if they are making you angry	20
7104	3344	Our country's libraries should pull off inappropriate media from their shelves because it can turn adults into being emotionally unhealthy	21
7105	3344	Finally , inappropriate media should be pulled off library shelves because our world could be a better place without it	22
7106	3344	Media is one of the root causes of why people act the way they do	23
7107	3344	If they see their favorite celebrity getting arrested for a @CAPS1  in a magazine, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to drink and drive	24
7108	3344	Another example is if people read about someone doing drugs in a book, they @MONTH1 want to try and experiment with drugs  themselves	25
7109	3344	This can lead to people doing crazy things that can be harmful to other lives around them	26
7110	3344	Offensive media is almost anywhere	27
7111	3344	When children see inappropriate media , they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to imitate it	28
7112	3344	Adults, when exposed to enough offensive media, can pick up nasty habits like swearing, killing or doing drugs which , inturn , can lead to to being emotionally unhealthy	29
7113	3344	With out inappropriate media on our library shelves, our world would be a better place	30
7114	3344	We would have less conflict, less deaths ,and better lives that are enriched, not corrupted , with quality media	31
7115	3344	Millions of lives could be made better if libraries pulled off inappropriate media from their shelves	32
7116	3345	All of us have rights, all of us have the same chance to express what we feel, think or believe	0
7117	3345	Freedom is the most beautiful and important thing we have and nobody can take that away from us: its just something that belongs to ourselves and that everybody does have	1
7118	3345	As humans it is not easy to understand othe people's thoughts and it could turn kinda of hard to accept the opinions that extrangers from us can apport	2
7119	3345	A library is a place where we can find all kind of material that can easily answer many or our questions, sometimes some material can be offensive and make a target of people feel unconfortable as well as there is material that can be really helpful through our searching	3
7120	3345	If i had the right to remove any magazine, book or movie off the shelf, i would at least think about it before remove it and consider how helpful and worth it it could be for someone that really needs it, and if everybody else had the same right as me, the we wouldn't have any material at all in the library	4
7121	3345	Music is a big topic to talk about, we all know there are people that are really used to listen to a type of music that other people can call it as 'rude music' and i could be pretty much offensive for kids	5
7122	3345	I trully believe it wont be fear for any of us to labeled people because of the music they like, the books they read or the movies they watch	6
7123	3345	We need to understand nobody is better than nobody and we also need to respect other people's feelings, its something that we have to work on.	7
7124	3347	Censorship in the world is getting worse everyday	0
7125	3347	Many people believe that some material is unsuitable	1
7126	3347	I believe that if it is unsuitable for others does not make it unsuitable for some	2
7127	3347	I believe people have the right to read,watch, or listen to what they want as long as it is not breaking any laws	3
7128	3347	I am torn on this topic because I am against censorship, but I am also for it when laws are being broken	4
7129	3347	I believe that people should have the right to read whatever they want	5
7130	3347	Granted, some people read very incriminating books that could get them in a lot of trouble, but not everyone should be punished for another persons mistake	6
7131	3347	Sometimes you hear about terrorist groups and other illegal groups, but usually they do not market to everyday people	7
7132	3347	I think that when it becomes a threat to the @LOCATION1 they should remove material	8
7133	3347	Another simple fact is that the constitution @LOCATION1 that we have the freedom of @CAPS1, which basically means we @MONTH1 print and read whatever we want	9
7134	3347	Many people depend on the constitution to make their lives seem safer and sometimes there is a book,article, movie, or a song that goes beyond our limits	10
7135	3347	I believe that some people use materials wrongly sometimes to get ahead and to make a name for themselves	11
7136	3347	I just think that people should write for the pure joy of it, not to persuade people to do something bad,or give bad thoughts or ideas	12
7137	3347	The government has the right to control what we partake in, but does that seem fair	13
7138	3347	I understand thier logic behind this matter, but just because it has offensive matter does not mean they should remove it from society	14
7139	3347	I believe that if people want to experience it they should be able to without wondering if it will gone the next day	15
7140	3347	If people do not agree with this 'offensive' matter, then they should not take part in it	16
7141	3347	This is a true enough statement that it just makes you wonder about their logic	17
7142	3347	So, does the government have the right to say what we can and cannot read	18
7143	3347	I don't believe so, but that is my opinion	19
7144	3347	I believe that people should read whatever they so choose to and should not think they are breaking laws for some 'offensive' material	20
7145	3347	Freedom of the @CAPS1 is what people have to look up to for the government, but how are people supposed to feel secure when they are reading a book, watching a movie, or listening to music that @MONTH1 be assumed 'offensive'.	21
7146	3348	Have you ever found books, movies, music, and magazines that are about drugs, sexuality, and violence	0
7147	3348	I think that books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they have anything to do with drugs, sesuality, and violence	1
7148	3348	There are many reasons why I think that those books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries	2
7149	3348	One reason is because little kids can get ahold of the book, the kind of music, the movie, and the kind of magazine that contains drugs, sexuality, and violence then they can learn how to do those kinds of things	3
7150	3348	A second reason why I think that they should be removed from the shelves of libraries is because I feel like a library is not a place to have those kinds of books, magazines, that kind of music, or that kind of movies for parents and their kids to read about and to watch, or even to listen to music that contains drugs, sexuality, and violence	4
7151	3348	The third reason why I believe that they should be removed form the shelves of libraries is because thoes kinds of materials belong in another building, a building that is far away form children and only certain people can get into the building and look at the books, magazines, watch the movies, and listen to music that contians that kind of stuff	5
7152	3348	The last reason why I believe that they should be removed is because from experience, one time I found a book about drugs I looked at it but it was very unappropate for little kids to look at, it had pictures of what drugs look like, what certain durgs can do to the body	6
7153	3348	In conclusin I hope who ever is reading this that you realize what these books, moveis, music, and magazines are doing to the people that are reading them, watching them, and listening to them	7
7154	3349	There are tons of books in the library that people @MONTH1 find offensive to young readers today	0
7155	3349	I think that these materials should not be removed from the shelves	1
7156	3349	People have a right to read what they choose to read	2
7157	3349	There are many reasons why I think these materials shouldn't be removed from the library	3
7158	3349	First of all, there are so many books that could be found as 'offensive.' @CAPS1 removing all of these offending books, you would basically be removing half the books in the library	4
7159	3349	Most young adult books have something to do with teens, drugs, violence, and other things that would come off as offensive	5
7160	3349	These books are usually the ones that teenagers read	6
7161	3349	Just because they're reading them doesn't mean their actions will be affected	7
7162	3349	These types of books are read for the purpose of entertainment and not meant to harm or offend anybody	8
7163	3349	Secondly, I think that people have a right to choose what they want to read, listen to, and watch	9
7164	3349	Books, music, movies, and magazines are sold for this purpose	10
7165	3349	Everyone has a different opinion and taste to what they like or dislike	11
7166	3349	Finally, I think that censoring what is put on the shelves would be a mistake	12
7167	3349	There are tons of great books or movies that could be found offensive and to take them off the shelf would make them less known	13
7168	3349	Children wouldn't know about them, and they could be missing out on some great stories	14
7169	3349	Everyone has an opinion, and watching out for your children is understandable	15
7170	3349	Censoring what is available at the library would make finding books harder for other people	16
7171	3349	Libraries are meant to have different types of material because everyone has a different taste.	17
7172	3350	I don't think that they should be removed from the shelfs	0
7173	3350	Everyone has a right to read it at some point in time	1
7174	3350	To were no little kids can rent the book	2
7175	3350	If they are complaining about how it's volgar or sexual	3
7176	3350	Then you shouldn't take it away	4
7177	3350	Try something else such as an adult section	5
7178	3350	One person @MONTH1 love a book that has some violence in it and on the other hand you @MONTH1 have a person who is real religous and can't stand to see it	6
7179	3350	There are very many view points of this topic	7
7180	3350	The parents who don't want their kids to be exposed to this type of life style	8
7181	3350	Some people don't really think about it being as bad as the next person	9
7182	3350	If it's a book you dislike on a book shelf and you don't like it put out in plain sight	10
7183	3350	Should you really be the one to make the decision on who takes it down	11
7184	3350	Some people don't know what their kids like to read	12
7185	3350	If they have the final thought on what gets taken down it @MONTH1 affect the kids reading habbits	13
7186	3350	What if your kid wants to read a horror book and you choose not to let those kinds of books on the shelf any more	14
7187	3350	Then they don't want to read the books that are left up on the shelf	15
7188	3350	I'd rather read a book that interests me than a book that I dislike	16
7189	3350	My point of view on this topic is simple	17
7190	3350	I don't think the parents should be in controle of what we read as long as it's appropriate	18
7191	3350	I think the decision should be left for the government to say which book should and shouldn't be taken away.	19
7192	3351	When it comes to censorship I believe that very few things should be removed	0
7193	3351	Just because it is found offensive by some does not mean it is offensive to all	1
7194	3351	A material should only be removed if and only if that material offends an over ruling majority of people	2
7195	3351	If you find it offensive just ignore it you don't have to buy it	3
7196	3351	Maybe somebody else finds it interesting and it comtains the information that they have been seeking	4
7197	3351	When it comes to books, music, movies or magazines I believe almost anything should be allowed except for material that depicts nudity or drugs and alcohol	5
7198	3351	Other than that a little cursing here and there and some violence is perfectly acceptable, but it should probably be kept from small children if it's to bad	6
7199	3351	Usually if a child is exposed to that type of material they usually grow up believing that whatever they saw as a child is completly acceptable	7
7200	3351	Sometimes it's violence sometimes it's other things like drugs or alcohol, whatever the case @MONTH1 be	8
7201	3351	Many parents believe that certain material should be banned because it exposes their child to bad morals	9
7202	3351	But my belief is that if your a good parent then shouldn't have to worry about that type of stuff	10
7203	3351	If you really do not want your child to be of any part of it then take actions to do such	11
7204	3351	For example if you don't want your child watching a certain television show then block it	12
7205	3351	Don't just think they won't watch it and then when they do you get mad at the people who created the show	13
7206	3351	It's not their fault maybe you as a parent should have made sure in the first place that your child did not see that material	14
7207	3351	There are some people out there that believe that if any material depicts anything bad then it should be removed	15
7208	3351	But what I believe is that this is @LOCATION1 and people can read and write whatever they want, and if you have something to say about it then that's fine by me you can believe whatever you would like to believe	16
7209	3351	People should be able to keep their freedom of speech and be creative without being ridiculed by people	17
7210	3354	I dont believe that it should matter what books are in a library	0
7211	3354	If you think a book would be offensive to you, dont read it	1
7212	3354	If you were to read a book with opinions about a cirtian race or religion, just keep your opinion to yourself	2
7213	3354	Most people make a big deal about cirtian things to get attention	3
7214	3354	If a library was split up into sections about topics and such, it would help a lot, and it would be a quicker way to get your books and get out to make room for others	4
7215	3354	I honestly have not seen a @CAPS1 in a school library, but its probly because I did not spend much time lookin for it	5
7216	3354	And if there isnt one, its probly because someone complained about it	6
7217	3354	If you are religious, you should have the right to be able to read what you want	7
7218	3354	Theres all kinds of weird books in the library, and a lot of people just look at them for the fun of it	8
7219	3354	I dont know why some people have so many problems with certian things	9
7220	3354	Like I said before, if you dont like it, dont read it	10
7221	3355	I don't believe any of those materials are offensive if found in a library	0
7222	3355	But if the childrens look somewhere else to find those things then they will find them anytime	1
7223	3355	The offensive materials are out there to be pick up by some people including children	2
7224	3355	The books aren't offensive only if found in the adult area	3
7225	3355	If so found there the children would'nt read it because it's too long for them and the book doesn't have any pictures in the book	4
7226	3355	Music is offensive but like I said only found in the adult area	5
7227	3355	Kids aren' interesting in music at that ageso they would'nt bother to see them	6
7228	3355	Movies and Magazines have offensive things in it and can be found any where, but found in a library is gonna be rare	7
7229	3355	The only thing you will find in a library that is offensive is gonna be a magazine.they make a bunch of different type of them, and can be found anywhere	8
7230	3355	To explain the offensive, and the none offensive books that are out there	9
7231	3355	I'm gonna talk about '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 book has a lot of bad words, sexual scenes, drugs, gang violence, racism	10
7232	3355	@CAPS3 book is so offensive that the childrens parents would'nt let them read it, but @CAPS3 book is based on a true story	11
7233	3355	Everything that happened in that book was real, and people need to know what happened and why were the people in that story doing those things	12
7234	3355	Some books @MONTH1 be offensive but you can learn from others mistake by reading that book	13
7235	3355	Everything @MONTH1 be offensive to you in one way, but looking from the other point of view it's a learning experience	14
7236	3355	People that made those mistake could tell the childrens that those stuff aren't wroth it	15
7237	3355	Everything has it's purpose	16
7238	3355	The books can tell you the story of peoples life, and the movies are based from the story and instead you can watch it	17
7239	3355	Music can tell you the life of people by poetry	18
7240	3355	Magazines really dont have a point their just there to gossip	19
7241	3356	Is the censorship in libraries really necessary	0
7242	3356	In my opinion it is but only to a certain extent	1
7243	3356	I believe that most people who frenquently go to the library know what types of books, movies, magazines, etc	2
7244	3356	that are for more of the adult group and more of the teenage/children group	3
7245	3356	I think the censoring is helping to keep our youth from taking the words and actions and using them in there daily lives	4
7246	3356	If we @CAPS9't want them to read or to even hear them I think the censorship is a great thing in ways	5
7247	3356	I believe if the censorship was to go away in some forms, I would use a different method of a censorship that was a bit more on the more favored sides for adults	6
7248	3356	The censorship would still be at the library in a certain form	7
7249	3356	There would be something just a bit different or new about whatever that person is checking out	8
7250	3356	If we could, when people are checking out these books, movie, magazines, etc	9
7251	3356	we could use a rating just like movies do	10
7252	3356	When a child whom is @NUM1 comes to the library to check out an item and they find one they are interested in they could bring it to the librarian and the librarian would check the rating and the age of the child with there library card and see if that item is appropriate for that child	11
7253	3356	There could be many ratings @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @NUM2, and @CAPS3	12
7254	3356	I think ages @NUM3 are for the @CAPS1-@CAPS2, the ages @NUM4 are for the @NUM2 and ages @NUM6 and up for rated @CAPS3	13
7255	3356	I see many times when children are learning words, phrases, and actions from movies, books, etc	14
7256	3356	that make them think it is ok to do or say these things	15
7257	3356	I think not	16
7258	3356	In my opinion I think that this idea could help out our youth and there parents make better choices in the content they are submitting themselves to	17
7259	3356	So if you feel like this is a good idea contact your local library and tell them you are in favor of the @CAPS7,  '@CAPS7 @CAPS8.' @CAPS9't wait until you have forgotten, call now.	18
7260	3357	Books, movies, music, and even @CAPS1 are all important in this life, and enviorment of ours	0
7261	3357	They all have a learning process	1
7262	3357	When you read you learn, when you watch a movie you learn, even when you listen to music you can learn	2
7263	3357	Weather its about past present or future, everyone has the right to learn it's part of being a citizen	3
7264	3357	Speaking of all this I belive just beacuse one book, or one movie makes someone uncomfortable i dont think that you should take that away	4
7265	3357	Thats not only taking away from your kid, or yourself thats taking away from everyone else	5
7266	3357	Just like the book huckleberry fin it's a wonderful book i love it because it's about the old days where they still belived in slavery, and there were still some good-hearted people around	6
7267	3357	This book to some would be very offensive beacuse of the fact it has the word nigger in it one-hundered and twenty-seven times	7
7268	3357	In fact last year at my school a mother tried to get it taken out, because she didnt want her son to read it he was actually a mixed boy but thankfully the committee saved it and it's still here	8
7269	3357	That's our history and everyone needs to learn some of it, weather it's offensive or not	9
7270	3357	As well as movies that can and mostly likely is offensive to people, they still should not have that stuff taken off either, like I said earlier thats taking away from everyone else	10
7271	3357	If you dont wanna see it then dont buy it, or if something that you find innapropriate comes on just change the channel	11
7272	3357	History is important and I dont think people should keep you from your right as a citizen and deprive you from learning what you wanna learn or need to learn for the future	12
7273	3357	Now the music part i can understand, some @MONTH1 be a little innapropiate for younger listeners so like i said before again change the station or dont buy that @CAPS2	13
7274	3357	Dont deprive people of what they wanna learn, watch or listen to	14
7275	3357	People that feel offended or embrassed should be ashamed of them self because that is very selfish, and rude	15
7276	3357	No one should be ashamed of who they are or any movie that describes the old days in the way it actually happened, if they put it in the nice way then it would all just be a lie	16
7277	3357	That's why I dont belive in censorship	17
7278	3357	It should not happen, any book, movie, magazine, @CAPS2 should be available to who wants it	18
7279	3358	People see libraries as a good place for knowlodge and just an information place, many people like them and some dread of the fact of hearing the word, '@CAPS1'	0
7280	3358	To be honust I only know a handful of people who use libraries in my life as a source for information now days but	1
7281	3358	Can some information from libraries be offencive to others	2
7282	3358	The answer is based by your own opinion to be quite honust, but yes I think some iformation that can be picked up from your local @CAPS1 can be rather, disturbing 'per say'	3
7283	3358	Theres books and information that you wish you would have never picked up in your whole life, then again thats everywhere	4
7284	3358	Now music and movies etc	5
7285	3358	is sort of the same way, some @MONTH1 not agree with what he/she picks out and you know they might be interested in	6
7286	3358	Can it be offencive to people	7
7287	3358	The answer is of coarse it can, but because people will be people	8
7288	3358	You @MONTH1 not agree on something, but your friend might think entirely different from what you are thinking, everyone is titled to their opinion on anything, well normally	9
7289	3358	Now if they have graphic movies or explicit music on the shelf where your little son/daughter can just grab, I could see that as a major issue	10
7290	3358	Some parents do not want their children listening to that music at such a young age, even though the way things are in america your child will hear or see those things, it's life	11
7291	3358	If that is the case where a five year old can pull a graphic movie or a cd that a parent doesn't want them to see or hear, then I do'nt nessasarily think it should be banned from the @CAPS1	12
7292	3358	I believe it should be handled well mannered and it should be moved, to a not so easy reach to a five year old	13
7293	3358	These are common arguements people have, about many places and about simular disagreements	14
7294	3358	Yes, I agree some things found in a @CAPS1 can be found offencive to some but my answer stays as, 'No' it shouldn't be removed unless it really is that offencive	15
7295	3358	If there is something that offencive in the @CAPS1 and mutiple people find it offencive in the community, I would take it to the people in charge of the local @CAPS1	16
7296	3360	Libraies should not be able to remove books, movies, and  magizines off the shelves just because some kids might be offended	0
7297	3360	If the town libraries and school libraries took out the cool movies, magizines, and books that most kids love to read and watch then the kids that like those books , movies, and magizines would not return to the library any more	1
7298	3360	For example, I like to listen to hard rock, heavy metal, and rap	2
7299	3360	But, the people that go to church just like to listen to church music	3
7300	3360	If your with your friend one night because he invited you to come to church with him and you pull in the parking lot listening to your rap music some people @MONTH1 not like it	4
7301	3360	This doesn't mean that they should take the things people don't like off the shelves in order to satisfy them	5
7302	3360	Libraries should have a policy stating that if a child should check out a book or magizine or rent a movie, that they should have the childs parents sign and return a permission slip stating that their child has their permission to rent this book, magizine, or movie	6
7303	3360	Libraries should have an age limint to check out books and magizines	7
7304	3360	If kids would want to rent a movie then they would have to have a permission slip signed by their parents and returned	8
7305	3360	This permission slip will and can be used for all movies	9
7306	3360	Libraries should not remove their books, magizines, or movies	10
7307	3360	They should make a policy to allow older kids to check them out	11
7308	3360	So, library material should be a choice	12
7309	3361	Some people @MONTH1 think that certain book, movies, magazines, or music should be removed from libraries because they @MONTH1 be found offensive	0
7310	3361	I believe that libraries should not rid their shelves of 'offensive' material	1
7311	3361	What really makes something offensive	2
7312	3361	If someone were to tell me that it looked as if I've lost weight, I would find that offensive	3
7313	3361	The person wouldn't have meant it that way, though	4
7314	3361	Although I would have found it slighly rude, another person @MONTH1 have found it to be a nice compliment	5
7315	3361	With this logic, can one really conclude that anything is truely offensive	6
7316	3361	By saying something is offensive, you're stating your own opinion	7
7317	3361	Even if they aren't the same as everyone else's, everyone is intitled to their own opinions	8
7318	3361	equality is something most people find very important	9
7319	3361	Because of this, one person's definiton of offensive shouldn't be held higher than another's	10
7320	3361	If we rid libraries of 'offensive' material, that is exactly what you would be doing	11
7321	3361	you'd be making one person's definition of offensive superior to another person's	12
7322	3361	I also believe libraries should not get rid of 'offensive' material because by doing so, they would probably be getting rid of a lot of interesting material	13
7323	3361	Let's use my religious beliefs for an example	14
7324	3361	I am @CAPS1 @CAPS2	15
7325	3361	Basically, I do not believe in '@CAPS3'	16
7326	3361	If someone were to write a book about my religion, I would find it interesting	17
7327	3361	Some @CAPS4 @MONTH1 find it to be offensive, though	18
7328	3361	So if a library got rid of that book because someone found it offensive, I wouldn't want to go there as often	19
7329	3361	When I go to a library, I want to find a book that I'd enjoy reading	20
7330	3361	If all the material that is found offensive was taken out of the library, would there really be anything left	21
7331	3361	If so, I doubt many people would find it interesting	22
7332	3361	I also believe this because by taking a book off the shelf because you find it offensive, wouldn't you be offending the author	23
7333	3361	As I said before, everyone is intitled to their own opinions	24
7334	3361	Because of this, libraries should allow authors to speak their minds	25
7335	3361	By taking their books off the shelves, you'd be offending them	26
7336	3361	They took their time and effort to think about and write that book, and for you to offend them by taking it off the shelf, you'd be controdicting the entire purpose of removing it from the shelf	27
7337	3361	In conclusion, I believe that nothing can truely be defined as offensive	28
7338	3361	Also, people should be able to speak their minds	29
7339	3361	Therefore, libraries should not attempt to rid there shelves of 'offensive' material	30
7340	3362	Dear @CAPS1:     Have you ever seen an offensive book on a shelf in a library	0
7341	3362	Would you want your children influenced by these findings	1
7342	3362	These are the question you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries	2
7343	3362	As a concerned citizen I am writing to you to relect my opinion on censorship in libraries	3
7344	3362	In my own personal experiences I have come across magazines, books, and music that are offensive	4
7345	3362	I believe that these materials should not be found in libraries	5
7346	3362	There are many people that still would want these materials, so my suggestion is that there should be a seperate room for the offensive materials	6
7347	3362	If there was a seperate room, we can keep these materials away from young kids	7
7348	3362	When I get older and have children, I believe that the library should be a kid friendly place	8
7349	3362	In order to make that happen we need find a place for these materials or not have them at all	9
7350	3362	Libraries need to be somewhere were anyone can go: a college kid trying to prepare for a test, a young child wanting to discover @PERSON1, or a old man wanting to enjoy the peace and quiet	10
7351	3362	The distraction of offensive materials are not needed in a library	11
7352	3362	Libraries are places to learn and explore the different sources that are inside	12
7353	3362	For young children it is the fairytale land where anything is possible and the unimaginable can become true	13
7354	3362	If there are materials that adults do not want their children to see, they @MONTH1 not be comfortable having their child there	14
7355	3362	Libraries need to be kid friendly places, so that all the ages can enjoy what it has to offer	15
7356	3362	As you can see, offensive materials should not be in libraries	16
7357	3362	All ages should be able to enjoy what a library has to offer, and with some materials that is not possible	17
7358	3362	Please consider the following	18
7359	3362	Kind regards,         @PERSON2	19
7360	3364	Censorship is important	0
7361	3364	Especially pertaining to what books, magazines, movies, and music almost all people are reading, watching, and listening to	1
7362	3364	Some of the media such as books and magazines and such in libraries everywhere can be highly offensive to certain people or can send off the wrong message to children and teens	2
7363	3364	So, should we take them off the shelves	3
7364	3364	I personally think no, most media aspects that are on the shelves in libraries can be very offensive to people, but alot of it has to do with people's opinions	4
7365	3364	The readers are the ones that are claiming that the books and other media aspects in libraries are offensive	5
7366	3364	The authors and directors and singers just do what they do, and the judgement and opinions all come from the people, fans, and critics	6
7367	3364	We shouldn't be taking it all off library shelves just because it is offensive to some people	7
7368	3364	This leads back to the quote from Katherine Paterson when she states: 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We can't take everything off the shelves because everyone's opinions are different so if we censor everything, there won't be anything left	8
7369	3364	Right now, they are doing a good job with censoring everything such as putting a rating on video games, and movies	9
7370	3364	Rated @CAPS1 movies are known to be for adult watchers and same goes for video games	10
7371	3364	Music they play on the radio is censored of all the foul language, so they make an effort	11
7372	3364	That leaves people the choice to watch, listen, or read the things they want, and they have to know beforehand that it might offend them	12
7373	3364	Although sometimes people think censoring those media aspects is not enough censorship, that's about all that can be done to not offend others	13
7374	3364	By taking everything off the shelves because of people's opinions, it could potentially make someone else angry or them being lacked of the things they want to read or watch	14
7375	3364	Censorship can be wholesome without removing all media off the shelves and in the world	15
7376	3365	Censorship in Libraries     I know as well as everyone else does, that you can find almost anything, reading related, in the library	0
7377	3365	There is all different kinds of stuff in there	1
7378	3365	From children's books, to love stories and people's magazines, newspapers, movies, and music	2
7379	3365	Everyone is welcome in the library, of course, but is everyone aloud to look at whatever they want	3
7380	3365	I personally think it's a good idea to have all of this stuff in the library, for anyone, even though some of it's not very appropriate	4
7381	3365	For people who sit at home and don't have a library, maybe they want to know about something specific and the first place they would think about going is the library	5
7382	3365	Nobody can really help with what people @MONTH1 find in the library but i think it's a good idea to keep that kind of stuff in a public place	6
7383	3365	You could go on the internet to get whatever information you need, yeah, but, what if the internet doen't have what you're looking for	7
7384	3365	I like books better then internet myself	8
7385	3365	Anybody can put information on the computer, but atleast when it's in a book, it's true, because it has to be published and read by someone that wouldn't let a book with false information be sent out to the public	9
7386	3365	If the libraians are worried about underaged kids getting into books that they're not suppose to, then put it somewhere where they can't reach	10
7387	3365	Put the adult books in the adult section, and don't let the little kids go in that area	11
7388	3365	You could always put them up high too so the kids wouldn't even know they was there	12
7389	3365	All the libraries I've ever been to, had their own sections, the adults would go to their section, and the kids would go to their's	13
7390	3365	If the parents are afraid of what their kids will find, then keep them home and don't let them go to the library	14
7391	3365	Make your own at home, then you could put whatever books and magazines you want in there	15
7392	3366	Should certain materials be removed from our library shelves just because it has uncensored materials inside of it	0
7393	3366	My opinion is no, actually heck no	1
7394	3366	Now don't get me wrong, but I'm not the type of person that likes reading materials like that all the time, but every once in a while there is a really good book or magazine I would like to read that is uncensored	2
7395	3366	The bad thing is that  I am told I cannot just because it says something or shows a picture of something a teenager supposidly shouldn't be seeing	3
7396	3366	One of my main questions on this material is why are they allowed to show statues of the early roman times in our history books but not materials we hear and see on a daily bases	4
7397	3366	Half of the time the statues are of a naked person	5
7398	3366	I don't see why that is allowed but other materials about our times are not	6
7399	3366	We are in the time period were people are open that it doesn't bother them to see that stuff	7
7400	3366	Yes, some materials are not suited for teenagers my age, but honestly I hear offensive things all the time when I walk through the halls in my high school	8
7401	3366	Someone @MONTH1 have an opinion about how the material is offensive, but if its so offisive why do they bother even complaining or thinking about it	9
7402	3366	Yes, everyone has a right to their own opinion, but thats there opinion and that doesn't make them always right	10
7403	3366	That person can have there opinion but other people have opinions that might oppose the other persons opinion	11
7404	3366	Does that make them wrong	12
7405	3366	You will never know because everyone has there own and who knows whose opinion is right	13
7406	3366	Another statement I would like to just throw out there is that we teenagers are learning to make our own decisions because in the near future we are going to be adults and have to make those choices on our own	14
7407	3366	So, just let us choose if we would like to read material with uncensored things in it	15
7408	3366	It is our choice, why can't we just choose it without people telling us we cannot	16
7409	3366	I still do not see why it is such a big deal of reading uncensored material	17
7410	3366	Why can't they just allow the materials in our libraries	18
7411	3366	Don't make any decisions for us because we can do it ourselves, we are learning how to be more adult like, right?	19
7412	3367	@NUM1ed     The censorship of certain media is such a controversial topic	0
7413	3367	Whether a certain piece of material is considered offensive and should be censored or not is more often opinionated rather than logically opposed, because it really does all come down to someone's opinion on this matter	1
7414	3367	It is too difficult for most people to step in someone else's shoes or be persuaded from a viewpoint different from their own or even escape pressures from the general public to consider something else	2
7415	3367	Things get censored for a lot of reasons, too	3
7416	3367	Sometimes they're just so intentionally offensive that perhaps the author or producer wants it to be censored or would appreciate the controversy, or that a new view or opinion is so radical and against a majority of the population that it is just considered offensive for being so different	4
7417	3367	Well, when does someone have a right to take a song off the air or pull a book permanently from a shelf	5
7418	3367	The first thing that needs to be contemplated is if something is offensive or not	6
7419	3367	There are extremes to pieces of media where one sometimes must ask, '@CAPS1 were they thinking when they made that?' A movie being so outrageously graphic or violent is a fine example (although the same thing can happen in books, just with words instead of pictures)	7
7420	3367	At the same time though, whether or not something you might think as unnecessary gore in a film might just be @CAPS1 I'm excited to see when I go to the cinema - it's all opinionated	8
7421	3367	Another interesting thought is that somebody might come up with a revolutionary, radical scientific theory and write a whole novel or film a documentary explaining it all, but certain groups of people might claim that it is offensive to them	9
7422	3367	However, we might investigate into that theory ourselves and not be offended in the slightest	10
7423	3367	This is understandable though, people grow up in an environment that has its own set of ethics and principles, and people will honestly believe them and probably stick with those fundamentals throughout their lifetime	11
7424	3367	If you go against someone's beliefs that they hold so dear like that, they would of course be offensive to them	12
7425	3367	Does that mean that the something should be censored just because it offends a couple of groups in a population	13
7426	3367	Whether or not something is to be torn from the access of the public is left up to the opinions of the general public themselves	14
7427	3367	The opinion of the public is created by the current time, trends, ethics, and problems that are going on	15
7428	3367	When something goes against too many of those things, people get upset	16
7429	3367	If most people are upset by something, it will probably start disappearing from sight	17
7430	3367	It's bad for business, and libraries are losing customers already due to most people not having an urge to read anymore with all of the stuff that you can do otherwise	18
7431	3367	Certain things can just put a bad taste in your mouth, and if someone gets that too often when they go to a library, they probably won't go there anymore	19
7432	3367	So when it comes down to censorship in libraries, or anywhere, its just a bunch of opinions	20
7433	3367	If the general public does not like something, it will stop showing up	21
7434	3367	Certain books or other pieces of media are asking for the controversy that many subjects bring, while others are just unintentionally going against certain groups of people	22
7435	3367	People's beliefs are determined by where they grew up and when, and they'll hold on to those things for their lifetime	23
7436	3367	If something goes against those, people will be offended, and if enough people are upset, it gets taken away	24
7437	3368	Isn't  it shocking that some books, music, movies and magazines you find on your library shelf today aren't appropriate for the little ones	0
7438	3368	I believe that if you have to question whether a child should be listening or viewing this item then it shouldn't be in or around a child section at all	1
7439	3368	Some content could be offensive to not just children but also to teenagers and adults	2
7440	3368	Some music @MONTH1 contain words that are children shouldn't be exposed to	3
7441	3368	Music such as hip/hop and rap @MONTH1 contain degrading comments to men and/or women	4
7442	3368	I wouldn't want my child listening to this type of music, or reading any book that talks about it	5
7443	3368	Music @MONTH1 also be offensive to cultures, religion, sexual orientation and race	6
7444	3368	Books or music with comments such as that should have notes written on them stating what they contain	7
7445	3368	I was reading a book called '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2', that i had picked up in the child section	8
7446	3368	After the first chapter I had wondered who who call this a children book	9
7447	3368	The character was using profanity and talking about sex the whole time	10
7448	3368	My child shouldn't be looking for a book on pie then find out its not about pie	11
7449	3368	I once was watching a movie with my two year old that we got from the library	12
7450	3368	The movie was full of inappropriate words, therefore I had to shut it off	13
7451	3368	Movies like that should not be on the shelf at the library for my child to view	14
7452	3368	I now have to worry about what we check out	15
7453	3368	I also have had a few bad reading experiences	16
7454	3368	Magazines is a big one	17
7455	3368	Some magazines @MONTH1 contain content such as innappropriate pictures and words	18
7456	3368	Magazines should stay at the grocery store rather then a library that I take my child to	19
7457	3368	Books, music, movies and magazines should stay out of the childrens section if they are only meant for adult viewing keep them in the adult section	20
7458	3368	Any parent would tell you that they don't agree with some of the stuff on your local library shelf today	21
7459	3368	Offendsive content shouldn't be found in the library at all	22
7460	3368	I know now to keep a better eye on what my child is reading.	23
7461	3369	All kid's have their own style of books, @CAPS1 people like scary, funny, or romance books, but can we really take that to an offense	0
7462	3369	We should think of how taking @CAPS1 books off the shelf would affect more then one person, @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 be mature enough to read the more 'grown up' books or magazines, libraries have all types of syles for different people, you just might have to look a little harder to find the right book for you	1
7463	3369	I do not agree that @CAPS1 books and or magazines can be taken offensive	2
7464	3369	All libraries are different  types of books,for example  an elemantry school library they will not have grown up or teenager books, and a middle school will not have little kid books	3
7465	3369	We also have to think does peer presure effect what books or magaiznes kids read	4
7466	3369	, for example when I was in middle school my friends were all reading romance books, and I was still reading @ORGANIZATION1, and I had to change my reading style to fit in, so that's exactly what I did	5
7467	3369	Books that have offensive content shouldn't be taken off the shelf, I believe that if there is 'offensive' books in your library, just ignore them you @CAPS2't have to get that book, we cant just take the more grown up books out because @CAPS1 kids @CAPS2't know what their suppose to be reading	6
7468	3369	Libraries have all different style of books to fit everyone's taste, so just look for that right book that suites you, and @CAPS2't take all the books that have an offensive style of the shelf, @CAPS2't judge a book by it's cover	7
7469	3370	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
7470	3370	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
7471	3370	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' - @PERSON1     If one thinks about it books are such a magical escape from everday life	2
7472	3370	They can take one anywhere they want to go at anytime	3
7473	3370	Imagine a world where books are a luxury or where they are simply not present at all.I feel as if this would become an all too real reality if we censor books	4
7474	3370	Where would the line be drawn saying a book is unfit to be @CAPS5 or placed into circulation	5
7475	3370	This would hold the world back since we could not express ourselves through our writing	6
7476	3370	So much would be left unsaid	7
7477	3370	I believe the quote stated above is quite true	8
7478	3370	If we place censorship on one book everyone has a right to ban other books as well	9
7479	3370	Just because certain books, movies, and magazines are deemed offensive to some, does not mean they should be banned for all	10
7480	3370	No one should we withheld from a book due to age, race, gender, or any other factor	11
7481	3370	If one has ever been prohibited from doing something due to age or size the feeling is not pleasant.No one neccessarily said anything mean or hurtful it just feels as if restritions and boundaries were set for no particular reason	12
7482	3370	I have felt this way multiple times	13
7483	3370	I remember one time in particular	14
7484	3370	I went to @LOCATION1 with a group of my cousins and their friends	15
7485	3370	Since I was the youngest I was also the shortest	16
7486	3370	I could not ride many of the rides there due to my size	17
7487	3370	I knew why those heighth requirements were set, for my personal safety	18
7488	3370	This makes sense, but why should one be required to be a certain age to watch a movie or watch a tv show	19
7489	3370	Honestly some people are more mature than others and grow up faster	20
7490	3370	Everyone is different	21
7491	3370	Everyone has a different personality and different perspective, there is no need to ban a book for everyone when we are all different	22
7492	3370	One should not be ineligible to @CAPS5 a book or magazine or watch a movie	23
7493	3370	Not wanting to is totally differnet from not getting to	24
7494	3370	The popular book To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 was banned at one time in the @LOCATION2 simply for using the 'n-word'	25
7495	3370	This angers many especially when one ponders how much slavery as well as the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 affected and shaped us into who we are today	26
7496	3370	America is a great nation because of the @ORGANIZATION1.Do we need to have a @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5!Why should we restrict ourselves and limit our own personal freedoms	27
7497	3370	If anything is to be banned, I believe it is censorship	28
7498	3371	When one person is giving a right to do something, then everyone else should have the right to do the same thing	0
7499	3371	But every so often, you have someone that abuses their rights to something	1
7500	3371	I belive that all books, music, movies, magazines, and everything else has a right on a library shelf	2
7501	3371	And they shouldn't be romoved if they are found offensive because in almost every book someone reads, there will be some kind of offence in it	3
7502	3371	I also belive that all books, music, movies, magazines, and everything else has a pupose to it	4
7503	3371	And if the purpose is good enough for it to be published than, it should have a good message worth delivering to people, even if it is a little offensive	5
7504	3371	I've read a few books, watched a few movies, and heard a few songs that were offensive even to me in some way	6
7505	3371	But, considering that there was more of a purpose to it, and the purpose being a good message, I liked the few movie and songs that most people would say its 'junk'	7
7506	3371	I don't have alot of experiences because there isn't a lot that I can say is offensive, but the few songs, movies that are offensive to even me, I belive that there was some kind of good message there	8
7507	3371	I personally think that no one should have a right to take a book, a peice of music, a magazine, or anything else off a library shelf	9
7508	3371	Because everything has some kind of purpose to it, and has some kind of message in it for each and every person to discover	10
7509	3372	Yes, I think they should be removed from the shevles	0
7510	3372	Some books, music, movies, magazines, etc	1
7511	3372	are overated and young children go to visit the library	2
7512	3372	They should have a shelve for kids, tennagers and grown-ups	3
7513	3372	Everybody should have they own section for their age group	4
7514	3372	Young kids are already doing things that they shouldn't be doing, like hanging out in the street, hang with older kids	5
7515	3372	They watch inappropriate movies, when they should be watching something educational	6
7516	3372	The music they have out now days, children shouldn't listen to it	7
7517	3372	It's to much cursing and violent	8
7518	3372	More parents need to spend more time with their kids and talk to them about these things	9
7519	3372	There are certain things tennagers should watch and read too	10
7520	3372	I don't think they should read about killing or sex	11
7521	3372	I rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them	12
7522	3372	Parents will eventually find out what you doing behind close doors, they been through everything you doing or trying to do now	13
7523	3372	So just talk to them and be real about things	14
7524	3372	I think they should be certain magazines in the library	15
7525	3372	Young children beat theyselves up, because they don't look like the young actors and actress in the magazines	16
7526	3372	They try to rush their life and be somebody they not meant to be	17
7527	3372	Young ladies want to have big boobs and butt	18
7528	3372	Then, young men want to have big mucles and be buff	19
7529	3372	In conclusion, I don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc	20
7530	3372	should be removed from the shelves	21
7531	3372	There should be a shelve for young kids, tennages and adults	22
7532	3372	The music that is played on the radio now days, shouldn't be on there	23
7533	3372	Magazines shouldn't out on shelves for children to reach	24
7534	3372	There are certain things tennagers should watch and read.	25
7535	3373	I honestly think that anything should be allowed in libraries	0
7536	3373	If you think about it, there is a law called freedom of speech	1
7537	3373	This law should be all the reason for someone not to ban something for what it says	2
7538	3373	Also, in my opinion, if you find it offensive, you dont have to look at it or read it or listen to it	3
7539	3373	I remember walking threw the library in town and seeing a large quantity of books	4
7540	3373	None of these books really seemed offensive	5
7541	3373	Then again, this library had an upstairs that the more 'colorful' books were at	6
7542	3373	For example, some adult books etc	7
7543	3373	These books were offensive	8
7544	3373	They should not be banned though, they should only be moved	9
7545	3373	On a different akasion, i remember walking threw the library trying to find a book to help me with an assignment at skool and i seen several young kids looking at some adult books and magazines	10
7546	3373	I belive that these were put here for advertisements, however, they should be advertised in different areas out of site of kids and teenagers	11
7547	3373	Although it would be nice to see some books and magazines banned, it would be quite difficult to accomplish	12
7548	3373	I don't think that anything should ever be banned for what it says or shows or sounds like	13
7549	3373	Instead, moved from one area to a different area	14
7550	3373	For example, instead of showing certain things at low levels where younger people can get there hands on, they should be at a higher level or behind the desk.	15
7551	3374	Have you ever found a book offensive	0
7552	3374	Many people can say they have	1
7553	3374	They might not agree on the point of the book or certain viewpoints in the text	2
7554	3374	When this happens, people stop reading the book and other books in the same category	3
7555	3374	Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offending to certain people	4
7556	3374	Everyone has opinions, what would be left without books	5
7557	3374	At my public library, citizens of my city can request certain books, movies, music, or magazines to be put on the shelves	6
7558	3374	We are very blessed to have this available because if someone cannot afford cerain books, they can always rely on the library	7
7559	3374	Many people have been very thankful for this system	8
7560	3374	If certain people at the library do not want to order certain books requested by citizens because they find them offensive, what would happen	9
7561	3374	More people would stop going to the library because there would be no materials sparking their interest	10
7562	3374	Everyone is titled to their own opinions	11
7563	3374	Just because one person does not approve of a book does not mean that book should not be offered at the library	12
7564	3374	There are thousands and thousands of books on display at the public library, that does not mean you have to read all of them	13
7565	3374	There are also many different genres of novels, movies, music, and magazines	14
7566	3374	Everyone has interests in different types	15
7567	3374	If people all liked the same things, would not life be boring	16
7568	3374	In conclusion, certain materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries is they are found offending to certain people	17
7569	3374	Everyone is titled to their own opinions	18
7570	3374	If a specific book is requested and one person finds it offending, the book should stay in the library	19
7571	3374	There are many different genres of books, music, movies, and magazines	20
7572	3374	Imagine if the library did not have a certain type of novel you enjoyed, would you continue to go?	21
7573	3375	I think libraries shouldn't removed material from the shelves even thoug its offensive	0
7574	3375	The libraries should't removed offensive material because even though it might be offensive to some people other people still might want to learn about that topic	1
7575	3375	For an example the @CAPS1 didn't like the @CAPS2	2
7576	3375	In some books its has some offensive stuff about @CAPS2 that were stated by @CAPS4	3
7577	3375	Some @CAPS2 might take that offensive but other people from diffrent race or relegion might want to learn about what was said	4
7578	3375	Just because people read about it doesne't mean all of them are going to agree with it	5
7579	3375	People might have their own point of view, no one has there right of telling one person what they can or can't like	6
7580	3375	If cenorship starts to occur in libraries or other in other communtiy places, I think people are going to get mad and might have a bigger problem than some people being offensded of their material	7
7581	3375	They might think that they are being told of what they can or can't read,listen,or believe in.That will occur a bigger conflict and get a lot of people furious	8
7582	3375	I think it will be simplier if library haves the materials on shelves and people who are getting offended of what they have in there should ignore it because why will they read or listen to something if it only gets them furious	9
7583	3375	They might be offended of what one person says but who cares, not everyone is going to think or agree of what is being said	10
7584	3375	Its just a person point of view let them be them and just stick with what you think of yourselves  and in your believes	11
7585	3375	Not everyone is right and perfect just be youselves	12
7586	3376	Materials should not be removed from libraries	0
7587	3376	It should be left up to a person to decided what the see or view	1
7588	3376	Books, music, movies, etc., are materials used by everyone and for some a library provide a haven where the can get there hands on such things only and no where else, so shouldn't try to take away any of these things from any body	2
7589	3376	One reason why certain materials should not be removed from libraries shelfs is that there will always be some subjects, and materials that a great many people will argue shouldn't be seen, and there will always be other people who feels differently	3
7590	3376	And if we allow them to be taken away you will only be taking away a person own choice, which is something we all should strieve not to do	4
7591	3376	Also just who would be left to decide what material should be removed and what material shouldn't	5
7592	3376	Is there really one person who could make a such a choice for everyone	6
7593	3376	Also there is no way everyone could agree on what material should be removed, so by trying you would just be providing something more for everyone to argue on	7
7594	3376	I believe that if not everyone can be satisfied then why bother	8
7595	3376	Another reason why in libraries certain materials shouldn't be removed is that by removing certain materials you would be interfering with education	9
7596	3376	Books, movies and other such things are used for learning even weather people realize it or not, and the more oppuntunties a person has to learn the better	10
7597	3376	And who are we to decide what a person decides to educate themselves about	11
7598	3376	There has infact been times in history when people in charge have wrongly decide that the public should not be educate or know about certain things and it was wrong then and it would be even more wrong now in our modern society	12
7599	3376	A society that is based on learning and knowledge, a socity that in situration should not hinder a persons ability to learn	13
7600	3376	Also I realize some people @MONTH1 argue that for young children some materials are better left unviewed, but that's is where parents come in	14
7601	3376	It's there resoponsibility to decide what their children read or see and not anyone elses	15
7602	3376	And so there is no reason why anyone should interfere with a parents choice as long as it is in aggrement with the law	16
7603	3376	These are the reasons why I think libraries shouldn't be allowed to decided what materials and subjects are put on their shelfs	17
7604	3376	For some dicsion no one can make to satify everyone and to be in the right	18
7605	3376	Therefore it is better that such things are left up to the person themselves.	19
7606	3378	People believe that censorship is impotant in Libraries	0
7607	3378	They believe that things should not be released if they have a bad subject matter	1
7608	3378	They feel that it is sending a bad message to children and teaching them horrible things to do and say	2
7609	3378	I disagree with them on this and these are the reasons why	3
7610	3378	I feel that books/music/movies/magazines shouldn't be taken off the shelf is they have cuss words inside, i feel that they should continue to sell them even if they have bad words inside	4
7611	3378	I feel this way because there are alot of horrible things in this world	5
7612	3378	Children have to learn that, and i feel like cussing or anything of that subject matter isnt that big of a deal there is so much more to worry about then a couple of bad words children read and listen to	6
7613	3378	I listen to music that has cuss words on the inside and i also read books with bad words and it doesnt infulence me in any kind of way	7
7614	3378	So we shouldn't always try to control every one we should just let them be on the shelfs and let them or there parents decide if it's innaporpate or not.in conclusion i feel again that they should be on the shelfs and people should be allowed to listen/read whatever they want to	8
7615	3378	if it doesnt harm anyone or themselfs then let it go on and happen	9
7616	3378	let them do what they want to	10
7617	3380	No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive	0
7618	3380	You have the right to either read what you see or keep moving and read what you want to	1
7619	3380	Certain books, movies, magazines, etc	2
7620	3380	shouldn't be removed just because someone else doesn't like it	3
7621	3380	If someone of a certain belief sees something offensive to them or their religion, then they have an option to not read or look at it	4
7622	3380	Something that someone might find offensive might be interesting to someone else or they might have to do an report or project on it	5
7623	3380	There's no need to discrimanate against a book or movie just because a certain religion group or someone as an individual doesn't approve of it	6
7624	3380	It's an public library that has materials on display for the public	7
7625	3380	Any and everybody can come and read any and everything they please	8
7626	3380	A library is open to the public which means people of differenrent races, beliefs, religions etc., is going to come through and it's a possibilty that they're going to see something offensive or that they don't like	9
7627	3380	They have the option of either picking it up and reading it or the option of not paying it any attention and ignoreing it	10
7628	3380	The choice is theirs to either let someone elses's opinion actually bother them or not let their opinion matter at all and just keep doing their own thing	11
7629	3380	People have to be strong enough to rise above all the negetivity and keep doing thier thing and keep believing in what they believe in	12
7630	3380	It doesn't matter if someone hates or have hateful things to say about you or your perticular	13
7631	3380	Don't pay them no mind at all	14
7632	3380	I know you think censorship should be in public libraries, but that isn't fair to the people that are maybe being offended but they don't have to read it if they don't want to	15
7633	3380	They need to learn that in life there's going to be people that don't like	16
7634	3380	Even peoplr that @MONTH1 have hurtful or hateful comments to say about you	17
7635	3380	Learn to be strong enough to stand tall in what you believe in and don't let haters or other peoples opinions bring you down	18
7636	3381	I do not think that books should be taken off shelves just because it's offensive or because others don't like it	0
7637	3381	If everyone took the books, music, and movies off the shelves that they didn't like, then all that would be left would be empty bookshelves	1
7638	3381	I believe that the library was a right to keep whatever they want on the shelves	2
7639	3381	Some @MONTH1 say that the library has inapproprite books to check out, or they don't want their kids to pick up a book they don't like and read it	3
7640	3381	I think that's why the library has the shelves marked in sections for example, adult, young adult, children, and referance	4
7641	3381	I've never seen a book that was offensive to me in a libray, which brings me to another point	5
7642	3381	Everyone has a opinion, if a book is offensive to you it might not be offensive to someone else	6
7643	3381	For example say that you saw a book on animal mating and you thought it was a bad book for the libary to have because, little kids might pick it up	7
7644	3381	Well that is your opinion because, if a biology teacher seen a book like that then they might want to check it out	8
7645	3381	Another thing is that the library has certain book for a reason	9
7646	3381	Say that there is a book in the library that is about slaves, this book might be offensive to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 but, this book is there to inform people about slavery	10
7647	3381	What is offensive to some isn't offensive to others	11
7648	3381	In conclusion, I believe that books should not be taken off library shelves just because it is offensive to you	12
7649	3381	Everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things and you just have to deal with it	13
7650	3381	That's why I think that books should not be tooken off shelves	14
7651	3382	There are people in the world who might be offended by various types of literature, movies, music, or etcetera	0
7652	3382	I understand this, but I don't think they should be banned just because someone else doesn't agree with it	1
7653	3382	Other people might like it or they might like it themselves if they give a chance	2
7654	3382	Before you go saying that you don't like something maybe you should give a chance	3
7655	3382	Maybe try looking at a a few pages of a book you once heard about	4
7656	3382	Watch at least one or two episodes of television show	5
7657	3382	Before you make an ultimate decision about something, give it a chance first	6
7658	3382	Some people don't some media because it goes against their beliefs	7
7659	3382	If this is the case then just ignore it	8
7660	3382	If you don't like certain type of music don't listen to it	9
7661	3382	Maybe it is a movie your not particularly fond of then don't watch it	10
7662	3382	In conclusion, people should learn to give some things a chance	11
7663	3382	They should also shouldn't get rid of something just because they themselves aren't fond of it or find it offensive	12
7664	3382	That said, I don't believe that certain media should be banned.	13
7665	3383	For many students it is hard to compose essay's in a public school's library	0
7666	3383	Aquiring the neccisary information is comparable to finding a needle in a haystack	1
7667	3383	This is not due to the lack of funding or even the quality of teachers and staff	2
7668	3383	No neither of these problems is the cause behind many student's inabiltiy to compose thought provoking essay and analysis over a myrad of topics	3
7669	3383	This is due to the extremes in censorship that are being placed on libraries and schools in general	4
7670	3383	Many of the relevent topics and materials need to truely understand our constantly changing world is being removed from the grasp of those who will go on to lead this new world.Some prime examples of this tyrany on knowledge is the removal of books suck as @PERSON1, @PERSON2, the @CAPS1, and many other classical works	5
7671	3383	Each of these according to many parents has good reason to be removed from our libraries	6
7672	3383	@PERSON1 @PERSON1 promotes discrimination and racial supremacy along with being written by what @CAPS3 has pegged as one of the humanity's most vile of creatures	7
7673	3383	@PERSON2 uses racial surrs that are not appropriate to be in the hands of our young children	8
7674	3383	The @CAPS1 violates the separation of church and state	9
7675	3383	Many other classical works refference racism, drugs, murder, sex and use rampant profanity	10
7676	3383	All of these are valid reasons as to why a parent @MONTH1 advocate for there to be censorship of our libraries.These reasons, as well meaning as they @MONTH1 be, are no longer good enough to be valid in todays changing environment	11
7677	3383	Many of the books that have been recomneded to be removed show us an unfiltered view of a time period from a point of view that did not belong to the 'victor' of the social battle	12
7678	3383	As we know, '@CAPS3 is written by the victors.' @CAPS4 it is good that the @CAPS5 won the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and helped abolish slavery it is still important to realize that we still cannot remove the view point from our centers of knowledge	13
7679	3383	To forget is to remember at another time	14
7680	3383	That time is when we repeat the same mistakes again.For the parents who also want to save the innocence of their children by forbidding these books from libraries need to realize that the media has been pumping these forbiden images to their children more than books have	15
7681	3383	To censor our libraries is to cripple our children from the knowledge they need to fully understand our shadowed and fragmented world	16
7682	3383	Just because we try and close our eyes to the realities of the world does not mean that they don't exist	17
7683	3383	It is better to see and understand than to enter the world blind and dumb	18
7684	3384	Should offensive material be removed from the library	0
7685	3384	I think no, and there are many reasons as to why I disagree with this idea	1
7686	3384	Many books, movies, and magazines are not ment to offend people, but just to let the reader know how the author feels	2
7687	3384	I think that the books, movies, magazines, etc	3
7688	3384	should stay on the shelf because if they are removed what are we left with	4
7689	3384	Seems like all that would remain would be the dictonary	5
7690	3384	I think that when Katherine Paterson said, 'Children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that she was making a big mistake	6
7691	3384	So what seems to be offensive to people	7
7692	3384	Topics such as gosip and politics are a gold mine for authors in the @DATE1	8
7693	3384	Yet people find these topics to be offense probably due to that persons backround	9
7694	3384	If aomeone find a read to be offensive, then they should stop reading and that be it	10
7695	3384	Instead, people deside to go on a rampage against that magazine or whatever they read and what it banned for life from others to read	11
7696	3384	Readers have the choice to read whatever they want and if they disagree with that subject, just move on with their lifes	12
7697	3384	At the library I attend many poeple different shapes and sizes walk through the door everyday	13
7698	3384	Many of them like a different subject then the others, so its commen to find everybody reading about a different topic	14
7699	3384	Sure someone here and there does not gree with an author, but never decide to go crazy about it	15
7700	3384	Instead they just go pick a different read to enjoy for themselves	16
7701	3384	People read what they want to so they can enjoy it, not to bash the wuthor for his writing	17
7702	3384	In my own read's, I have found at times stuff i disagree with	18
7703	3384	Instead of going off the deep end and getting all excited about it, I choose to think about where the author is coming from and try to understand his side	19
7704	3384	On the other hand, some movies are ment to be for one type of audience when instead another audience see's the material	20
7705	3384	This still should not get movies or whatever the material is banned from the library	21
7706	3384	When on the box it says rated for teenagers and up, that means it is not for a four year old to watch and their parents get mad at them for it	22
7707	3384	If people followed what the box says and listen to the guidlines, then there would be no problem	23
7708	3384	I disagree with @PERSON2 when she said that some books, magazines, movies, etc	24
7709	3384	should be removed from the library	25
7710	3384	People have the right to read anything and to see anything they want, and if they disagree well they should just deal with it	26
7711	3384	In my own exprience, I have not found there to be a problem in my community library with people wanting content removed	27
7712	3384	Once people start following guidlines and reading the boxes and still disagree, then maybe will have something then	28
7713	3384	But until then, we should keep our nations libraries the way they are today	29
7714	3385	There are big debates today over whether or not certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offensive	0
7715	3385	Plenty of arguments are made from maybe somebody's own experience, observations, and/or reading	1
7716	3385	I have read plenty of people's concerns regarding @CAPS1 issue, and there are some valid points to be made from both sides of the story	2
7717	3385	No matter what your opinion on @CAPS1 issue is, there will always be someone who opposes of it	3
7718	3385	You see censorship of offensive language on television, but here is my take on whether or not censorship should take an effect on books, music, movies, magazines, etc	4
7719	3385	The first point that I would like to make about censorship is that people all across the world have come in contact with something that they @MONTH1 have thought to be offensive	5
7720	3385	When kids are old enough to understand what other people are talking about, they will come in contact with things that they take in offense at some point in life	6
7721	3385	I know from my own personal experience that you will see things that people think should be censored	7
7722	3385	Although I come from a religious family who does not like to offend anyone, I am old enough to realize that not everything in life is going to work out your way all the time	8
7723	3385	When you honestly think about it, you cannot censor out things that you hear in person, so why censor things in certain materials	9
7724	3385	The second point I would like to make about censorship is that no matter how much you try to censor certain materials, people will still find a way to take things offensive	10
7725	3385	There are certain things in life that you cannot control, and being insulted or offended is one of them	11
7726	3385	Even the most popular man or woman on the planet has been offended at least once or twice	12
7727	3385	It isn't about trying to censor every little thing that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people	13
7728	3385	Maybe it is about the people learning to deal with a little criticism	14
7729	3385	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	15
7730	3385	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work i abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	16
7731	3385	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is a quote from Katherine Paterson that makes a big statement	17
7732	3385	Almost every well-written book that you will find on the shelf has something that should be censored	18
7733	3385	What would those books be without those statements	19
7734	3385	To conclude @CAPS1 debate on censorship, plenty of arguments have been made about the views of censorship	20
7735	3385	Many observations, personal experiences, and/or readings have been done by many different people	21
7736	3385	Truth is, there will always be people who disagree on @CAPS1 subject, but that is just the way things are	22
7737	3385	We @MONTH1 never know who is actually right or wrong about @CAPS1 topic	23
7738	3385	We do know though, that judging form the previous points above, it is very unlikely that certain materials will be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.	24
7739	3386	Have you ever imagined a @CAPS1 without movies or music to entertain you	0
7740	3386	A @CAPS1 that has no books to read or magazines to inform you upon the latest gossip and fashion	1
7741	3386	Well, if items are banned from being seen or read then there will be no creativity in the @CAPS1, there will soon be no books or magazines to read, no music to listen too, and no movies to watch, and you will not be able to express yourself or your opinions	2
7742	3386	I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	3
7743	3386	If the @CAPS1 is left without certain materials there will be no creativity	4
7744	3386	Everyone will be forced to think the same thoughts if they can't learn about other thoughts that are protrayed to be offensive	5
7745	3386	No one can read about a topic that they are interested in if it is banned, this will cease creative thinking by not allowing people to think differently	6
7746	3386	In the process of deciding what books are offensive and which are not offensive, all books will eventually be eliminated	7
7747	3386	Certain topics aren't liked by everyone and, as Katherine Paterson says, '...if I have the right to remove that book..	8
7748	3386	so does everyone else	9
7749	3386	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson is exactly right too	10
7750	3386	if one person has the right to remove a book, so does everyone and this will cause everyone to take off that book that they dislike so much	11
7751	3386	Also, everyone likes different kinds of books and different topics, and this will cause less self expression because if someone doesn't like books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because they think it is offensive to @CAPS4, then there will be no books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on the shelves for anyone to learn about it	12
7752	3386	Everyone will turn out to be the same if they can't express themselves or their opinions	13
7753	3386	If a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned	14
7754	3386	If you can't read or watch a topic you shouldn't be able to think or talk of the topic either because you will offend someone	15
7755	3386	Also, if people can pick what books can be in a library, that will eventually be transferred over into other areas, such as clothing, food, thoughts, etc.	16
7756	3386	Eventually everyone will be wearing the same clothes, eating the same food, and thinking the same thoughts	17
7757	3386	I do not believe that certain materials should be exterminated from the shelves if they are found offensive	18
7758	3386	If specific materials are banned: creativity will be eliminated from our lives, eventually all materials will be banned, and we will all be the same by the lack of self expression	19
7759	3386	If you haven't ever thought about a @CAPS1 without books, moves, music or magazines	20
7760	3386	I hope you have learned how crule and boring the @CAPS1 would be without all of those materials.	21
7761	3387	Any one has the right to anything	0
7762	3387	Right to speak freely	1
7763	3387	to watch what they please	2
7764	3387	and so on	3
7765	3387	The censorship on the media depends	4
7766	3387	People who like that sort of thing can go to a place where they can buy censorship and un censoredship items	5
7767	3387	Every place these days has censored books, cd's, video games, ect	6
7768	3387	But then they also have uncensored items	7
7769	3387	For those parents or people who disagree with what is shown on the shelf	8
7770	3387	Also on @CAPS1 parents complain about whats on @CAPS1, well there is a channel button and you can change the channel	9
7771	3387	Or even in todays technology you can block that channel from ever being watched	10
7772	3387	No body ever said that they had to buy what the person in front of you is buying	11
7773	3387	People have the right to chose what they want to buy, wheather its censored or not	12
7774	3387	Say or do as they please as long as it's with in the rights of laws	13
7775	3387	Its all about your style and what you let your child see	14
7776	3387	@CAPS3, @CAPS3	15
7777	3387	Its not as easy to keep children from the volgure things in the new technology	16
7778	3387	They go to a friends house and that childs parents don't care and let there child watch anything from @CAPS4-@CAPS5 rated	17
7779	3387	The most you let your child watch is @NUM1	18
7780	3387	Its hard to keep a child sheltered from what you'd perfer them not to see	19
7781	3387	But what people have to realise is that there going to find out one way or another	20
7782	3387	Also a child who is sheltered will go to the extremes to find out whats on the other side of the railroad tracks to get a taste of the water, to see what they have been missing out on	21
7783	3387	Childeren will be childeren and they will sneak behind your back and do what they want to because they never knew what it was like in the first place	22
7784	3387	Any one has the right to anything, you as a person chose not to allow your child you have a @NUM2 year old rated game, but his @NUM3 year old friend does have it	23
7785	3387	Remeber hes going to play it at his friends house	24
7786	3387	Everybody has a different taste on censoreship	25
7787	3387	Some think everything should be a little cleaner others think different	26
7788	3387	So thanks to both sides, stores sell to you what you perfer.	27
7789	3388	@CAPS1 is the freedom of speech to be able to read, right and listen to whatever you want but under some conditions.I think that all books should be aloud to stay on the shelf	0
7790	3388	Like I said as americans we have the freedom to do and say how ever we feel about something without being worried about what will happen	1
7791	3388	But we should also think about what we are doing and saying and if something is wrong or harms someone	2
7792	3388	we should take rightfull ownership to our mistakes.But I do agree that some books should be taken off the shelves if they provide thoughts our ideas to cause downfall to our country	3
7793	3388	such as terrorist groups drug and alachol books should be taken off so we do not pullute the minds of our youth	4
7794	3388	Our youth today is very influenced by the music we listen to the books we read and the television we watch	5
7795	3388	From these things @CAPS1 shows us how to act, dress, feel, and treat other people @CAPS1 is the freedom of speech but say the right thing and be careful of what you say because some day @CAPS1 could effect you.	6
7796	3389	People should not take all the books out for the librarie	0
7797	3389	Beacuse other peolpe would probley like to look at those books also	1
7798	3389	If people start taking books out, all the book  will be gone .So  that would mean  where would be no books form people  to look at	2
7799	3389	So thats why there should be a law that you can only have a book out for a given period of time 	3
7800	3389	That would help to kept all the books in the liberary	4
7801	3389	So if people just start talking the book for the liberary there wont be any book left in the liberary to check out	5
7802	3389	So there needs to be a law that says that you can check out a sarthen numbers of books at a time	6
7803	3389	And how long you can have the books for 	7
7804	3389	If you dont bring the books back in a certain amount of time you will be charged	8
7805	3389	The amount will build up every day you dont bring ther books in	9
7806	3389	Also if you dont bay the bill you dont get to check out books until you bay the ammount	10
7807	3389	So that would be a good idea for people not to steal or take the books	11
7808	3389	About the Book, moives, and magzines  that are the liberary	12
7809	3389	All the books ,moives and magzines should stay on the shelves	13
7810	3389	Because if you take out one you should take out all off them	14
7811	3389	Beacuse every one needs to see  these thing in life even if it has some thing bad like a  movie  or a magzine it should stay on the shelves	15
7812	3389	So if a book,magzine,or movie gettes taken off the shelfes all of them need to be taken off the shelf .Just becauseit not fare to there author , beacuse they toke time to make what ever they did	16
7813	3389	If you get them mad thill stop making book for me and you to read	17
7814	3389	So thats what I think about the things you should do if you try to take books off the shelf in the liberary.But if its some thing really really bad mabey you should get it taken off the shelfs at the liberary or at any where they sell that book,moive and magzine.	18
7815	3390	I believe that all the uncensored books, movies, music, and magazines in a library should be taken off the shelves and put into a single room in the library and be labeled as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2	0
7816	3390	The children that go into the library at most libraries have a space where its just kids books but when the kids go with their parents or someone that is older up to the teenager and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 they dont know what they are looking at when they just pick up a random book off of the shelf and/or rack	1
7817	3390	Some people @MONTH1 think that it shouldn't be like that because they are weary of who might see them go into a little room marked @CAPS1 @CAPS2	2
7818	3390	However, if you don't want anyone to see you go into that room you just simply don't go in it	3
7819	3390	So by secluding the @CAPS1 books, magazines, videos, etc	4
7820	3390	you can keep the children from just picking up any book that has uncensored pictures or grabbing a video that the parents @MONTH1 not look at and end up being an @CAPS1 film and then the kid then might want to keep seeing the stuff like that when he reaches puberty he will be eager to have sexual entercourse with a boy/girl	5
7821	3390	Having said that, i hope that you see how my idea of sectioning off the @CAPS1 stuff will keep them out of the @CAPS1 stuff and keep them from having sexual entercourse at as early of an age as thirteen	6
7822	3390	As far as music goes, there really isn't a way to completely keep kids from listening to music such as rap that has foul language and it sometimes talks about having sex and drugs and the kids think that the artist who wrote the song made it to be a big shot and they did drugs and had sex and look how they turned out	7
7823	3390	The best way, in my eyes, to keep kids from listening to rap is for their parents to not let them listen to it while they are with them	8
7824	3390	However, the other music like @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 or even hip-hop rarely has any references to the topics of rap music	9
7825	3390	I could also argue that parents should watch out for their kids to be aware of the consequences of some of the actions they take due to these reasons and they should take the action of diciplining the kids for their actions	10
7826	3391	'@CAPS1'@CAPS2 say that word!' That is exactly what I said to my brother after he had read the front cover of a magazine in the library one afternoon	0
7827	3391	Personally, I am an advocate of not saying curse words	1
7828	3391	Yet, my brothers are influenced by things, such as the media, to say them	2
7829	3391	Should we allow the media to sprinkle words like this on to magizine's and books	3
7830	3391	Or should the items containing these things be removed from the library's shelfing units	4
7831	3391	Magazine's are one of many ways that we get the latest gossip on the most interesting scandals	5
7832	3391	They also appeal to a lot of people across the world	6
7833	3391	Most of those people are @DATE1 of age	7
7834	3391	Library's will most often place the magazine's on the shelf so that they can rake in some adult costumers	8
7835	3391	Most of  the content of the magazine's are pictures of half dressed women or men and explict lanuage on the covers these days	9
7836	3391	Should that be the new normal	10
7837	3391	I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 think so	11
7838	3391	I enjoy reading	12
7839	3391	I personally think that reading is better @DATE1 sitting on the couch and watching mind numbing @CAPS2.V	13
7840	3391	But, the material of some books have gotten to be where every other word is a curse word	14
7841	3391	Or they contain degrading scenes that no one should have to read	15
7842	3391	It used to be that books were read to learn something new, or to open your mind to a new culture or piece of information	16
7843	3391	In these times, though, it seems ardous to come across a good book that is like the classics	17
7844	3391	As though day by day, we are replacing the magestic words of authors for common words that anyone can use	18
7845	3391	Replacing such books like these on the shelves for anyone to read isn'@CAPS2 right	19
7846	3391	It shouldn'@CAPS2 even be allowed	20
7847	3391	With electronic devices such as the @NUM1 player and so on, most of the music comes from online sites where you purchase the song directly	21
7848	3391	Most parents @CAPS1'@CAPS2 know half the songs that the children buy, expecially when they @CAPS1'@CAPS2 buy it at home	22
7849	3391	With internet in many libraries kids can plug in their device and buy songs with offensive lanuage or graphic material without anyone knowing	23
7850	3391	Why @CAPS1'@CAPS2 the librarians put restrictions on the sites	24
7851	3391	The answer is that they can'@CAPS2	25
7852	3391	And, even if they did children would find a way to get around the restrictions	26
7853	3391	So, personally I think that they should remove the avaliablity of being able to download and purchase music at the library.Or take out the aweful lanuage all together in songs	27
7854	3391	Because the lanuage that they use is not needed	28
7855	3391	Although times are constantly changing and things are different then they used to be, with a little help we can restore it to where it used to be	29
7856	3391	Kids using such foul lanuage is an issue that needs to be taken seriously	30
7857	3391	From my own experiences I know that it is a growing problem	31
7858	3391	But, maybe if we put censorship in libraries then some or most of the problems can disappear	32
7859	3391	From magazine articles, books, and even songs explict lanuage and graphic scenes are almost everywhere	33
7860	3391	So, speak up and talk to someone about the idea	34
7861	3391	It might just start a revolution	35
7862	3392	Everybody does not have the same opinion on censorship	0
7863	3392	Some people don't like books and movies with profanity in it, but some other people @MONTH1	1
7864	3392	Also somebody @MONTH1 like the scary mystery books and movies, but others @MONTH1 not	2
7865	3392	I think all movies, music, and books are acceptable	3
7866	3392	I can understand why some people @MONTH1 want to remove some movies or books from the libraries	4
7867	3392	They want to because they are inappropriate, but the thing is, they are not inappropriate to everyone	5
7868	3392	A lot of people like the books and the movies with profanity in them because it brings out the real in the book	6
7869	3392	Personally I think that some magizines need to just stop being made	7
7870	3392	For example	8
7871	3392	@CAPS1 magizines are horrible to me	9
7872	3392	There is nothing but nude women in there	10
7873	3392	I say that the women don't respect themselves enough to cover up, but there are other opinions	11
7874	3392	Others @MONTH1 think it is creative and beautiful how the women look in the magizines, and it isn't jus magizines it's movies also	12
7875	3392	More and more movies are advertising sex and drugs in their movies	13
7876	3392	Everybody has their on opinion on censorship and everybody can not get what they want	14
7877	3392	I think if you are offended by a movie, music lyric, book, or a magizine don't read or watch it	15
7878	3393	Should certain materials be removed from your public library	0
7879	3393	Not everyone has the same views as eachother	1
7880	3393	What might be offenses to you, @MONTH1 be enjoyable to someone else	2
7881	3393	I personally don't believe that anything should be removed from a library, just because something you might not like someone could really enjoy	3
7882	3393	If you don't want to learn about something you shouldn't take that away from others who do	4
7883	3393	I think that if they do start removing things from library shelves they should still be allowed to be viewed to those who want to	5
7884	3393	Even if you just put them away would be better than taking them out of the library completely	6
7885	3393	More and more books are banned everyday, and I personally don't think that's fair to the growing generation who don't get to enjoy the things the old generation have	7
7886	3393	So I believe that no books should be removed from library's	8
7887	3393	If you don't believe or enjoy something doesn't mean someone else wont	9
7888	3394	What is appropriate in libraries these days	0
7889	3394	The opinions differ throughout the variety of different people across @LOCATION1	1
7890	3394	Censorship has taken a turn in public libraries, but still has been strictly forbidden from school libraries	2
7891	3394	Personally, I think that there is a difference between vulger and inappropriate items in a public library versus a school library	3
7892	3394	A public library is a place for anyone and anywhere to come and find an item that they are interested in	4
7893	3394	As we all know, everyone is different and have their own interests, so they should be able to find the book, music, etc	5
7894	3394	for them	6
7895	3394	The problem is, how do the libraries keep these uncensored objects out of children's hands	7
7896	3394	The answer should be simple	8
7897	3394	For thought, maybe all public libraries should be broken up into sections, each with their own subject matter	9
7898	3394	These different sections could include Children's, @CAPS1, and many more different titles	10
7899	3394	This set up is often used in well known book stores and libraries such as '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' and '@CAPS4'	11
7900	3394	Overall, censorship in public libraries does not need to be as strict as school libraries	12
7901	3394	School libraries are a whole different idea	13
7902	3394	School libraries are made to help assist the students' academic acheivement, nothing more and nothing less	14
7903	3394	However, I also think that the content in the school libraries also depends on the maturity of the students	15
7904	3394	For example, elementary and middle school libraries should have a stricter censorship than high school libraries	16
7905	3394	The students in high school should be mature enough to handle uncensored material without creating a huge scene, like we all know younger students would do	17
7906	3394	I have personally seen and witnessed a few so called 'inappropriate' books on the shelf at my high school library, but the readers of the book have been mature about reading it	18
7907	3394	I believe that some offensive and vulger items can be interesting and educational	19
7908	3394	It is all a part of growing up	20
7909	3394	The censorship in our libraries today vary from each library to the next	21
7910	3394	School libraries and public libraries are completely different places of literate and media content	22
7911	3394	I think that it is a person's own personal decision dealing with which library they go to	23
7912	3394	If a family with young children want to go to the library, the parents need to choose the appropriate areas in the building to search for the children	24
7913	3394	Therefore, there should be no problem in running across a 'bad' book	25
7914	3394	The author, @PERSON1, states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf..	26
7915	3394	And then we have no books left on the shelf for anyone.	27
7916	3395	The Author should be the judge on whether or not they want there book censored	0
7917	3395	I believe that libraries shouldnt have to take out books with offensive language	1
7918	3395	If the author likes how it was originally made, then thats how they would like to present it	2
7919	3395	It would be taking away a Right in the @CAPS1	3
7920	3395	If you were to write a book and somebody says you cant put a certain word	4
7921	3395	That isnt up to the public to make a decision	5
7922	3395	Its almost like rewriting history	6
7923	3395	It would be like having someone take out a word in the @ORGANIZATION1	7
7924	3395	If any word is changed it is a incorrect @ORGANIZATION1	8
7925	3395	It just changes the entire subject	9
7926	3395	You cannot reword whats been written	10
7927	3395	Public views are starting to take over the world	11
7928	3395	Instead of letting the facts be the facts people want to adjust things so it is less offensive	12
7929	3395	Next thing you know there will be a replaced word for slavery	13
7930	3395	Slavery is a strong, bold word that represents a horrible thing	14
7931	3395	If somebody switched that word it could lead to it happening again	15
7932	3395	I say with all my heart that people need to respect what has been written and leave it that way or dont read it	16
7933	3396	First of all, Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazined, etc, should be remove from the shelves if they are found offensive, thats question should not be ask ever in life	0
7934	3396	Why beacuse there are many people out there that read read stuff and listen to stuff that you might not like at all	1
7935	3396	when i first saw this question i answer to my self that, ''That if all people think the same way this world would be boring, and i answer the question by saying that there should not be any books remove or music remove, from any shelves' why beacause we all don tlike the same thing or do the same thing	2
7936	3396	In first place, I know that there are many different kind of thing that people beacause they love doing it and some dont do those kind of things beacause they really dont like or dont care about it	3
7937	3396	This is answering the question about removing books, music, or magazines from shelves even if the article the book, music, etc, say's or if its offensive to other people, that is not a reason to remove stuff	4
7938	3396	There are thing that you enjoy doing and things that you emjoy reading, listening, and looking, etc that other people dont like or hate about it	5
7939	3396	In second place, not only beacause you dont like something people should stop doing those things or stop buying those thing, NO!!, that is not the case here @CAPS1	6
7940	3396	or @CAPS2	7
7941	3396	you should not care just for you or do what ever is right for you	8
7942	3396	If you are a good person that wants to be someone in the future dont just care about you care about the other too, beacause you'll need those person or those book in the future when ever your falling down	9
7943	3396	In my conclusion, about this article	10
7944	3396	I think that people should not remove any thing from any library even if its found offensive to other people, those thing help other in life to do what they really want to do, while other are getting hurt for those offensive this that are writting on a little peace of paper	11
7945	3396	Hope this latter help you all think about and change your decision about this case, hope you all make the right decision that would not affect anyone in general	12
7946	3396	Thank you for taking your time to ready what I really think about removing articles from libraries	13
7947	3397	One person's strong negative opinion effects everyone else	0
7948	3397	That doesn't seem logical or fair	1
7949	3397	A library is a sanctuary for people to go read their favorite books for free, containing books from all types of genres	2
7950	3397	There is a book for everyone in the library	3
7951	3397	it's a matter of finding it	4
7952	3397	Therefore, finding a book offensive or unsuitable does not give one the right to take that privaledge away from everyone else	5
7953	3397	Books have a way of putting our mind at ease, whether that's because it's an escape or measured on how enjoyable it is to read	6
7954	3397	Books found offensive to one person could have a completely different impact on the next reader	7
7955	3397	some @MONTH1 even find the books relatable	8
7956	3397	For example, if there was a scene that one reader thought was too graphic or horrific for other readers, there @MONTH1 be someone out there who would find this scene enjoyable because they can relate to it	9
7957	3397	People who aren't capable of relating to such a scene would only find it as inappropriate and try to remove it from another's reach	10
7958	3397	One person's opinion is not of any more importance than the next person's	11
7959	3397	The book '@CAPS1' is a professionally written, fictional novel that has been praised for it's quality, hence the numerous awards won	12
7960	3397	Although, this book contains a rape scene and numerous other inappropriate events that this woman was succumbed to throughout her life	13
7961	3397	Even so, it is still on the list of suggested college level reads for @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 classes	14
7962	3397	It is disappointing to think that people nowadays focus on the graphic scenes in a novel, versus the exceptional writing style	15
7963	3397	If all readers were able to look past the surface amoung these scenes, less books would be contemplated on shelf removal	16
7964	3397	One person's negative interpretation of a novel effects everyone else's right concerning the censorship in libraries	17
7965	3397	Readers are fully warned beforhand of the maturity of the contents	18
7966	3397	The books are ranked, critiqued, summarized (back cover summary), and even sorted in a library	19
7967	3397	If one finds a book offensive, look in a different section	20
7968	3397	Books are sorted by genre for that reason as well	21
7969	3397	different genres apeal to different people	22
7970	3397	This applies to the maturity of the reader as well	23
7971	3397	Books are sorted according to what appeals to what age	24
7972	3397	If you find a book offensive, instead of having it removed from the shelf altogether, look in a section for younger peoples, or a different genre completely	25
7973	3397	If someone finds the book offensive, the fault is not of the book being there, but of the person being in the wrong section	26
7974	3397	The main problem concerning book censorship in libraries is not the content, but how the interpretations differenciate towards such content	27
7975	3397	On this issue, the other readers' opinions on specific books being removed are being significantly overlooked	28
7976	3397	For one to complain about a book's contents automatically give someone else the right to protect the book's contents	29
7977	3397	For libraries to remove books in order of censorship is viewed as favoritism and is completely against the rights @LOCATION1 has stood for	30
7978	3398	Do you feel that some material should just not be allowed in libraries	0
7979	3398	Censorship in libraries are a touchy subject	1
7980	3398	Many people with young children believe that some books should just not be allowed in the libraries, while others believe that because it is a book, no matter what, it should be allowed to be in the library	2
7981	3398	Who knows, someone @MONTH1 need to write a paper over that certain 'touchy' book	3
7982	3398	I think, personally, that as long as the book is in a proper section, it sould be okay for a person, of the right age, to be able to get that book or other material	4
7983	3398	The libraries should have a certain area for children's books and another area for adult or teenage level reading or material	5
7984	3398	This way, there is a less likely hood that a young child will end up getting a book with material for an adult or teenager	6
7985	3398	The library in the town that I live in has a clearly marked area for children and teenagers	7
7986	3398	This way, young children are not going to be looking for their favorite book with a book over something many adults should not even be reading	8
7987	3398	If people are concerned about someone being to young to read or view the material, the library can also put an age restriciton on the material	9
7988	3398	This way anyone who is under the age limit will not be able to get the material	10
7989	3398	The people who are of proper age will be able to get the material, however	11
7990	3398	Libraries are very important sources for studing in many people's lives	12
7991	3398	If people did not have a library, they @MONTH1 not be able to research a paper, or something else, that they need to get finished	13
7992	3398	I feel if people do not like the material that they see in their local library, then they should just not look at it or borrow the material from the library	14
7993	3398	I do feel, however, that little children should not be given even the slightest chance to stuble upon a book with disturbing material	15
7994	3398	There, in my opinion, needs to be a room with said materials that children have, in no way, access to	16
7995	3398	This way, children are not able to access the material, but they are still able to go into the library without their parents feeling that the children @MONTH1 see something unsuitable for them	17
7996	3398	I feel that those people who love reading should be able to go into a library, and not be afraid of if they are going to see a book containing material they believe to be unsuitable	18
7997	3398	I also feel that if I need to research something that is deemed, by others, to be offensive, I should somehow be able to research my subject	19
7998	3398	Also, if I was the author of a book that was said to be 'bad,' i would not want my book to be taken away, so that no one could read it, or study and learn from it	20
7999	3398	I do not think that censorship is something that people should take lightly	21
8000	3398	We all have the freedom of speech, so why not let the authors of the materials have that same freedom	22
8001	3398	There are procautions that parents and people who do not want to see this literature can take	23
8002	3398	Total censorship, I feel, would not allow for people to broaden their minds	24
8003	3398	If people just take procautions, there is no need for total censorship of materials, that someone worked very hard on for everyone to see	25
8004	3399	Libraries should not remove a book from the shelves just because someone didn't like it or finds it offensive	0
8005	3399	If there is a group of people that are interested in a book and want to read it more then once they will like telling a new person about it	1
8006	3399	Then if another student has decided they don't like the book and they don't want anyone else reading it becuase they find it offensive then I honestly believe it shouldn't be taking off the shelves	2
8007	3399	I think it would be different if everyone found the book offensive, but if it's just one or two people complaining then I don't think they should take it down and ruin it for everybody else	3
8008	3399	It's just a book and students should know just because it's there doesn't mean its directed towards them	4
8009	3399	I think they should overlook it	5
8010	3399	If your playing some music, dacing around, and just having fun with it then thats good	6
8011	3399	Now, if there is cussing and talking about drugs and those sort of things in a song then don't play it in a school system or around someone that @MONTH1 be religious or against that kind of thing because they @MONTH1 not like it and think that your into that sort of things	7
8012	3399	They might not want to be around you as much	8
8013	3399	Show them respect and play something everyone can have fun with	9
8014	3399	So if the libary has this type of music it should be monitored as to who checks it out	10
8015	3399	Movies are something you have to look out for too	11
8016	3399	Movies already have ratings so this kind of helps for people to check them out and make sure the movie would be safe to watch	12
8017	3399	If your getting movies from the libary then I would think it would already been watched by an adult there to make sure it can be watched by a student or a child	13
8018	3399	I wouldnt want my little sibblings watching something that they didn't need to see or hear	14
8019	3399	You have to watch out for magazines too	15
8020	3399	You want a magazine that is going to be interesting and clean	16
8021	3399	Kids @MONTH1 not know what is bad from good, but you still have teenagers	17
8022	3399	You don't want kids seeing nudity, cussing, or drugs in any magazine	18
8023	3399	If I were to walk in a library and see those kind of things in a magazine I would suggest you to take it off the shelves	19
8024	3399	I would only suggest that so the kids will have a healthy thought about things	20
8025	3399	I wouldn't want them thinking about doing anything bad like they saw in the magazine	21
8026	3399	I'm just looking out for their safety	22
8027	3399	Libraries @MONTH1 always need advice	23
8028	3399	They need to always have an eye out for things and make sure everything is clean and so that everyone can look at it, read it, or watch it	24
8029	3399	I'm glad we have these safety ideas for kids	25
8030	3399	I hope everyone has an eye out for these kind of things	26
8031	3399	I know I if I were to ever have children I would want them around something they understand and know, nothing bad and harmful	27
8032	3399	So thanks to libraries that have an eye out for things like this	28
8033	3400	People @CAPS1 Offensive by Libraries         I think that libraries are sometimes offensive,but not all the time	0
8034	3400	It  all depends on peoples different beilfs and thier culture	1
8035	3400	I can see where some things in the library are very offensive and where somethings are not offensive	2
8036	3400	I believe parents are more offended by things in the library ,because they don't want their kids to experience these things that are not the childs age	3
8037	3400	Movies that are at the library @MONTH1 be offensive ,because if a parent rents a moive for their child and gets home and puts in the @CAPS2	4
8038	3400	Then finds out that the moive they wasn't a kids moive ended up being an adults moive	5
8039	3400	Parents who don't want their kids to look at inporatiate  things should not be suable for their childs age.One way to sovle this problem is to keep a eye on their child and make sure they don't go anywhere esle except the childrens area	6
8040	3400	This would sovle so many problems if parents would actually follow through with this it might work	7
8041	3400	Some parents bring their child up they way they want to	8
8042	3400	Also the parent or parents teach their kids that they don't need to go in any other area expect the one they are suppose to go in unless their parents tell them otherwise	9
8043	3400	I do get offensive sometimes when I go in the library, because they are some people who thinks it's funny to look at things just for fun not for any purpose	10
8044	3400	They make a big deal about and I don't like when people do that ,because it makes you think of the library as not such a place you wanna be at	11
8045	3400	If i was a person who got offensive by something that was on the shelf at the library I would pass it up and not pay attention to it	12
8046	3400	But some people would tell the people who are running the library that this certain thing on their shlef is very offensive to me and bothering me	13
8047	3400	If I had an issue with the library for some certian reason I would complain	14
8048	3400	Because complaining will more than likely do something about it	15
8049	3400	Instead,of not saying anything it won't get done or change it so it's not offensvie to others	16
8050	3400	I would let  them know how I felt about a certain product in the library in a soft and calm manner	17
8051	3400	When you complain about something might as well complain in a nice way, because if you do then that person you are complaining to will be nice back	18
8052	3400	I know that everyone is not the same and feel the same about everything	19
8053	3400	But one thing is for sure is to keep on living life and don't let simple things about a library product offending you or bother you.You could not got to the library anymore if it's a problem or ignore the image that is offending you	20
8054	3400	There are so many ways to handle a situation like this it's just how you handle it	21
8055	3400	One way is to be respectful to people and people @MONTH1 be respectful back	22
8056	3400	Your attitdue has a lot to do with telling someone that something is offending you	23
8057	3400	If you can't get anywhere that way then just forget it and move on	24
8058	3401	I do not think books , music, movies, magazines etc..	0
8059	3401	should be removed because they are offensive	1
8060	3401	There are books movies and music that offend everyone if we took them all away we would have nothing	2
8061	3401	Theres no reason for all that	3
8062	3401	Thats why i say we do not take away offensive materials	4
8063	3401	First, if we took away all the offensive materials off the shelves they would be empty	5
8064	3401	As well as the library, the movie store and everything else	6
8065	3401	If something like a book or movie offends you i feel bad for you anyways, but just put it down and dont wory about it	7
8066	3401	Second, i dont think we should remove offenssive materials off the shelves because of what they mean to us	8
8067	3401	They show us the good and bad the right and wrong, thats what books are for	9
8068	3401	Books are important to this world as well as movies and magazines and such	10
8069	3401	But to some more than others	11
8070	3401	You cant get mad at a book or a movie so just learn from them	12
8071	3401	For instance, say we did take away all the offensive materials what is that going to do	13
8072	3401	Is it going to make the word a beteter place	14
8073	3401	I dont think so	15
8074	3401	I think we need stuff like that on earth to show and to teach us the way to be	16
8075	3401	To educate and informate	17
8076	3401	In conclusion, i do not think offensive materials should be remove	18
8077	3401	We would have nothing and the libraries, movie stores and books would be empty	19
8078	3401	We would also be pretty missinformed about life	20
8079	3401	So we should not remove offensive materials off the shelves	21
8080	3402	In the world, there are just some things that our children should not be exposed to	0
8081	3402	I believe that the media such as music, magazines, and movies set a high bar for the individuals in our society	1
8082	3402	I highly disagree with what the media feeds to our minds as to the way our looks and lifestyle should be	2
8083	3402	The library is a place where most children go to feed their imaginations with colorful books with morals	3
8084	3402	but the library is also where adults go to free their minds of work and to escape many of life's responsibilities	4
8085	3402	Most children from ages @NUM1 to @NUM2 draw a curious mind to the very adult world and seek to find answers	5
8086	3402	Now the library is not a place where a child can recieve adult information right	6
8087	3402	Wrong	7
8088	3402	the library shelves are open to any and everyones advantage	8
8089	3402	A child can just as easily come across the wrong track to take ones innocence	9
8090	3402	Some parents in sociey believe that their neighborhood is a perfect harm free enviornment to raise children	10
8091	3402	Little do parents know, it is a very uncensored world and at anytime a child can learn of it's exsistance	11
8092	3402	The media draws it's attention to captivate our children	12
8093	3402	We have to watch what we let our kids watch, listen to, and read	13
8094	3402	For example, the girl in the magazine who just recently got a nose job because her nose was too big is feeding the idea to your eight year old daughter	14
8095	3402	She believes that she can recieve surgery to fix her big nose that the kids at school tease her about	15
8096	3402	Maybe your son listens to rap or rock music that condones the use of violence, drug, and alcohol use	16
8097	3402	He will think its ok to pick fights at school with other children or curse the teacher	17
8098	3402	Or the movie with the sex scene in it could give your child the idea to go out and practice what was taught	18
8099	3402	In our society, there should not be an image that our children should try and sustain	19
8100	3402	We should teach our children that life is better explored through @PERSON1's '@ORGANIZATION1' or through the wonderful adventures of 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'	20
8101	3402	Parents should feed kids 'imagination' and not feed their 'image'	21
8102	3402	Life for our children should be about fun, knowledge, and life experience	22
8103	3402	but not everything that is on the shelves of our local library.	23
8104	3403	Have you ever been to a library	0
8105	3403	Have you ever thought that some material from the libraries could and have been found offensive and wanted them to be removed from the library	1
8106	3403	I'm here to talk about the content of libraries and what we should do with them	2
8107	3403	Every time you walk into a library, you are surrounded with books and other learning or reading material	3
8108	3403	Yes this material is helpfull in finding things to pass the time or to help understand a certain subject, but some have been found offensive	4
8109	3403	Stories such as romance novels or vulgar horror and action stories have been viewed as innapropriet to some ages	5
8110	3403	These novels contain anything from brutal horror, to adult material, or foul language	6
8111	3403	Parents argue that these books should be removed from the libraries	7
8112	3403	I do not agree	8
8113	3403	I beleive that such books and novels can be a great help to the immagination of others and get the mind flowing	9
8114	3403	Yes i do agree that some novels are not age apropriate for young children, but that does'nt mean that they should be removed	10
8115	3403	I think that if people are so worried about their children reading these books that they should either go into the library with their child, or simply give the child a certain area that they are allowed to pick a book from	11
8116	3403	Another way of avoiding these wrightings getting into the wrong hands is to section off the more aggressive and adulterated books to a certain spot in the library and allow only age apropriate people inside	12
8117	3403	An age restriction of thirteen years and up would be a responsible decision	13
8118	3403	An age younger could be innapropriate for them, but any older and it could keep them from learning and expanding their mind to it's full potential	14
8119	3403	The point of this writing is to show that removing these books and novels from the libraries is not going to help anything	15
8120	3403	if anything it could hurt us by not allowing our minds to reach newer and higher limmets by learning and understanding the complexity of these novels	16
8121	3403	sectioning off these novels in an age apropriate area or having parental discression will help to keep the age correct for the books that they get	17
8122	3404	Censorship in Libraries     In our libraries there are a lot of books that are very helpful	0
8123	3404	There are also a lot of magazines, music, and movies	1
8124	3404	A lot of the movies are adult movies ,but they do have a kid section at a lot of the libraries	2
8125	3404	Most of the books, magazines, and movies are all reachable by little children	3
8126	3404	I have been to the library as a child and seen all the books there	4
8127	3404	When I went to the library as a kid, I went with my parents	5
8128	3404	We would go there and mainly go to the kids section	6
8129	3404	I can also remember going with my grandparents	7
8130	3404	I would read books or I would put a puzzle together or something	8
8131	3404	I cannot remember a time when I went to the library and seen something that was offensive	9
8132	3404	I've never been to the library and seen anything that seems offensive to me	10
8133	3404	I'm sure that there is a book or a movie somewhere in every library is offensive, but to give you an example of a personal experience is something that I cannot do	11
8134	3404	If the libraries do have books that are offensive, they do a good job hiding them from me and other kids	12
8135	3404	I havn't heard anything about people finding these kind of books in other books or magazines that I read	13
8136	3404	I tend to not read very many books about the world	14
8137	3404	I like to read biographys about sports players and types of books like that	15
8138	3404	Whenever I read magazines usually they are about sports or cars, so I don't read much about offensive things that are going on, if they are	16
8139	3404	If the libraries have offensive books, but no kids or people that shouldn't be reading them, than the library doesn't need to remove them from the shelves	17
8140	3404	Some adult @MONTH1 come into the library looking for one of these books, so then they can ask and find them	18
8141	3404	So in my opinion, I think that the libraries shouldn't have to remove these books from the shelves.	19
8142	3405	We see them	0
8143	3405	We read them	1
8144	3405	We gossip about them	2
8145	3405	Books that are found with inapropriate language, pages with the word 'sex' on them, disturbing thoughts and ideas, cuss words, its all there, but yet they are still in our libraries	3
8146	3405	My views on censorship is that, yes, our libraries should be more modest and not have books on the shelves with these things in them	4
8147	3405	The  books in libraries across the @LOCATION1 that have found and profane ideas in them, is one of the direct faults in our teenagers today	5
8148	3405	In my personal experience with this, i have come across books that have had inapropriate language in them	6
8149	3405	I have also read books assigned to me at school that have had descriptions of sex and bad language in them as a third grader	7
8150	3405	As a young boy, I would go home to my parents and show them the content of the book and how despiteful it was	8
8151	3405	I've always been raised in a @CAPS1 home and seeing these things not only in schools, but on the bookshelves in libraries I believe is un-called for	9
8152	3405	I know that there are so many things that could offend people	10
8153	3405	Rascism, sex, cussing, rules, religion, but you need to eliminate the main things	11
8154	3405	It is impossible to please everyone	12
8155	3405	These ideas in magazines, books, in movies, and even in music has changed the world upside down	13
8156	3405	Even when I was young, we were taught no cussing aloud, and yet you see this all the time in books	14
8157	3405	In @LOCATION2, of course we have the freedom to do what we want	15
8158	3405	Authors have the right to put profane language in their books, and even dirty ideas	16
8159	3405	However, libraries are not forced to keep this content in their libraries across the globe	17
8160	3405	I believe that we should keep the future of @LOCATION2 in the back of our minds, that if we teach them this material, they are going to grow up in the world with no morals at all, and the world will become worse than it already is	18
8161	3405	In the quote by Katherine Paterson, I believe that she has made a strong point	19
8162	3405	If we take the books off of shelves, then our students, children, grandchildren won't be taught properly, and then there would be no education at all	20
8163	3405	However, I believe that from this quote even she agrees we in @LOCATION2 fear what our children read	21
8164	3405	So yet, why do we keep these books in our libraries	22
8165	3405	I believe that if we take these certain books, magazines, movies, songs, and internet sites off the computers, and out of libraries and schools, teenagers wouldn't be traveling down the road they are	23
8166	3405	Today, the world has turned to a disaster	24
8167	3405	The kids we saw @NUM1 years ago were on the right path	25
8168	3405	Now those same kids are smoking pot, having sex, getting girls pregnant, abortions, miscarriages, things that are not appropriate	26
8169	3405	And I truly believe that this content students read in schools and libraries across @LOCATION2 has something to do with it all	27
8170	3405	It is now in the hands of the @LOCATION3, whether our kids grow up to be the future of @LOCATION2, or the joke of @LOCATION2	28
8171	3405	We need this fixed	29
8172	3406	Offensive literature, sexual content, disagreeable topics	0
8173	3406	Books all have those things to someone some where	1
8174	3406	It would be impossible to get rid of all of the books that offended everyone and still have books left	2
8175	3406	There are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong	3
8176	3406	Censorship only causes curiosity	4
8177	3406	Censoring books could take away from learning	5
8178	3406	The real world is not censored so books should not be either	6
8179	3406	Consorship only causes curiosity	7
8180	3406	Young kids every day are told what to do and what not to do	8
8181	3406	Many people know that children are most likely to want to do exactly the opposite of what they are told to do	9
8182	3406	Being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth	10
8183	3406	No one likes to be told what they can and can not do	11
8184	3406	The same goes for being told what you can and can not read	12
8185	3406	No one wants the truth cut out of  their reading materials	13
8186	3406	Censoring books could take away from learning	14
8187	3406	In school children are required to read many different books in their english classes	15
8188	3406	Some books, depending on the teacher, have what some would consider offensive language and topics	16
8189	3406	What some people do not understand is that reading those things are a part of life	17
8190	3406	Reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life	18
8191	3406	In fact, the real life situation would seem to be more offensive	19
8192	3406	If we are censored from these things how will we learn that they exist	20
8193	3406	The real world is not censored so books should not be either	21
8194	3406	You can not go walking down the street and expect a loud beep to randomly play over someone's foul banter everytime they curse	22
8195	3406	When someone says something offensive in the real world you have to learn to deal with it appropriately and maturely	23
8196	3406	We can not cut out peoples offensive banter in real life so why should we do it in our reading material	24
8197	3406	Has no one ever heard of freedom of speech	25
8198	3406	That ammendment was created for a reason, to let @CAPS1 speek their beliefs	26
8199	3406	Everywhere we look today things are being censored and 'cleaned up' to make others happy who @MONTH1 be offended by whatever it is they are censoring	27
8200	3406	Sometimes it is appropriate for offensive language or topics to be written about	28
8201	3406	People need to be able to speek their minds and beliefs	29
8202	3406	But people also need to be able to have constructive critisism and be mature about offensive writing	30
8203	3406	Everyone will be offended in one way or another some time in their life by something they will read or already have read	31
8204	3406	It is just life	32
8205	3407	Books are important in the life of human beings wheather they are for studies,entertainment, or any other use	0
8206	3407	On the other hand, are some books offensive to readers	1
8207	3407	If certain books are offensive should you stay away from that type of book or get rid of the book altogether	2
8208	3407	With this being said, Should certain material be removed from shelves if they are offensive	3
8209	3407	Some reasons against this are you are taught to stay away from bad things, some people have different views of 'bad', and even if they are offensive they do not need to be removed	4
8210	3407	Some materials are offensive to some people but not to others	5
8211	3407	This is the case in anything for example movies, books, and daily life	6
8212	3407	Some people @MONTH1 think the type of words used in a book make it bad, but to others that is what makes the book	7
8213	3407	For example to show the full amount of hatred for a character you have to use some offensive words	8
8214	3407	Another example is describing how horrible a person was killed, it is not enough to say he got stabbed and beat, you have to describe just how brutal it was to please some readers	9
8215	3407	Another reason why books should not be removed is people are taught when to tell that something is offensive	10
8216	3407	If a reader discovers a book is offensive they should know to stop reading not finish the book then complain about offensive material	11
8217	3407	Also if a person rents a movie they know they aren't allowed to get an @CAPS1-rated movie then they should get another movie	12
8218	3407	People should know to not get a book read about the offensive stuff without stopping then go complain	13
8219	3407	If a person was concerned about a certain material they could ask people or go online to see if it is offensive or not	14
8220	3407	Even if a certain material is offensive it should not be removed	15
8221	3407	That is only the opinion of sombody	16
8222	3407	If the book was needed by somebody they would not be able to get it because it was removed	17
8223	3407	If material were removed because someone said it was offensive then ther would never be any more books	18
8224	3407	For the reason that anyone can be offended, so they might just say it was worse than it actually was because they are mad	19
8225	3407	For those reasons materials should not be removed	20
8226	3407	What if everybody started saying things were offensive ther would not be any more books	21
8227	3407	People should not have the complete say in the removal of books	22
8228	3407	Otherwise people would complain just out of spite towards certain people's material	23
8229	3407	So do you believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.	24
8230	3408	Every parent has their own opinion upon topics like this	0
8231	3408	but even if you were to censor out books, movies, music, etc., your child would still be allowed to find that book or movie on the internet uncensored	1
8232	3408	Yes, parents believe that having things censored will be better for their children, but children have much more technology and much more access to uncensored music	2
8233	3408	As each day goes by the minds of children become more and more cerious as to what the world has to offer	3
8234	3408	The more parents keep there children away from things in life the more chance they have of their child sneaking out or just not being the person you thought they would be	4
8235	3408	Every person is there own person	5
8236	3408	I personally would say to just leave the books, music, movies, ect	6
8237	3408	on the shelves of libraries	7
8238	3408	children will find out anyways, wither it is from friends, or the media	8
8239	3408	Its not to say that your child will become corrupt if listing to such music, but I believe that at a certin age parents should have talks with their children about stuff that is happening in the world, because children are not going to go be children for long and you will not be able to control them forever	9
8240	3408	Everybody was a child at one point in time and I am pretty such that most parents very much disliked when their parents would keep them away from things they wanted to do or maybe that they wanted to see, but life aways is not fair and these are just on persons opinions	10
8241	3408	Either way if you decide to take all the music and censor it out or if you do the same things to all the books and movies, etc	11
8242	3408	there will still be unhappy adults and unhappy parents	12
8243	3408	No matter what happens odds are is that children will find their way around these things, it never fails	13
8244	3408	There will always be some way your child can get around you, always going to be some way your kids will get past your rules	14
8245	3408	just think about it, if they disobay you once they will most likely do it again	15
8246	3408	It is in a child's nature	16
8247	3408	So like I said before every parent and every person has their own opinion upon topics like such, me personally I say just leave it and lets the parents of these children handle it the way they would like to, because yoy can not please everybody.	17
8248	3409	Should books, music and movies be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	0
8249	3409	Books, music and movies have a certain veiw set aside for the reader or veiwer at hand	1
8250	3409	If someone has a different veiw of the text then they should not even be reading or veiwing them but to have books that are great be taken off of the shelves because they represent different veiws to someone else is unreasonable	2
8251	3409	People should give these things a chance because sometimes the non-original things just don't work	3
8252	3409	To have movies band from the public because they are offencive is something that is something that is just a way to control what we see and what we here	4
8253	3409	Books, music and movies should not be taken from shelves for the fact that they teach us a lesson about life without it really happening to someone	5
8254	3409	Books are a way that people can express themselves with out actually going out and hurting someone or something	6
8255	3409	Poetry for example gives the reader a feeling of what the writer was feeling when it was produced	7
8256	3409	Books that have political or social veiws on something should not be discriminated because someone does not like the side that they chose or the way that the author presents it to the the people	8
8257	3409	In novels just because someone uses profainty does not mean that there message is any less clear	9
8258	3409	Their message @MONTH1 be that profanity is used to offten or that the way that the next generation below them my turn for the worst but it is not used to harm	10
8259	3409	Music is a way that people can express their emotions without taking it out on the people that have hurt them or the people that they have hurt themselves	11
8260	3409	When someone uses profanity in a song it is not specifically said at one person	12
8261	3409	it is used to say how bad they feel about what has happened to them that they need something to really show how they feel	13
8262	3409	Many people who hear these lyrics sang to them @MONTH1 beleive that the person is telling them that that really is how they feel when its just a verse	14
8263	3409	Music should not be taken away because it is just words and they should not hurt someone, especially when it is only a way to express	15
8264	3409	In movies you see someone get shot, bruitlly murderd or attacked and its already a horrible thing because someone died or because someone did not have a fair life	16
8265	3409	This violance shown on the screens in homes, movie theaters and schools is shown to teach people what dangers are really out there	17
8266	3409	they are not shown to teach people other ways to severly injure another person although that is how people perseive them	18
8267	3409	Movies are about taking an idea and showing the world your idea	19
8268	3409	to show the world that this is what you are thinking and that this is how you feel about something	20
8269	3409	To have this all taken away shows that the generations before us are scared of what it is that we can do when we are a whole or what we can be if we stand alone and say that we don't like something	21
8270	3409	Books, music and movies that are all based on something that is real should not be banded just because they show individuallity	22
8271	3409	just because they have the deacensy to show us the truth in all the lies told to us but a higher person	23
8272	3409	These people most likely beleive that there is a thing as a perfect life when there is not one so when people show the way that things are they get scared that their ideas of a perfect thing are ruined by those who know the truth	24
8273	3409	The censorship of only things that are truely vile should be censored not the things that have nothing to do with the way that the comunities are today.	25
8274	3411	I belive that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc	0
8275	3411	should be removed from public libraries	1
8276	3411	What if a young child were to stumble across an innapropriate magazine.	2
8277	3411	They would have the images stuck in their heads and could lead to unlawful decisions	3
8278	3411	There are many books and movies that aren't appropriate for most young aged children	4
8279	3411	I think that they should either be placed more appropriatly or removed completely	5
8280	3411	Some people will take certain materials to be more offensive than others, but if read, the person might get angry or start to have bad thoughts	6
8281	3411	Personally, I think that most fictional books are intertainment only	7
8282	3411	They do not display actual happenings or thoughts for the most part	8
8283	3411	If someone reads them as offensive, they might just be taking it the wrong way	9
8284	3411	Most Libraries have areas sectioned of for adults only but they aren't monitored	10
8285	3411	So how would anyone know if a child was in this restricted area where they shouldn't be viewing this material	11
8286	3411	They wouldn't have the slightest clue	12
8287	3411	I think that in today's society, most children already know about sexual graphics and whatnot, so why limit them to what they already know about	13
8288	3411	There are a lot of television shows and movies in the world that are much more graphic that books and magazines	14
8289	3411	Shouldn't they be banned too	15
8290	3411	The world is exposed to offensive material everyday	16
8291	3411	We just get used to all of it and do not take it the wrong way	17
8292	3411	But young children don't know better, so there is no gaurentee that they won't take ideas from inaprpropriate viewings and use them	18
8293	3411	So maybe things do need to be taken off shelves.	19
8294	3412	Offensive @CAPS1 @CAPS2     @CAPS3 entering a @CAPS1 you know your are going to find something interesting to read,listen to, or even watch	0
8295	3412	Most people use librarys to find information on a certain topic, some of these topics are not always appropiate for certain age groups	1
8296	3412	I do believe that materials on any subject should reflect how people see the world now	2
8297	3412	Most kids go to the @CAPS1 and look to find books that interest them, sometimes they cross book about stuff they should'nt know about yet	3
8298	3412	Libraries should be allowed to have anything on there shelf that they please but allow it to certain age groups	4
8299	3412	@CAPS3 you were a little kid and you wanted to look up information on racing, you might have passes by many books about racism	5
8300	3412	As a little kid you might not know what that is but all you have to do is pick up and read	6
8301	3412	That kid just went from reading abot nascar to reading about racism and different races	7
8302	3412	I believe that book should be kept in order of age	8
8303	3412	@CAPS3 a teenager goes into the @CAPS1 to look up a book, they should be able to go to a section for teens and get a book on there topic	9
8304	3412	In most libraires there are topics such as sex, killing , and viloent matters	10
8305	3412	Kids should not be allowed to view that detail until they are ready for it	11
8306	3412	If I am at the @CAPS1 I will always look for a book interest me	12
8307	3412	My skills on choosing books for myself has changed since i was @NUM1 or @NUM2	13
8308	3412	Now that older and like to read, I read more books about action and mystery	14
8309	3412	I was at the our hometown @CAPS1 and saw a @NUM3 year old kid looking at books about pregnancy and was shocked to see what he was reading after he put the book down	15
8310	3412	That same day I came across a younger kid approaching his father with a book about sex and one about killing	16
8311	3412	@CAPS3 I saw this I was suprised to see what was happening	17
8312	3412	I do believe that libraries should be able to showcase what they have but in certain age sections.	18
8313	3412	Kids visit the @CAPS1 all the time and looking for books to strike interest and will always find something different that they should not be exposed too	19
8314	3412	Libraires would have trouble containg what kids read, so they should exposed all the differnt topics	20
8315	3412	@CAPS3 your little and your reading about these topics, you will then be more informed @CAPS3 your just little older	21
8316	3412	Next time @CAPS3 you visit the @CAPS1 check and see what kids in your local towe are talking and reading about	22
8317	3412	You will be suprised @CAPS3 a child apporachs his parents with a book about sex	23
8318	3412	I think that all libraies should exposed what they want @CAPS3 they want to ensure knowledge to everyone.	24
8319	3413	I don't think nothing should be taking off the shelves at the libraries, if it's educational to your child in a certain way it should stay	0
8320	3413	Children can learn alot from the books at the libraries	1
8321	3413	If you need help or answers about certain things you can always find what you are looking for in a library, they have all the answers	2
8322	3413	You can not get everything off the internet some stuff you have to look up by opening a book	3
8323	3413	As I was growing up, I was able to get what I needed done for my school at the library	4
8324	3413	It's so many things at the libraries that's educational, you just have to know what you are looking for	5
8325	3413	For some of these adults, if you was having a hard time looking for what you needed at the library, do not mean the same for your child	6
8326	3413	Sometimes your children has a better time understanding then you did at their age	7
8327	3413	Parents please don't take away the good things out the libraries that could really help your child at times	8
8328	3413	If it was not helpful, they would have never put it in the library from the start	9
8329	3413	There are things that you would be better off finding in a book, because not everthing is on the enternet	10
8330	3413	So many sciencest found their information in a book, because its easier	11
8331	3413	You learn so many good things from a libraries	12
8332	3413	The books and things in a library help you with so much research	13
8333	3413	Taking materials out of a library I would have to disagree.	14
8334	3414	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines, do not need to be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive	0
8335	3414	There are multiple reasons to back up this statement, including an accurate quote from author Katherine Paterson	1
8336	3414	People build their character through their reactions of how people treat them	2
8337	3414	For example, in life sombody @MONTH1 offend another person, but that does not mean the offender is going to dissapear after doing so	3
8338	3414	How does this relate to libraries you might ask	4
8339	3414	Books and movies do not need to be taken off of shelves in libraries if they are found offensive because there are a lot of things in the real world that are offensive	5
8340	3414	It is your choice in what you want to read, listen to, or watch	6
8341	3414	Just because you @MONTH1 have the option of checking out something you do not think is appropriate or is offensive, does not mean you have to check it out	7
8342	3414	Some people @MONTH1 enjoy reading or watching things that are offensive	8
8343	3414	You @MONTH1 be wanting to argue, 'But I don't want my children being exposed to such offensive materials.'  That is why most public libraries are split into children and adult sections	9
8344	3414	If you happen to come across an offensive book in the childrens section, then do not let your child check that out	10
8345	3414	It is as simple as that	11
8346	3414	Trying to take the book off the shelf or complaining about it would only take up more time	12
8347	3414	The quote, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	13
8348	3414	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else	14
8349	3414	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us', by Katherine Paterson, is a perfect example to conclude the reasons why books should not be taken off the shelf	15
8350	3414	She is saying that if one person is allowed to remove a book, then anybody else would be able to have that ablitiy as well	16
8351	3414	Therefore, a book that @MONTH1 not offend you at all could be taken off the shelf because somebody else does not approve of it	17
8352	3414	Eventually, there would be no books left	18
8353	3414	In conclusion, if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offend you, simply do not check them out	19
8354	3414	You do not need to get rid of them because somebody else @MONTH1 want to check them out	20
8355	3415	No i do not think that books and other materials should be taken off the shelves of a library if someone thinks its offensive	0
8356	3415	Everyone has a different opinion on what books they like to read	1
8357	3415	I think that if you dont like the book and think its offensive that you shouldnt get the book and just leave it there because someone else might like that book and want to read it	2
8358	3415	Not everyone likes the same books but every book in a library is there for a reason	3
8359	3415	The library screans all of the books that they get in and wouldnt buy something if no one asked for it or  if it wasnt a good book to have	4
8360	3415	I think that everyone has a right to read what they like to read and that no one should have the right to take books off of shelves in a library because what if someone is looking for that book and the library is the only place that has it	5
8361	3415	Then where would people spend their time reading and enjoing the books that they have an intrest in	6
8362	3415	If everyone could just pull a book off a shelf when they thought it was offensive there wouldnt be any books left on the shelves and no one would have books to read	7
8363	3415	I also think that if you dont like the selection of books on the shelf that you shouldnt be lookin in that section, go to another part of the library and look at the types of books that you like to read	8
8364	3415	Theres something for everyone in a library	9
8365	3415	This is why i think its not a good idea to be able to take books off of shelves, no one would have any books that they like to read if everyone did that when they saw something 'offensive'.	10
8366	3416	I think that there are some books out there that really do need to be taken on the library shelves and just be put in book stores for ones own useage	0
8367	3416	Then there are other books that people just need to be more mature about like history books talking about wars, slavrey and books with curse words in them	1
8368	3416	School libraries such as the elementry and high school should have books according to their age groups	2
8369	3416	If the libririan knows the book is not something a young kid should read then they shouldnt let them check it out	3
8370	3416	The music,magazines and movies should also be age appropiate for the age groups too little children do not need to hear cuss words every five seconds in a song	4
8371	3416	Movies should be age appropiate too	5
8372	3416	Thats why libraries have sections for babys,toddlers,pre teens, teens and adults so if your really concerned that your child or even just your self are gonna find a offensive book or one thats not good for the age group then stay ing your own section	6
8373	3416	Lets say your a teen and theres a book that is not right for you too read and is for more older people then you should be able to tell a librarian that is there and maybe she can just move it out of that section	7
8374	3416	Every person feels differently about whats offensive and not  offensive though so libraries shouldnt have to take out every book that offends one person cause it's not fair to the rest of the people	8
8375	3416	Besides no ones making you check out that book	9
8376	3418	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,     I strongly agree that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
8377	3418	There are young chirlderen that will pick up a book, movie and/or @CAPS3 case, or even a magazine and read off whatever the front says	1
8378	3418	We @CAPS5't need younger childeren reading off whatever they know what to say	2
8379	3418	@CAPS7's already bad enough that they hear @CAPS7 from family members or @CAPS2 near them	3
8380	3418	The seller could also make an edited verison of the book, movie, @CAPS3, or magazine	4
8381	3418	The sayings,'You @CAPS5't like @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't look.','@CAPS5't got anything nice to say, than @CAPS5't say anything at all.',and 'If you wouldn't want to hear @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't say @CAPS7.',strongly apply to this	5
8382	3418	The way this world is coming to, @CAPS7 seems like they @CAPS5't really mind who sees their product, as long as @CAPS2 are buying their product	6
8383	3418	Now a days, @CAPS7 seems like the younger the child is, the smarter @CAPS7'll be	7
8384	3418	If a four-year-old picked up a @PERSON1 @CAPS3 case, saw a pretty much naked grown adult on the case doesn't put a good thought in their head	8
8385	3418	That child's gonna grow thinking, '@CAPS7's okay to be naked	9
8386	3418	@PERSON1 did @CAPS7	10
8387	3418	Why can't I?'	11
8388	3418	Childeren learn more things from family and freiends, before they start learning the truth in school	12
8389	3418	@CAPS7's just like you wouldn't want to take your child to the @CAPS8 @CAPS9, half naked to naked woman just walking around freely	13
8390	3418	Not something a little five-year-old needs to see	14
8391	3418	Just like a little five-year-old doesn't need to hear cussing or using the @CAPS10 name in vien	15
8392	3418	Having young childeren see, hear, say, think, or read things like that puts thoughts in their heads, making them think @CAPS7's okay to say whatever you want or to dress however they want, while they think @CAPS7's perfectly natural	16
8393	3418	Although, this @MONTH1 seem like a huge wake up call to some parents, but @CAPS7's not normal	17
8394	3418	@CAPS7's not more normal than telling your kids that they were a mistake	18
8395	3418	Things like that shouldn't be said to/ near childeren	19
8396	3418	Every parent wants the best for their child, they @CAPS5't want their childeren growing up in world that is full of bad nor do they want their childeren doing wrong	20
8397	3418	By letting companies sell their prodcut with half naked @CAPS2 on the front cover of a magazine or @CAPS3 case, or by selling books that talk about murding someone, hiding the body, and prays to @CAPS12 that they @CAPS5't get caught, or by playing music that is offensive in stores with younger kids, let's them think that they can sell whatever they want, promote their music where ever they want, makes the companies win	21
8398	3418	I'm not a mother, nor am I soon-to-be-a-mother, but I find @CAPS7 highly offensive that companies and stores would do that	22
8399	3418	i wouldn't want my child looking at a magazine than asking me questions about the @CAPS2 nearly naked, or have them ask me what a word means when @CAPS7's a cuss word	23
8400	3418	I certainly wouldn't buy a book that just looks strange or offensive to my child	24
8401	3418	As well, I strongly do believe in '@CAPS13 of @CAPS14', so the companies, in a way, do have a right to sell their product how @CAPS7 is	25
8402	3418	Just, if they really wanted to selll their product that much, that bad, than they should sell @CAPS7 online	26
8403	3418	@CAPS7 @MONTH1 cost more, but at least everyone would know that their childeren wouldn't see @CAPS7	27
8404	3418	Although, once you owned @CAPS7, than @CAPS7's the buyers fault if their child saw @CAPS7	28
8405	3418	That would be on the parents plate to deal with	29
8406	3418	Another thing with childeren, is that their brain is still developmenting at that young age, their imagintion is beyond fairy tale world, @CAPS7's kinda like their second home, only @CAPS7's inside their brain	30
8407	3418	Their brain is still developmenting and learning new things each and everyday	31
8408	3418	Once they go to the store with their parent (s), they're already jumping up and down off the walls for a new toy or a new pair of shoses, or just because they wanna run up and down the alies, @CAPS7's bad enough having them see something inopporty	32
8409	3418	I know I wouldn't let my childeren see things like those and I'm about @PERCENT1 certain you wouldn't want your childeren seeing those things	33
8410	3418	So, for the childeren's sake, think of them, their minds, and their developmenting brains and their off the wall imagaintion	34
8411	3418	Treat the childeren how you were treated growing up	35
8412	3418	Thank You,                                   @PERSON2	36
8413	3420	Sometimes i think its always good to have an anappropiate material on the shelves of stores or a library	0
8414	3420	i feel this way because of when you see stuff that is offensive, most people are willing to buy	1
8415	3420	Or maybe when you been through rough times in your life, people like to read books that can be offensive be cause it was a reflection of the way they've been brought up	2
8416	3420	My views on censorhip contain to keep the offensive materials because its what people like best	3
8417	3420	Music, magazines, books, and movies	4
8418	3420	All of these materials can entertain adults, and teenagers because of the anappropiate sayings	5
8419	3420	It seems to give people to boost up their style and ways to act, such as music as the number one offensive material	6
8420	3420	Music comes from everywhere around the world, where young teens adapt to that kind of music and starts to feel that anapprpiate vibe	7
8421	3420	Another reason my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials is because of what we see and watch	8
8422	3420	Movies and television	9
8423	3420	when we watch a movie thats is offensive and that can be very anappropiate, you learn from whats in the movie	10
8424	3420	Most people make movies that can teach lessons if your willing to follow behind, or some movies contain advice for people that are going for the wrong things in life	11
8425	3420	Thats one of my main reasons i think the newspaper should keep offensive movies in stores	12
8426	3420	Television is basically the same for movies	13
8427	3420	You can learn a lot from a offensive @CAPS1 show, you can learn what and what not to do	14
8428	3420	Also my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials of what we read, books	15
8429	3420	books are entertainment and what most of us like to do when we have free time off our hands	16
8430	3420	People seem to read books because of the catorgories that most likely are to fit the way they are, such as reflections of peoples lifes, rough, lovely, funny and drama	17
8431	3420	We attend to read these offensive books because of what some of us been through as a kid or just would like to read it because they wanna maybe feel the same sympothy that some one else @MONTH1 have had	18
8432	3420	Also books can be adviceful of ehat people want to do in life, careers that you @MONTH1 be intersted in	19
8433	3420	last but not least on my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials like magazines	20
8434	3420	Magazines are the least offensive object that is placed on a shelf	21
8435	3420	I go against the reason of magazines to be on the shelf because its alot of gossip	22
8436	3420	I believe gossip is one of the main reasons why most people buy magazines	23
8437	3420	Also because of the false information	24
8438	3420	The false information that that give, is what we wanna buy	25
8439	3420	But for the most part of my oppinion, i believe that this material should not be in the store unless they change it up	26
8440	3420	I believe the offensive materials music, movies, books, and some what of magazines should be on the shelves of stores because lots of people are willing to buy	27
8441	3420	They all catch eyes for gossip, provokinding adds	28
8442	3421	@PERSON1, an author, once said	0
8443	3421	'All of use can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	1
8444	3421	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	2
8445	3421	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In other words, she @CAPS2 prooving the fact that books should not be censored in any form of way, in which I take the affirmative side on	3
8446	3421	To begin with, censorship @CAPS2 simply the banning of certain things that are thought to be offensive	4
8447	3421	An example of this would be the society in the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1' by @PERSON2	5
8448	3421	In this book, @PERSON3, the main character and eventually the protagonist, @CAPS2 a firefighter that cause fires instead of putting them out	6
8449	3421	The government believes that books are dangerous because they cause people to become knowledgable so as a result, they order people to burn them, making society ignorant and a potential 'slave' to their government	7
8450	3421	Despite loosing his job and almost being killed by the goverment, @PERSON3 rises to understand that books have true meaning and that what the government @CAPS2 doing @CAPS2 wrong	8
8451	3421	This topic now poses a question: '@CAPS2 all censorship bad?' Of course not	9
8452	3421	Some censorship should be allowed as a matter of fact	10
8453	3421	For example, any form of media whether it @CAPS2 books or magazines that portreys hatred toward a certain religion or group should be censored by the government because according to our constitution, people have the right to believe and practice whatever they wish (also know as 'freedom of speech')	11
8454	3421	However, the majority of censorship does not take a good side	12
8455	3421	In the political world today, censorship @CAPS2 applied to people who speak out against their government or leader due to the fact that they had been dishonest or ruthless to the people	13
8456	3421	Even in our country today, the government applies this which in some cases violates the constitution because people have the freedom of speech, but to a certain extent only	14
8457	3421	Overall, the negative outcomes of censorship outweigh the positive outcomes	15
8458	3421	Censorship causes people to become uneducated which on the other hand makes it illegal for a person to speak out against something even if it @CAPS2 wrong	16
8459	3421	On the other had, censorship towards things that portey hatred @CAPS2 not bad either	17
8460	3421	In conclusion however, bad censorship causes people to become uneducated, at the end resulting in pure ignorance.	18
8461	3424	Regardless of if we are speaking of the religous demanding books such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series to be ripped from our shelves or @CAPS3 wanting to burn the @LOCATION1, books can always bring about controversy	0
8462	3424	In this country we are given the rights to freedom of speech and press, so why can anyone demand that a book be banned	1
8463	3424	Everyone in our world has different thoughts, beliefs, morals and values so why should we try to force our own views on others	2
8464	3424	We should not	3
8465	3424	Imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily through putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off	4
8466	3424	Music, movies and magazines are no different, all express the ideas and beliefs of their respective writer, and all deserve to be accessed by anyone who desires to do so	5
8467	3424	Books, there are lists of hundreds of banned books and honestly you could find a dozen reasons to ban any book ever written	6
8468	3424	If you ban one writers words because they speak passionately or discretely on a controversial topic, then you must ban them all, and if you have to ban the words then you must also ban the writer so that he or she cannot voice his or her opinion	7
8469	3424	If we did this then our country and our world would be without opinion, voiceless, and without a voice their is no direction and no moving forward	8
8470	3424	If the people of our world are denied the right to write a book on their opinion then what kind of world do we live in	9
8471	3424	If you can ban my words, then I can ban yours and we have both lost our voice and our chance at somehow brightening the future	10
8472	3424	Imagine the impact if the @CAPS4 had locked away every copy of the @CAPS5 because it brought about change and controversy	11
8473	3424	Imagine a world where we had never heard of @CAPS6 or @CAPS7	12
8474	3424	It would be a would far different from our own	13
8475	3424	A world without powerful voices influencing not only our daily actions, but hundreds of years of war, love, and hate	14
8476	3424	It would be one without direction, where people are left to wonder but never to express or discuss	15
8477	3424	It would be a terrible place	16
8478	3424	While children should not exactly be watching porn or reading '@ORGANIZATION1', they definantly should not be kept from reading, listening to, or watching anything they desire	17
8479	3424	Values and morals should be gained by reading, discovering and thinking, not forced upon us by our government or our parents	18
8480	3424	Rap music @MONTH1 have lyrics that some would consider rude but to another they @MONTH1 speak a message	19
8481	3424	To a creationist @PERSON1's views @MONTH1 seem stupid and offensive, but to an atheist they @MONTH1 be what makes sense	20
8482	3424	We should all have access to all opinions so that we can develop our own	21
8483	3424	We should not have the values and ideas of others beaten into our heads, we should be able to develop our own through an exploration through those of others	22
8484	3424	Censorship is wrong, our government has no business in what we choose to explore and no one should be restricted by the views of another.	23
8485	3425	I believe everyone has their own choice when it comes to taking a book off a shelf	0
8486	3425	You should know what your picking up	1
8487	3425	If you think it might be offensive to you, then set it back on the shelf	2
8488	3425	It's as easy as that	3
8489	3425	Taking offensive articles off shevles of libraries just because a couple of people are unhappy ruins everyones opportunity on maybe finding what they were looking for	4
8490	3425	Censorship in libraries is just uneeded	5
8491	3425	Everyone should be able to take care of themselves	6
8492	3425	Read the title before you pick up the book	7
8493	3425	It could give you a good hint on whether or not it might offend you	8
8494	3425	Children on the other hand should be overlooked by an adult just to make sure they dont pick up anything that should not be viewed as a child	9
8495	3425	Taking offensive articles off the shelves ruins good books for everyone else	10
8496	3425	Not everyone is offended by the same material	11
8497	3425	For some it @MONTH1 be pictures	12
8498	3425	For others it could just be words	13
8499	3425	But this offensive material happens in everyday life throughout the world	14
8500	3425	It just can not be avoided	15
8501	3425	So why take it out of libraries	16
8502	3425	If it's really offensive in any way put a warning sticker on the book	17
8503	3425	It will warn people that the book @MONTH1 contain material that @MONTH1 offend the reader of the book	18
8504	3425	It will benefit both sides of this argument	19
8505	3425	People will be less offended because they won't unexpectingly pick up a book and be offended	20
8506	3425	But the people that @MONTH1 enjoy reading the offensive books still can read them	21
8507	3425	Everyone has their own choice when it comes to picking up a book	22
8508	3425	You should have an idea of what your picking up	23
8509	3425	Just because you made a mistake and picked up an offensive article, why take it away from others that @MONTH1 enjoy reading them	24
8510	3425	Everyone is exposed to offensive material through everyday life	25
8511	3425	So why have censorship in libraries	26
8512	3425	It's not accomplishing anything.	27
8513	3427	Do I think we should have to take books off of shelves	0
8514	3427	No  we should not have to take certain things off of library shelves	1
8515	3427	Think of it in your own perspective	2
8516	3427	For example, say you like horror books	3
8517	3427	If someone else doesn't like horror and you do, and they take it off of the shelves, how mad would you be	4
8518	3427	I like @CAPS1 magazines	5
8519	3427	Magazines like @CAPS1 @CAPS2, or @ORGANIZATION1	6
8520	3427	If there is a bad picture or anything in it they took it off	7
8521	3427	My perspective is that if you don't like what you see then put the book, magazine or whatever it might be up	8
8522	3427	Don't just sit there and complain, because how would you feel if the same thing happened to you	9
8523	3427	I have had personal experience with these kinds of problems	10
8524	3427	At my school, we used to have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1	11
8525	3427	Just non-hurtful things	12
8526	3427	All it took though was one person to complain about it, and boom	13
8527	3427	They were gone	14
8528	3427	@CAPS1 fanatics like me don't like to see our favorite things gone	15
8529	3427	So really, what is the problem	16
8530	3427	The problem is that people can't handle what they see	17
8531	3427	It is understandable to a certain point	18
8532	3427	Like if your a very religous person, then yes i understand that you couldn't look at those things	19
8533	3427	But when you do it just to spite someone, then that is very hurtful	20
8534	3427	Finally, i just want to say that if you have a problem, keep it to yourself	21
8535	3427	Just because you don't like something, doesnt mean someone else won't	22
8536	3427	You wouldnt want it to happen to you	23
8537	3428	First comes censorship along with its totalitarian prowess, second comes the downfall of humanity	0
8538	3428	We have all seen the horrors of totalitarianism over time	1
8539	3428	From the @CAPS1 regime of @LOCATION1 to the banning of @CAPS2 in the @CAPS3 empire	2
8540	3428	It always is a terror that falls violently	3
8541	3428	Farenheit @NUM1 was written by @PERSON1 in the mid twentieth century, forshadowing a wicked future if censorship is brought to humanity	4
8542	3428	The human populaion will no longer have actual knowledge, only what they have been told	5
8543	3428	In this book, the population is forbidden from having any kind of book	6
8544	3428	Their history is completely makeshifted by the government into a psychological madness	7
8545	3428	As if propaganda doesn't warp the minds of people enough, censorship of books would be the end	8
8546	3428	Man must know his foundation and where he comes from	9
8547	3428	All it takes is one little book to be taken of the shelf	10
8548	3428	Eventually they all will start coming down til there are none	11
8549	3428	The government will erase history as it is and create one that warps the minds of all to believe the goverment is righteous	12
8550	3428	When the malignant being is the government itself	13
8551	3428	This all brings up one of the worlds greatest questions	14
8552	3428	What actually should be kept out of viewing for all to see	15
8553	3428	We all think it is correct to keep pornographic material and adult language away from children	16
8554	3428	What is it that actually made these things intolerable in the first place	17
8555	3428	We have been taught our whole lifes that these things are, but when real censorship comes in, so does the apocalypse of all knowledge	18
8556	3428	People believe anything they are told as long as enough people are saying it	19
8557	3428	I, without slight hesitation, stand against censorship in every way	20
8558	3428	People have the right to know everything	21
8559	3428	Parents still have the ability to keep things they see as unacceptable from their children as much as they please to do so	22
8560	3428	Let man choose what is intolerable to him	23
8561	3428	Censorship goes against everything the western democracies stand for	24
8562	3428	All freedoms are taken away by that one word	25
8563	3428	The democracies feared communism due to its totalitarian government	26
8564	3428	The communists censored everything inside the @CAPS4 @CAPS5	27
8565	3428	History has shown us time and time again that totalitarianism is unsuccessful	28
8566	3428	The people must be free and must be able to live their own lifes	29
8567	3428	Only then will they defend their countries so they can preserve freedom	30
8568	3428	Both world wars resulted in totalitarian regimes beeing taken down by the free, uncensored men of the democracies	31
8569	3428	A word is simply a word	32
8570	3428	People will always have their own views on everything	33
8571	3428	Arguments about every little thing will always be at hand	34
8572	3428	We all must understand that although we all have differences in our beliefs, we must prevent censorship and accept all	35
8573	3428	The day we dont, censorship will come, and noone will have the right to believe in what they want	36
8574	3428	It is humanity's decision and it must be made at this time when the world is at its greatest	37
8575	3428	What will become of the uncertain future?	38
8576	3430	What do you consider an offensive book	0
8577	3430	Everyone has their own personal opinion on what they think is offensive	1
8578	3430	So how can you justify that a book, magizine, movie, music, etc	2
8579	3430	should be removed from a shelf due to content	3
8580	3430	Of course there are the ones that most people would aggree that are offensive to young kids and even some adults but then again other people don't find the same things offensive	4
8581	3430	The items that do contain graphic content, cursing, etc	5
8582	3430	and does offend most people should be set aside and putting in a different shelving area away from the others	6
8583	3430	So honestly no one can say that a certain book(s), music, movie(s), magazine(s), etc	7
8584	3430	do not have a right to have a place on a shelf and should or shouldn't be removed	8
8585	3430	If parents dont want there children or teenagers looking or seeing certain material that is something that the parents need to take into their own hands not a library or anywhere else	9
8586	3430	Now if this is an item at the home of a parent and they dont want their kids to see it they have every write to remove it from the shelf	10
8587	3430	Then again if their child or teen finds this item and looks at it and the parents didn't want them to they shouldn't have bought it in the first place of they should have removed the item	11
8588	3430	So can you as a stranger justify wheather or not somthing is offensive and a parent shouldn't let their kid look at it, or that a library or store shouldn't have that item on the shelf	12
8589	3430	No you can't	13
8590	3430	If you don't want you children to see it or if you don't set standards and rules	14
8591	3431	Every book has a meaning or message that all should know about	0
8592	3431	Taking a book away from a library shelf can decrease of knowledge from someone that might need that information	1
8593	3431	Just because a book @MONTH1 have certain views that can be offensive does not mean it should not be allowed on a shelf	2
8594	3431	A book should not be discriminated by what the contets @MONTH1 have source of a reader	3
8595	3431	Positive and negative books should all be allowed on shelve for any whom that have an intrested	4
8596	3431	As for music and movies that could be place in the same catogoery can be reasonable	5
8597	3431	Its really not that neccasary to be place in a library because its a place known for peace and quite and relaxation	6
8598	3431	If music or movies become a hazard then it should not be welcome in the library	7
8599	3431	Positive side music and movie has a way for some that comfort while having a good book at hand	8
8600	3431	It is understandable to have a little tone in the with some knowledge within the eyes in a book	9
8601	3431	Magazine is another non neccasary object that is place in the library	10
8602	3431	A magazine can have a mixture of good and negative thing obtain in it	11
8603	3431	Not all magazine have something that can be use to educate	12
8604	3431	Most magazine are known for entertainment and update on well known people around the globe	13
8605	3431	Magazines should be removed from the library	14
8606	3431	The library should be an experience of a learning envirnment and only materials that will be a good help instead entertainment for pleasure	15
8607	3431	Remove a book from a shelf is like decrease from knowledge that could have been known	16
8608	3431	As to remove books should not be allowed no matter how or what the content of the book @MONTH1 be	17
8609	3431	As for music, movies, and magazines should be a limited for usuage in the library.	18
8610	3432	'@CAPS1 Should be Taken off the @CAPS2'     @CAPS1 should be taken off the shelves	0
8611	3432	Nothing	1
8612	3432	At least thats @CAPS1 I think	2
8613	3432	For ant book you can find some bad thing about it	3
8614	3432	People can not keep bad things away from kids it doesnt work @CAPS4 that	4
8615	3432	Wether it is cusing, sex, gore, racsisem teens will find them and I think it would be better if they were foung in a book instead of real life	5
8616	3432	Most young adult books have cusing	6
8617	3432	There is no way around it	7
8618	3432	Teens hear cusing every day	8
8619	3432	At home, school, or even at work and yes it is offensive and no there is nothing you can do to stop it	9
8620	3432	It is there and part of our life	10
8621	3432	Most adults think thats if they don't shelter teens then they will find all this bad stuff in music	11
8622	3432	@CAPS1 adults don't understand is that teens doo @CAPS1 ever they want to be happy	12
8623	3432	The music of today's is very offensive, but the @CAPS4 it!!!!	13
8624	3432	THat is @CAPS1 is 'hot' in the music world right now	14
8625	3432	Ok say a kid was from a run down home and all he had was a radio, and that radio only got one station and the station was pop music, which most parents don't @CAPS4	15
8626	3432	That pop music would make the kid happy	16
8627	3432	Would you really take that away from him just because it is offensive??	17
8628	3432	Sex a lot of really good books have sex in there, but if a kid is at home reading about sex the he or she is not out doing it	18
8629	3432	Plus sex makes books better	19
8630	3432	I read books that contain rape, and other sexual acts but I've never done it only read about it	20
8631	3432	Race is anouther big deal	21
8632	3432	'To @CAPS5 a @CAPS6' is an amazing book and every kid should read it so they can learn	22
8633	3432	That is the whole point in reading is so you can learn	23
8634	3432	We need to learn about those kind of thing	24
8635	3432	Keep us sheltered is not going to protect us it only makes us want @CAPS1 ever we can't have even more	25
8636	3432	Music, books, magazines, and other stuff help us learn dont take that away from us	26
8637	3432	If we don't @CAPS4 it we will not read it or leason to it	27
8638	3432	Don't chose for us let us learn on our own	28
8639	3432	It is our life	29
8640	3432	Let us make our own mistakes....	30
8641	3433	Libraries, not many people like them, but most people do	0
8642	3433	Libraries are almost in every town	1
8643	3433	People like to go there to read book, get on the computers, and do activities with their families	2
8644	3433	But there are some things that people would really want to do things there but they cannot because of their age or so, or it just might be prohibited at all times	3
8645	3433	Do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone	4
8646	3433	Most people really do not think that you must always go to the library for things because if you are a irresponsible person with all the damage that you have done to the item that you have checked out or how late you turn it could be the same ammount of money on buying that item	5
8647	3433	If you are a responsible person then you are fine	6
8648	3433	But some do not think that the libraries should be putting stuff there if they are not going to let any one touch it or check it out	7
8649	3433	So if they are not going to let one person get an item from the library then it should be removed from there, because there will be at least one person who will want to get that item and it would be rude if the librarian tells you no you cannot have that	8
8650	3433	Libraries should just stick to the same old same old a section for kids with kid books	9
8651	3433	A section for the middle schoolers and the teenagers	10
8652	3433	A section for the high schoolers and the adults and mostly everything will work out fine	11
8653	3433	Just want to make it fair for everyone since it is the public library of your town	12
8654	3433	Now that some facts and opinions have been stated hopefullly the libraries and librariens do think about what they are going to put and what they are not going to put on the shelves of a public library to make it fair for everyone	13
8655	3433	So do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone	14
8656	3436	I think that books, music, movies, and magazines should not have to be removed from shelves of libraries	0
8657	3436	People find entertainment to movies with sexual or violent activity in them	1
8658	3436	I believe that if we do take all of the stuff that involve offensive things off shelves then some people will be upset	2
8659	3436	In our generation today, people look forward to see things that they can't see at home with their parents	3
8660	3436	Music these days have a lot of bad language in them, but that's what makes people interested in them	4
8661	3436	The same with movies	5
8662	3436	Books, music, and movies today talk a lot about sexual intercourse, illegal drugs, and criminal involvement	6
8663	3436	This kind of stuff gets our attention, and makes us interested	7
8664	3436	If you have a child or someone in the family that you don't want them to watch, listen, or read about offensive stuff then don't let them see it	8
8665	3436	Most stores with offensive stuff have a back room where they keep all of it, so they don't have to worry about others seeing it	9
8666	3436	People do take it offensive sometimes but that doesn't mean that libraries should have to take them off their shelves	10
8667	3436	People can make there own decision of what they want to listen, watch, or read	11
8668	3436	Everybody can choose what they prefeir	12
8669	3436	Everybody has their own opion on things	13
8670	3436	I think that libraries will have more business with the offensive things then without	14
8671	3436	Younger people find more interest in the things that seeem like a dream, or things that seem so unreal	15
8672	3436	I think that they should keep offensive music, books, movies, and magazines out on shelves, because we have our own freedom to do what we want	16
8673	3436	Lots of people find many pleasures to watching offensive things	17
8674	3436	If you don't want to see or listen to stuff you don't prefer then don't look for them at the libraries	18
8675	3437	If you get offended because of a book, magazine, music, or movies than don't read, watch, or listen to it	0
8676	3437	America shouldn't be censored	1
8677	3437	Censorship should be fo young childen	2
8678	3437	If your grown and get offended by something having the '@CAPS1-word' on it then don't read it	3
8679	3437	If a movie drops the '@CAPS1-bomb' then don't watch it	4
8680	3437	i completly disagree with someone wanting to remove vulgar words	5
8681	3437	I don't get offeneded by swearing because its usually used in a funny way, like telleing jokes, or it makes a crappy song good	6
8682	3437	Censoship is helpful, but vulgar things shouldn't be removed from society, and it never will	7
8683	3437	More often than not, kids learn cuss words fom paents or friends	8
8684	3437	If you don't want your kid to cuss or be surrounded by cussing then remove them from that situation	9
8685	3437	It's the parents responsibility to protect or 'censor' a childs environment.	10
8686	3438	The books in the libraries that I have read so far dont seem like they would be offensive to anyone and I havn't really listen to the music in the libraries or watch the movies and the magazines seem fine to	0
8687	3438	That doesnt mean that there isn't any of those that can be offensive to other people but if there is then I think that they should take them out of the libraries but I think if someone found something like that they would probably just put it back and not go there again	1
8688	3438	If they took out every book, music, movies, and magazines that people thought were offensive then I bet alot of them would be out and that wouldnt be fair to other people because maybe they want or listen or read or watch them and they would be really mad if they found out they was taken out because other peoplr thought they were offensive	2
8689	3438	Some people would probably understand that some of those could hurt someones feelings or be offensive to other people but then theres other ones that dont care	3
8690	3438	I think that some of them should be taken out if they are really bad and I wouldn't want other little kids reading them and gettin their feelings hurt or anything but if there not that bad then I don't they should be gone and I don't think people would really care if those stayed in them	4
8691	3438	If thiers ones that are really bad and if they stayed in the libraries then probably no one would want to come back to the libraries and sooner or later less and less people would stop going	5
8692	3438	So the best thing to probably do is just take them out and keep the people that keep going in the libraries because alot of people enjoy reading and thats what they do for fun and they would be really upset if they couldnt go no more over something that stupid	6
8693	3439	I think that most books, magazines or any kind of reading material that has offensive stuff to people are ok	0
8694	3439	Many people needs to read them and see what they are about	1
8695	3439	I think people take little things such as, curse words, or if the book or magizine is talking about drugs people take offensve	2
8696	3439	I don't think there is one book out there that doesn't have a curse word in it	3
8697	3439	Many people complain about small things like that when the reading material could be a lot worse than it is	4
8698	3439	I have read many books that have inappropriate words in them	5
8699	3439	I had a situation once when the title of the book sounded great and when I started reading it it had a lot of curse words in it	6
8700	3439	I guess thats just how it is now a days	7
8701	3439	You honestly cannot find a book without atleast one bad word in it	8
8702	3439	People just need to learn to get over the fact that many offensive things are found in many different reading materials	9
8703	3439	I do not think that the books, music, movie, magizines etc	10
8704	3439	should be removed from the shelves	11
8705	3439	It could be interesting to someone else but not you	12
8706	3439	Many people have different oppinions about different kinds of things and I think it should just be left up to that person weather or not they read, listen or even look at certain kind of reading material.	13
8707	3440	Should taking books, music, and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned	0
8708	3440	Aa stated in our constitutuion, people have the freedom to information	1
8709	3440	People have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country	2
8710	3440	Also @CAPS1 have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not too	3
8711	3440	So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off shelves is completely out of the question,     In the @ORGANIZATION1, it @ORGANIZATION1 that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including freedom to information	4
8712	3440	Due to this reason places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on there shelves	5
8713	3440	Even if some of the conduct is inapropriate, it is still serves a way to educate	6
8714	3440	Which for children, education is largely what their childhood is for	7
8715	3440	Parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home	8
8716	3440	If books were to be taken of the shelves, we @CAPS1 would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world	9
8717	3440	All books or magazines @MONTH1 benificial to some and offensive to others	10
8718	3440	However for those who would find this beneficial do we want to simply go against our @ORGANIZATION1 and deprive them of that information	11
8719	3440	Another topic in the @ORGANIZATION1 is the freedom of choice	12
8720	3440	Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelve, children have the choice to pick them up	13
8721	3440	Parents should simply tell there kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else	14
8722	3440	Having books that @MONTH1 seem innapropriate to some, aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelve	15
8723	3440	However some, @MONTH1 come aross a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out	16
8724	3440	This action plays no effect on child who is not supossed to be viewing material like that	17
8725	3440	Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information, all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it	18
8726	3440	As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines	19
8727	3440	For example I was restricted from watching rated @CAPS2 movies or things with innapropriate sexual actions	20
8728	3440	Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content	21
8729	3440	For most of my childhood I did this and it was very simple	22
8730	3440	However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children	23
8731	3440	For the reason that it's their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all	24
8732	3440	Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privelage to view them	25
8733	3440	In conclusion, removing materials,s uch as books, music, and movies is completely absurd	26
8734	3440	As I said before doing something like this, would be going against our constitutuion	27
8735	3440	The answer to solving this problem to me is black and white, children should just not pick up those types of materials end  of case	28
8736	3442	DO I BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUCH AS BOOKS, MUSIC, MOVIES, MAGAZINES, ETC., SHOULD BE REMOVE FROM THE SHELVES IF THEY ARE FOUND OFFESIVE	0
8737	3442	I WOULD HAVE TO SAY NO	1
8738	3442	THE REASONE WHY I STATE THIS BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE BOOKS THAT HELP YOU THROUGH OUT YOUR LIFE	2
8739	3442	THERE ARE RUDE AND HORABLE THINGS OUT IN THE WORLD	3
8740	3442	LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS EASY AND SOME OF THOSE BOOKS WOULD HELP YOU WITH YOUR DESION MAKING	4
8741	3442	NOW THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY I THINK SO	5
8742	3442	FIRST, HOW WOULD THE BOOK HELP OTHERS IN THE LONG RUN	6
8743	3442	I THINK IT WOULD BECAUSE SOME BOOKS TALK ABOUT THRE REAL DEAL	7
8744	3442	LIKE HOW TEENAGE GIRL BEING A  MOTHER AT A YOUNG AGE, OR HOW KIDS DONT FINISH SCHOOL AND NOW THEY ON THE STREET, IN JAIL, OR WORST	8
8745	3442	BOOKS MATERIALS LIKE THESE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOMEONE LIFE OTHER THAN YOU	9
8746	3442	SO THATS ONE REASON	10
8747	3442	SECONDLY, THESE BOOKS IS LIKE A GUIDE TO OTHERS	11
8748	3442	THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE,  IF PEOPLE READ ABOUT VOILENCE AND STUFF THEY WOULD SEE WHAT THEY DONT WANT TO  GO THREW LIKE MYSELF FOR EXAMPLE	12
8749	3442	I WAS READING THIS BOOK CALL MY HOOD	13
8750	3442	AND THIS BOOK TALK ABOUT ALOT OF STUFF THAT I HAVE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES LIKE GANG BANGING, SEX, DRUGS, HOOD FIGHTS ETC., THAT HAPPENS IN THE REAL WORLD	14
8751	3442	THIRDLY, MANY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW OF DONT REALLY LIKE TO GET ADVISE OR TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR PROMBLEMS	15
8752	3442	AND THEY CAN GET A BOOK OR SOMTHING THAT HAVE THE SAME FEATURES AS WHAT THEY MIGHT BE GOING THREW	16
8753	3442	THOSE BOOKS AND THINGS IS NOT VERY BAD THEY ACTUALLY HELP	17
8754	3442	AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE THEY REALLY NOT BAD THERE LIKE A LITTLE GUIDE TO MANY PEOPLE	18
8755	3442	SO IN CONCLUSION DO I BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUCH AS BOOKS, MUSIC, MAGAZINE, ETC., SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF THEY ARE FOUND OFFENSIVE	19
8756	3442	ABOSULTLY NOT BECAUSE THOSE BOOK TALKS ABOUT REAL LIFE AND LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS FAIR	20
8757	3443	Censorship or not	0
8758	3443	That is the question	1
8759	3443	Many people @MONTH1 not realize it, but what they read and watch greatly affects them	2
8760	3443	If children watch a scary movie, then nightmares seem to occur more often	3
8761	3443	If teens read a book where parties seem cool and bad  things are glorified, they too start to see bad as good	4
8762	3443	What if @CAPS2 article you are reading right now contained offensive language and inappropriate ideas	5
8763	3443	Most people would be offended and complain	6
8764	3443	I fyou saw an old man walking down the street yelling out obtrusive things, you would be mad and tell him to quit	7
8765	3443	So then the question is arised, why is it alright for us to watch movies like @CAPS2	8
8766	3443	Yes, books and movies should be censored	9
8767	3443	Children are very naive at a young age	10
8768	3443	When a child starts getting exposed to violence, illegal acts, alcohol and drugs in books or movies, they start to think it's okay	11
8769	3443	For instance, when I was younger, I watched the movie '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 movie contains a profanity every other word, so it seems	12
8770	3443	I saw my favorite actors on @CAPS2 movie saying bad words, so I figured it was alright	13
8771	3443	It's not okay for a child to talk offensively like that	14
8772	3443	One day I even heard a little @LOCATION2 quoting lines from the '@CAPS3.' @CAPS2 movie is hilarious but extremely suggestive	15
8773	3443	It made me sad to hear an innocent little @LOCATION2 talking about things that are way over his head	16
8774	3443	Teenagers that listen to music from @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 are getting bad messages	17
8775	3443	Although these two rappers are seen as modern day music heroes, they shouldn't be glorified the way they are	18
8776	3443	They're songs are all about smoking weed and getting high	19
8777	3443	They make it seem cool	20
8778	3443	So teenagers think, '@CAPS5 if they can do it, so can I!' They start to engage in activities that were once frowned upon	21
8779	3443	If teenagers were't exposed to @CAPS2 kind of music, they wouldn't be as apt to take part in such things	22
8780	3443	As for adults, their movies and books should be censored too	23
8781	3443	One @MONTH1 think that once they're older they can do waht they want, but that's not the case	24
8782	3443	Let me throw out an example to you	25
8783	3443	Let's just say a husband and wife are watching a movie together	26
8784	3443	It's great until a rather, inappropriate ,shall we say, scene comes on	27
8785	3443	Not only does it make things awkward, but it sends out the wrong message	28
8786	3443	When adults or unmarried people see their favorite actors being naughty on television, it makes it seem right	29
8787	3443	They start to lose the concept that you are supposed to remain abstinant until marriage	30
8788	3443	After all, it is the only way to remain free of any diseases	31
8789	3443	If movies, books, magazines, and music continue to be left uncensored, the world will become a giant brouhaha	32
8790	3443	People will begin to lose the sense of what is right and what is wrong	33
8791	3443	We are on the brink of violence and total chaos	34
8792	3443	If we contiue to let our children and ourselves watch these types of movies and whatnot,things will get ugly	35
8793	3443	Yes, if libraries or stores find anything offensive on their racks, then they need to censor it before it corrupts any more minds	36
8794	3444	I do not believe that movies, books, music, etc	0
8795	3444	should be removed from shelves	1
8796	3444	I believe that people are entitled to their own opinion about what they choose to listen to, read or watch, everybody has their own level of maturity	2
8797	3444	Parents who are concerned about their child watching/reading something, always have the right to tell them no, and to keep whatever it is out of their grasp	3
8798	3444	People are entitled to their own opinion on what is appropriate level material for themselves	4
8799	3444	Whether it is books, movies or music, a person always has the choice of whether or not they want to be in contact with that item	5
8800	3444	It is a good idea to keep more explicit things only for adults, but if it is supposed to be for a certain age level, it shoud be out for the choice to be up to that certain person	6
8801	3444	Different people have different levels of maturity, so it is hard for one person or company to say  what age level should or should not be using that material	7
8802	3444	A lot of parents will disagree with this issue, because they think that children should be kept away from the violence and vulgar images or language that are in the media these days	8
8803	3444	But at the same time, they fight for the right to raise their child the way they want to	9
8804	3444	People have the right to take away material that is too mature for their child, but no one should be able to say that someone else's child should not be able to view that material, because just because one person @MONTH1 find it offensive, does not mean that other people will	10
8805	3444	If someone should find something offensive they should have the common sense to not view that material any more, it's that simple	11
8806	3444	Everyone has that right so I do not think that companies have the right to take that away from them	12
8807	3444	Parents can censor what their children watch, and adults have the ability to make their own decisions about this topic	13
8808	3444	This proves that certain items, like books, movies, and music, should not be taken off the shelf.	14
8809	3445	I personally don't believe they should us censorship in libraries	0
8810	3445	I feel as though no one has the right to say people are or aren't allowed to enjoy certain material just because someone @MONTH1 thing that it is offensive because, thats just one persons opinion	1
8811	3445	What's one mens trash is another mens gold, what one person finds offensive could be sawt out by millions	2
8812	3445	Plus in todays world if everything was censored there would be nothing left not even church because everyone has there own opinion and there own belief	3
8813	3445	Which would eventually eliminate everything because there will always be at less one person who thinks something is offensive in someway, shape, or form	4
8814	3445	If everything was censored people wouldn't even be able to exspress themselfs	5
8815	3445	If cenorship was used everywhere schools wouldn't be able to teach half of the material they teach today and kid would have nothing to involved	6
8816	3445	Author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	7
8817	3445	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	8
8818	3445	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I for one completely agree with this quote	9
8819	3445	It's true as I have already stated if everything was cenored there be nothing left to be enjoyed	10
8820	3445	Think about it this way would you like someone telling you that your not allowed to read or listen to certain material just because someone felt as though it was offensive and thought it should be taken away from the public	11
8821	3445	I'm pretty sure that would make most people upset exspecially if they're a adult	12
8822	3445	I feel as though everyone has the right to choose what they read and listen to	13
8823	3445	So if you ever get asked if censorship in libraries should be allowed then think back to everything I've said before you give your answer	14
8824	3445	Once they start censoring what everyone can read and listen to then they'll feel as though they can censor any and everything and control peoples lives.	15
8825	3446	The quote that Katherine Paterson declairs a very strong point and is completely true in my eyes	0
8826	3446	Everyone thinks and functions differently so therefore something offensive to one person might be completely fair and good in anothers point of view	1
8827	3446	Everybody thinks different and as you go to school or work everyday you find that obvious by just about anything the person is doing or owns	2
8828	3446	For instance, their clothing	3
8829	3446	Belongings can show a lot about a person just as much as actions or words	4
8830	3446	So what do you think	5
8831	3446	Do you think that any material from the library should be taken off the shelf just because someone or a couple of people think its offensive or terrible	6
8832	3446	In my opinion, no	7
8833	3446	Every book, magazine or anything in the media can send out a different message in everyones personal thoughts	8
8834	3446	For example, one movie could touch someone in a very special way and at the same time, someone right next to them could think it's disguisting and cruel	9
8835	3446	I have actually had a real life situation were this has been a conflict	10
8836	3446	During the years of my seventh grade experience there was this playstation game that i loved to play and enjoyed playing every single day with all of my friends	11
8837	3446	My mother, and pretty much the entire @LOCATION1 found it very offensive	12
8838	3446	It was really awkward and annoying that one of the things i loved is something that they tried to ban and not allow it to be sold from local stores	13
8839	3446	Now being in my shoes how do you think that felt for me	14
8840	3446	I thought it didn't feel very fair at all, it's selfish and inconsiderate	15
8841	3446	That's like taking somebody possessions and telling them your opinion on them and then ditching them into the trash to rote and vanish forever	16
8842	3446	I believe that you should be able to read anything you would like in the library without the fear of your next favorite book being taking off of the shelf because a group of people protest from the language or whatever they think is offensive to them in the novel, because the next time you know it, everything will be gone from the shelves since everyone has different opinions	17
8843	3446	If you dont like the novel, then i assist you to return it, and to never read it again	18
8844	3446	I feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable	19
8845	3446	So what do you think as readers, is it fair to be able to read whatever you want or do you think if you or someone finds it offensive, you can take it off of the shelves?	20
8846	3447	Throughout the world, there are thousands of people with various opinions	0
8847	3447	If one person thinks an art piece looks unique, another @MONTH1 not see any true beauty	1
8848	3447	But when people hardly underdstand the concept of other people, they should not be exposed to books or movies that could be defined as offensive	2
8849	3447	Some people don't know @CAPS2 it is like to be truely offended	3
8850	3447	When I was in middle school, I was a shy, fragile, young girl	4
8851	3447	I had just moved to a new school and was petrified of my new surroundings	5
8852	3447	For the first couple of weeks, I felt like an outcast	6
8853	3447	like an outsider looking in	7
8854	3447	I didn't fit in with anyones' group	8
8855	3447	Everyone seemed to of already have friends for years and here I was, a new student with no friends to communicate with	9
8856	3447	I was isolated and was desperately trying to find someone to be my friend	10
8857	3447	I wondered if something was wrong with me	11
8858	3447	if I has a bad odor or was dressed in an out of style fashion	12
8859	3447	I tried buying new clothes and changing my hair color	13
8860	3447	It seemed as if I wasn't even noticed	14
8861	3447	Before I new it, school was half way over	15
8862	3447	I was still a nobody	16
8863	3447	Then @PERSON1 came along and made me a somebody	17
8864	3447	@PERSON1, who had just moved to my school, looked bold and confident	18
8865	3447	At first, people waved a friendly hello but nothing more	19
8866	3447	As I sat at my empty lunch table, @PERSON1 approached me and asked to sit down	20
8867	3447	I couldn't refuse the offer so I nodded a sincere yes	21
8868	3447	The entire lunch period, we sat talking	22
8869	3447	We had a lot in common and I was glad to have made a friendship with @PERSON1	23
8870	3447	Months went by before I realized @PERSON1 and I were great friends	24
8871	3447	I knew I could trust him with all of my secrets	25
8872	3447	Even though @PERSON1 and I were close, I felt as though @CAPS3 was always hiding something	26
8873	3447	Occasionally I would have enough courage to ask if there was anything @CAPS3 needed to tell me, but as the same as every answer before, it was a no	27
8874	3447	@PERSON1 and I had always walked to my house after school	28
8875	3447	But on one afternoon, something felt wrong	29
8876	3447	The air seemed to lingere for miles	30
8877	3447	We didn't talk until we got inside my house	31
8878	3447	Suddenly @PERSON1 spoke and said, '@CAPS1 are people so cruel?' I was shocked by this question for I didn't know how to respond	32
8879	3447	@PERSON1 sensed that I had no clue @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was talking about so @CAPS3 continued	33
8880	3447	'I'm gay.' I was appalled	34
8881	3447	Not because @CAPS3 was gay, but because @CAPS3 had never told me	35
8882	3447	I asked, '@CAPS2 happened?' @CAPS3 sat on the couch then and told me about how @CAPS3 was in the library overhearing some of our classmates reading a book about people making fun of gays'	36
8883	3447	I felt awful for @PERSON1	37
8884	3447	It wasn't his fault @CAPS3 was gay	38
8885	3447	I believe that certain books, movies, or music that are offensive to people should not be aloud on shelves	39
8886	3447	Some have never been offended	40
8887	3447	Some, always offend people for many reasons	41
8888	3447	Everyone has feelings and it hurts when they are offended	42
8889	3447	We, as a community, should love one another and respect them	43
8890	3447	Not read or listen to things that can hurt someones' inner feelings	44
8891	3448	Dear Newspaper,     I do indeed believe that certain books, magazines or any other form of redaing material should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive	0
8892	3448	I say this because, in every situation, either one side benefits, both sides benefit, or neither side benefits	1
8893	3448	If you do not want that article or piece of writing to be seen by certain audiences, then do not put it on a public display	2
8894	3448	It is best that they are in a solitare area for audiences mature enough to handle the influence and/ or consequences that go along with that type of material	3
8895	3448	I say influence, because studies and personal views have shown that teens and even young children are often influenced by explicit views portrayed by media	4
8896	3448	These children act in ways that reflect what they have seen	5
8897	3448	If they watch a movie full of violence, they @MONTH1 feel it is their job to act in violent manners	6
8898	3448	Until they reach an age of maturity and responsibility to make their own decisions, they let the outside world decide what is best	7
8899	3448	As a child is grows up, they are obligated to follow certain rules or take authoritative matters seriously	8
8900	3448	Authority teaches us, as children	9
8901	3448	We develop through our teachings and grow through our surroundings	10
8902	3448	You @MONTH1 ask what it is i am speaking about	11
8903	3448	Well, i believe that this situation relates to the phrase 'think before you speak' because it seems that the people displaying this media don't think about the after affects of their actions	12
8904	3448	Suggest that certain material @MONTH1 not only be impacting children and teens, but adults are highly affected as well	13
8905	3448	I am not speaking as though everyone who watches a movie or reads a book about a murderer will go out killing people	14
8906	3448	I am only saying that our surroundings almost make us who we are along with the way we were raised	15
8907	3448	The media gives us insight and ideas, in which sometimes revole around our every thought	16
8908	3448	I do believe that certain media, should be displayed in confidential locations	17
8909	3448	If not, then it should be a recommendation and obligation to have an age limit	18
8910	3448	My concern for public media display pertains to the concern of the impact on human lives	19
8911	3448	Thank you for your time	20
8912	3448	Sincerely,                 @LOCATION1	21
8913	3449	Many people find certain books, music, or magazines offensive or inappropriate for some young reads	0
8914	3449	Many people think that this material should be removed from libraries completely	1
8915	3449	People think that have young people exposed to this offensive material will effect the choices they make, and how they will react in certain situations	2
8916	3449	At the same time other people say that we should not remove it from the book shelves	3
8917	3449	They say that everyone has the right to read or listen to whatever he or she wants to	4
8918	3449	Its that persons right to choose weather or not it is age appropriate for them or not	5
8919	3449	Its not some elses right to take away choices that aren't theirs	6
8920	3449	People who belive that they should remove this material from libraries think it will corrupt young minds	7
8921	3449	They believe that this material will convey a message that it is alright to do what these books and music are saying	8
8922	3449	This in turn will create a different mind set for the young reader	9
8923	3449	Which @MONTH1 cause the young reader to be more aggresive or more like to make bad decisions about there well being or the well being of those around them	10
8924	3449	These people want there libraries to be about learning and be a healthy eviornment were young minds can grow naturaly and unharmed by offensive material	11
8925	3449	People who believe that they should leave this material on the shelf say its no one elses right to make this decison for you by removing them	12
8926	3449	Its the readers right to choose weather or not to read the material	13
8927	3449	The read will most likely learn what the material is saying regaurdless of weather it is in the library or not	14
8928	3449	They believe that it would be better for a young reader to learn about it in a safe enviornment then to have some one else later in there life show them or tell them	15
8929	3449	The enviornment maybe alot more dangerous then a library if learn though some one else	16
8930	3449	I believe in both in a way	17
8931	3449	I believe it is not some one elses right to remove these books from libraries	18
8932	3449	But i also believe that it should not be avalible for young readers to get	19
8933	3449	These books maybe be offensive to some people but its there choice to read it	20
8934	3449	They do not have to read these books it does not affect them	21
8935	3449	I believe the books not suitable for young readers should be placed on either a higher shelf or in a different part of the library where young readers do not have acsess to	22
8936	3449	If a readers parents want them to learn about it in a safe enviornment then they should sit there children down and explain it to them themselves	23
8937	3449	In the end we all have our rights and we use those to choice weather to read or listen to certain material	24
8938	3449	It is no one elses choice besides your own.	25
8939	3450	While their are many books written out thier @MONTH1 offened many types of people thier are some that just need to be wipped off the face of the earth, those who do not learn from history, are doomed to repeat it	0
8940	3450	That is one of my favorite quotes and i don't use it lightly	1
8941	3450	Take from example 'The @ORGANIZATION1' the very book that gives instructions to build bombs, teaches you how to use firearms etc	2
8942	3450	this book is all about hate amongst people we don't fully understand like thier religion and how they look	3
8943	3450	This book frankly makes me sick to the stomach	4
8944	3450	Thats why i think this book needs to be taken of the shelves for good, thier was alos hate properganda in the books about how the @CAPS1 shouldn't be alive and that's disgusting i would be able to sleep better at night knowing this book was gone	5
8945	3450	One other book that should be taken off the shelves is a book written by none other than one other @PERSON1 the man that put so many people into gas chambers and many others to thier undeserved graves	6
8946	3450	He sent men, women, and childeren to his many death camps and work camps	7
8947	3450	One of those many childern was @PERSON2 who was in hiding from the gustappo or '@CAPS2 @CAPS3'	8
8948	3450	Because of this monster the @CAPS7 lost one of the worlds greatest and most deappest writers for the @DATE1's	9
8949	3450	This book was filled with hate messages and how the @CAPS4 people shouldn't be allowed to live amongst the 'supposed' @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7	10
8950	3450	But if we did no have this book we would be sure to expect another @CAPS8 on our hands	11
8951	3450	All in all censorship in the libraries should be a rule but to only the books worth keeping not these horrific Books	12
8952	3451	The library is a public area where anyone can visit to find a book, movie, or magazine of their desire	0
8953	3451	Not everyone is interested in the same book genre	1
8954	3451	The library is meant to have almost any book someone could think of	2
8955	3451	If someone discovers a book or movie that offends them, they should not make a big deal about it	3
8956	3451	They should not be removed from the shelves of the library	4
8957	3451	I am against the removal of offensive entertainment because it is not fair to everyone else that is a member of the library	5
8958	3451	What if a group of adults enjoyed a movie that someone else thought was disturbing	6
8959	3451	If the library took that movie off of the shelves, they would lose business due to one person	7
8960	3451	If a mother of a six year old boy wanted to report an inappropiate movie to the librarian, it would not be fair to anyone that is mature enough for that movie	8
8961	3451	It just is not fair to everyone else	9
8962	3451	The library is public property	10
8963	3451	With that being said, it is the library's job to please the public's desires for entertainment	11
8964	3451	They are obligated to suppy books, movies, etc	12
8965	3451	for whomever	13
8966	3451	If one person does not like a particular book or magazine, they should search somewhere else for what they want	14
8967	3451	A few years back, my mom stopped taking my brother and I to the library	15
8968	3451	There were too many complaints about inappropiat books being supplied or taken off of the shelves	16
8969	3451	That year, the library lost @PERCENT1 of their customers because everytime the library tried pleasing them, someone else was not pleased	17
8970	3451	If every article of entertainment were to remain on the shelf in the library, everyone would be happy	18
8971	3451	If someone does not approve of a movie or something, they can search another shelf	19
8972	3451	Those who complain are only making more work for themselves.	20
8973	3452	Do you think that certain books should not be shared with certain poeple	0
8974	3452	In all honesty yes, let them read and listen to whatever they think is interesting	1
8975	3452	No matter what the content that the book or @CAPS1 contains it's their choice, there is a power called freedom in this world	2
8976	3452	One might think that if you are able to read and comprehend the words that are wrote in that book or sang in a song, then yes read and listen to anything you want	3
8977	3452	If a young person such as a kindergartener picks up a book about sex you know there is no way that child will be able to comprehend it	4
8978	3452	So yes any books should be left on the shelf at libraries, open to anyone and everyone who are willing to read them	5
8979	3452	Its not that you have to be mature enough to read a book its that you have to understand it and are able to read to get what the book is trying to say	6
8980	3452	Yes some things parents don't want their children to know, but this world is filled with awful things and they are bound to figure some of those horrible things out sooner or later	7
8981	3452	Reading and music lets you learn and experience different situations that you might have never been in before	8
8982	3452	Both books and songs are a way to express yourself and everyone should express theirself in some way	9
8983	3452	When it comes to movies that's a different story	10
8984	3452	Those movies are rated for a reason	11
8985	3452	On a rated @CAPS2 film i could see @NUM1 year olds on up watching it, because by then those kids have been in high school and everything sexual and perverted have been put into their little heads	12
8986	3452	Also most have been in sex education class	13
8987	3452	Blood and all things cruel have been talked about and heard about too	14
8988	3452	So yes let @NUM1 year olds on up watch rated @CAPS2 films	15
8989	3452	The one thing that isn't suggested is taking a little kid to see a film that isn't rated for them	16
8990	3452	Say a parent took a @NUM3 year old to see a scarry movie, more than likely that child is going to be scared and scarred from see blood, stabbing, and sexual content	17
8991	3452	Movies should be left rated for whom they should be rated for	18
8992	3452	When it comes to music and books, they are wonderful learning tools also good for expression of ones self	19
8993	3452	So learn, experience, and express	20
8994	3452	No matter what your interested in freedom was gave to you so use it	21
8995	3453	I enjoy reading very much so and I have read several books since I've been in highschool	0
8996	3453	Three of the best books I have read through my high school career were about drugs, rape, partying, and had innepropriate language in them	1
8997	3453	Some parents would not like their children reading those books and would ask for them to be taken out of our school library, but I think that is completely wrong	2
8998	3453	We have  freedom of speech and press so why can't those books be in our school libraries	3
8999	3453	What some parents think are offensive, others might not	4
9000	3453	Most of the time children disagree with their parents anyways so they are going to read whatever they want to read, or watch what they want, or even listen to what they want	5
9001	3453	People are different and we have a right to our own opinions	6
9002	3453	Some parents would say that those kinds of books should be taken out of the library but that's wrong, if you don't like them then don't read them, or discourage your kids from reading them	7
9003	3453	It's just a book, it's not like it's actually happening	8
9004	3453	Books are separated by age too, so a young child will be getting books from the children section so those books are for children and should be appropriate	9
9005	3453	Teenagers have a section too and they should be mature enough to handle what they read in books	10
9006	3453	I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from our libraries because a select few people think their offensive, that takes books away from people who enjoy reading those kinds of books	11
9007	3453	Then if all kinds of people are saying everything is offensive there will be no more books left on the shelf for people who don't think their offensive.When I am an adult I will tell my children what I expect from them and let them make their own choices because no matter what they will anyways and if they want to read a book with bad language in it, or a movie with language then so be it	12
9008	3453	It's not like they're actually doing what's going on in the book	13
9009	3453	Overall I think it is completely wrong for books to be removed from libraries for people complaining about them being offensive	14
9010	3455	Librarys have the right to diside how censored they want their material on their shelves to be	0
9011	3455	Much of this material @MONTH1 be considered offensive to certain people	1
9012	3455	However some materials @MONTH1 be as offensive to one perwson, it @MONTH1 not be offensive to another	2
9013	3455	Americans have freedom of speech, and writing, and many ohter rights	3
9014	3455	A library should have the right to put whatever materials it would like on to their shelves	4
9015	3455	There will always be offensive songs, books, movies, and magazines	5
9016	3455	Howver, some materials @MONTH1 be found offensive to someone, it @MONTH1 not be found offensive to others	6
9017	3455	A library @MONTH1 not be able to please everyone	7
9018	3455	'But if they have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work i abhor- then they also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	8
9019	3455	And we have no books on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson)	9
9020	3455	Paterson is simply explaining that if somone finds somthing offensive and wants it removed from a shelf then soon all books will be removed, and there will be nothing left at all on the shelves	10
9021	3455	A library is a place for everyone to come and find what they are looking for without any disterbances	11
9022	3455	A person probably isnt looking for somthing offensive	12
9023	3455	Therefore coming accross somthing that is offensive @MONTH1 be disterbing	13
9024	3455	however they should be able to try to ignore it	14
9025	3455	It is that persons choice to choose that library to attend to	15
9026	3455	So they will choose to maybe find offensive materials	16
9027	3455	If somone does not wish to come across offensive material they should choose not to go to the library	17
9028	3455	Americans have the right to be free, so does a library	18
9029	3455	If a person comes across a offinsive piece of material it should be ignored	19
9030	3455	A library can not please everyone by taking out all of it merchandice that @MONTH1 be considerd offensive	20
9031	3455	There simply would be nothin left	21
9032	3455	People should be aware that they @MONTH1 come across some offensive materials when going in to a library, so it will allways be the peoples choice of attending that library	22
9033	3456	I believe that some materail should be remove if very offensive	0
9034	3456	I also believe that if its helping you learn then it should stay on the shelf	1
9035	3456	Everyone, has different thoughts about was is offensive or apropreate and whats not	2
9036	3456	Also, everyone has different ideas or expectations on if books,music,movies,magazines, and so on are apropreate	3
9037	3456	Each person should read the cover of the book and so on to see if it will be apropreate for them.And the liabary should put warning stickers on  the book, so that person knows the graphic or voulgur language	4
9038	3456	Therefore, I beleive that the laibaries should put warning signs on anything to reduce less books being removed from the shelfs	5
9039	3456	And so forth my decision is to not remove certain materail, only if offensive	6
9040	3456	The liabaries should use warning stickers on books so that person knows ahead of time about the graphic or voulgur language	7
9041	3456	I believe this will help and reduce the problems in our liabaries	8
9042	3456	Even thought alot of people will dis agree, this is what I believe should happen	9
9043	3456	Heres why I believe this should happen	10
9044	3456	One day when I was younger just starting to read I came across a book	11
9045	3456	I was reading it to my mother then she takes the book away and gives it to the liabarean and told what happen	12
9046	3456	I guess I said a very inapropeate word and they had no idea the book had that kind of language in it	13
9047	3456	So, now everytime my mother takes my younger brothers to the liabary she makes sure the book they want are apropeate for there age group so the same incadent wont happen again.wouldnt you be the same way with your children	14
9048	3456	I know I would not just for my kids but for other children also	15
9049	3457	In today's world being a child isn'@CAPS1 the easy thing, they have ideas and thoughts racing through our mind constantly, weather it is the stress of school or what there doing this @DATE1	0
9050	3457	But the last thought a child would have is if the literature their reading is offensive or not	1
9051	3457	I do not think that cencorship should be enforced more than it already is	2
9052	3457	Although that parents, and the government would disagree, cencorship is going to do nothing but make out future children more close minded and sheltered than they already are	3
9053	3457	Children shouldn'@CAPS1 lose their innocence so soon but they shouldn'@CAPS1 be so nieve about the world either	4
9054	3457	So I'm against censorship, because it's not going to accomplish anything but make children more sheltered	5
9055	3457	Censorship is already posted on music and movies, and it's not doing anything children are still goint to listening to music that isn'@CAPS1 appropriate for their age, but they don'@CAPS1 know the meaning behind the lyrics	6
9056	3457	And cencoring movies and @CAPS1.V show aren'@CAPS1 going to help much either, because of the internet it has made it easier for teens and children to access thing more easily	7
9057	3457	So unless we censore the internet to certian	8
9058	3457	Which nobody wants that to happen then we have to let our children be more open to the public world, because they will find out about certian thing sooner or later	9
9059	3457	Censorship is going to shape how our world operates eventually, but it doesnt have to	10
9060	3457	If parents just sat down with their children more and talked to them about certian then cersorship wouldn'@CAPS1 be needed	11
9061	3458	Hello	0
9062	3458	My name is @PERSON1	1
9063	3458	I am writting to you @DATE1 because their is so much conflict on the issue of 'if materials in the library are offensive should they be removed from their shelves'	2
9064	3458	I know their are people that will agree or disagree but what i think they should do is leave them	3
9065	3458	Yes i said it they should stay wright where they are	4
9066	3458	People all over this world get themselves worked up over all the little things in life but what we dont understand is their is always gonna be something in life we dont like and thats never going to change	5
9067	3458	Like this for example, people taking offense to materials in the library and wonting them to be removed	6
9068	3458	I mean come on people wake up and realize you are not always going to have things as you wont them theirs always going to be things you just have to deal with it	7
9069	3458	I believe that these types of materials should stay wright where their at because people can over look them we just decied not to	8
9070	3458	We all make a big deal over something so small	9
9071	3458	People should just not look at it and move on dont sit their and fuss about it just turn around and walk away just because you dont like it dosent mean that others dont	10
9072	3458	Everybody in this world needs to see that their are things were not going to like but we have to get over them and move on	11
9073	3458	This will always happen and theirs nothing we can do about it	12
9074	3458	All over the universe people @MONTH1 agree or disagree with what i have to say but its your perspective and what you think about it is your choice	13
9075	3458	I  will say though that they should stay but people need to get over themselves and see the truth in life and know that even though their are things we dont like dont sit their and argue about it just leave it and go your own way	14
9076	3458	So this is my essay to you	15
9077	3458	People need to see their always not going to get what they want in life but they need to move on	16
9078	3458	Like this if you have a problem with the things around you such as taking offense to materials in the library and wonting them removed well sorry but no	17
9079	3458	learn to walk away from it because what you like @MONTH1 not be what others like and what they like @MONTH1 not be what you like we just have to go on with life leave it be because others oppinons @MONTH1 not match yours 	18
9080	3458	Leave the materials alone because we as people need to see where not always going to get our way in life and to take hold of learning how to blow it off instead of making a big deal about something so little we could of walked away from	19
9081	3459	I do not believe that books should be censored	0
9082	3459	I believe that if it is on the shelf then anyone can pick it up	1
9083	3459	The books at the library are on a shelf and little kids grab them everyday so why cant they read them if there in their sight	2
9084	3459	I've gone in libraries plenty of times and in all my experiences I have never come across an offensive book	3
9085	3459	If the books are offensive I believe that they would not put the books out for everyone to see	4
9086	3459	All the times I go to the Libraries I have never come across a book that was offensive	5
9087	3459	I think that if they allow some commericials to be put on television then why can't some books be put on display.I believe that reading sharpens the mind and if a kid picks up an adult but who are we to say no you can not read that	6
9088	3459	The Libraries should not watch what they put out on the shelves because if you believe you should not read that certain book you would not pick it up in the first place	7
9089	3459	If your child picks up a book that you dont want them to read then you should not have taken him in the store in the first place	8
9090	3459	If you do not like the music selection that the libraries have then go to a different store	9
9091	3459	The libraries have bigger issues to worry about then your personal taste of music	10
9092	3459	If you do not like certain magazines that they have then order magazines online	11
9093	3459	There is no reason why you shopuld have any compliants to a library the library is a place to help you	12
9094	3459	It is no mandatory to go to one if you do not like what they have then do not to the library	13
9095	3459	Those are some valid points on why I believe that books, magazines, movies, and etc	14
9096	3459	should not be censored	15
9097	3459	If you dont like the movies they have don't go to the library	16
9098	3459	If you think their magazines are inapproapriate then order magazines online	17
9099	3459	If you don't like there books then order online or go to a book store	18
9100	3459	That is why I believe books should not be censored.	19
9101	3460	As many would agree, censorship is a growing topic of concern throughout the world	0
9102	3460	I personally feel that censorship is necessary to a certain extent	1
9103	3460	If one feels the content of music, a movie, or a book is questionable, he or she has the option of reading, listening, or watching	2
9104	3460	Among many deabted materials, movies have ratings, just as music has 'bleeps'	3
9105	3460	Movies are rated '@CAPS1' for all audiences, '@CAPS2' standing for parental guidence, '@NUM1' for parental guidence for ages @NUM2 and older, and lastly '@CAPS3' meaning that anyone under the age of @NUM3 is either suggested or required to have an adult present during the viewing of the film	4
9106	3460	At home, the ratings are all based on the parent's preference	5
9107	3460	At the movie theatre, the restrictions become a sort of law	6
9108	3460	Anyone below the age of thirteen is not permitted to see a movie that is '@NUM1' or '@CAPS3' unless accompanied by an adult (anyone @NUM5 or older)	7
9109	3460	Anyone who isn't @NUM3 or older @MONTH1 not enter a movie rated '@CAPS3' unless accompanied by someone @NUM7 or older	8
9110	3460	Depending on where you are, the restrictions @MONTH1 be more or less harsh	9
9111	3460	Ultimately, the rating system is intended to force parents to choose what is and isn't appropriate for their child	10
9112	3460	As for music on the radio, all 'curse words' are 'bleeped' out	11
9113	3460	If a person wants to buy their own music, artists are required to make two of the same album, one with censors and one without	12
9114	3460	Thus creating a decision usually for the parents, usually assuming they are the ones to but the album or the music for their child	13
9115	3460	When it comes to books, there are no ratings, just genres letting the reader know who the author's intended audience is	14
9116	3460	Types of genres include 'adult', 'young adult' and 'children' sections in libraries and book stores	15
9117	3460	Just like music and television, the final choice in the purchase is all dependent on the parents	16
9118	3460	Even though many restrictions put in place, there are still some faults to the system	17
9119	3460	Obviously if you are @NUM2 or younger, you most likely won't have identification	18
9120	3460	This leaves the person working at the movie theatre the option to let in who they believe to be of age	19
9121	3460	Looks @MONTH1 be decieving	20
9122	3460	Buying music from the internet doesn't require any type of identification either	21
9123	3460	How can they prove your age	22
9124	3460	When purchasing a book, not many cashieers would stop a child and say, 'that's innappropriate for you'	23
9125	3460	Maybe kids of all ages should have identification	24
9126	3460	Although these are all underlying problems in the censorship system, it seems to all lead back to the parents	25
9127	3460	Censorship is a huge topic of discussion for the parents of today's young and growing society, but in reality, if they have an issue with the content, they themselves will either rid of the material or prohibit the use and or puchase of it	26
9128	3460	All in all, it's about the parents and their personal preference	27
9129	3461	No books should be taken off the shelf	0
9130	3461	Most people have different taste in books, magazines or movies	1
9131	3461	If people find one of those offensive, then why can't they ignore it	2
9132	3461	They can go find a different one	3
9133	3461	Not everyone should have the same taste as one person, thats what makes the person we are today	4
9134	3461	If everyone had the same taste in everything this would be a pretty boring world.I'm more into horror novels more than anything	5
9135	3461	My own opinion, I think they have alot of excitement	6
9136	3461	with the killing and what not	7
9137	3461	I'm also not a big fan of reading, I read when I absolutely have nothing to do.Its very hard to move onto a different series of novels	8
9138	3461	Such as: romance, horror, adventures, even poetry!It takes alot to understand poetry	9
9139	3461	Poetry has alot of big descriptive words	10
9140	3461	@PERSON1 for instance, he's one of my favorite poets	11
9141	3461	he's actually pretty famous for what all he has done	12
9142	3461	Well, he didn't become famous until after his death.Overall, not everyone has the same taste in books, magazines, movies or even poetry	13
9143	3461	We're all different even when it comes to this.	14
9144	3463	I think they should'nt remove material from libraries if it's found offensive	0
9145	3463	People find different things offensive that others do not	1
9146	3463	If you started takeing these things out,thers a good possibility that you'll loose everything,books and your people	2
9147	3463	One example I say this is because, some people are offensive bout movies that have violent scense in them	3
9148	3463	Others like the violence in those shows	4
9149	3463	The librarie might be the only way someone can get ahold of something they like	5
9150	3463	Another example is, magazines can contain material you don't want your kids round or seeing	6
9151	3463	That same magazine could help a student with a assignment at school	7
9152	3463	Kids might need the material that is offensive,it could help them through life	8
9153	3463	In conclusion I do not think we should take movies and books out if someone finds it offnesive	9
9154	3463	Some of the offensive material could be used to help students in there education	10
9155	3463	Other offensive material some adults enjoy reading or watching	11
9156	3463	Just because one person finds something offensive does not mean the next person that comes in will.	12
9157	3464	Do people have the right to limit freedom	0
9158	3464	Do people have the right to limit imagination	1
9159	3464	Do people have the right to limit self expression	2
9160	3464	Many people in today's world think so	3
9161	3464	Book  censorship is a big deal in the world today	4
9162	3464	Weather books deemed 'offensive' should be taken out of libraries or not is a serious issue	5
9163	3464	Censoring books not only limits self expression but it also limits knowledge and our constitutional right of free speech	6
9164	3464	I believe people should not be able to censor books	7
9165	3464	Censoring a book is like putting a limit on human imagination	8
9166	3464	All through life people are urged to think outside of the box	9
9167	3464	We are told as kids that being unique and diffrent is a good thing	10
9168	3464	We are all told this and yet when writers express themselfs in books, the same people that told them to think outside of the box, want to censor their thoughts	11
9169	3464	By censoring books, we are telling the world that imagination is a bad thing	12
9170	3464	Many people want to censor books so their children can not read 'offensive' matterial	13
9171	3464	They feel that by taking books they feel to be 'offensive' out of libraries, they can sheild their child from the bad things in the world	14
9172	3464	This is not the case	15
9173	3464	People @MONTH1 be able to censor books, but no one can censor life	16
9174	3464	Children will learn 'offensive' things with or without  books	17
9175	3464	Book censorship limits knowledge	18
9176	3464	At the time it was written, The @CAPS1's of @PERSON1, was a very scandels book	19
9177	3464	Because of the laungauge this book used, many people thought it was trash	20
9178	3464	Many people wanted it to be censored	21
9179	3464	Today The @CAPS1's of @ORGANIZATION1 is a famous and classic book	22
9180	3464	In fact, I was required to read it for school	23
9181	3464	Regardless of the language this book used, it shows a part of @CAPS3 history	24
9182	3464	And to think, if people back then would have removed it form the libraries, I most likely would never have read this book, and I would never have the knowledge I gained from reading this book	25
9183	3464	It is our constitutional right to write and read the books we choose	26
9184	3464	America was built on the idea of freedom	27
9185	3464	Under the constitution we are garentied freedom of speech	28
9186	3464	By taking books out of libraries, we are limiting our freedom of speech	29
9187	3464	No one should be alowed to tell you that you can't read a book you want to read	30
9188	3464	No one should be alowed to tell you that you can't write a book as you want to write it	31
9189	3464	If we start censoring books, writers will be forced to censor their personal thoughts	32
9190	3464	Making writers do that, limits thier freedom of speech	33
9191	3464	If freedom of speech is limited, what other freedoms will also be limited with the years to come	34
9192	3464	Book censorship and censorship in gernal, is not a good thing	35
9193	3464	all it does is limit things	36
9194	3464	If we start censoring books, we are giving a messege to our children, that diffrent is bad	37
9195	3464	If freedom of speech is limited, how long will it be untill our other rights are limited	38
9196	3464	Where will it end	39
9197	3464	Before removing even the first book from the shelf, we need to ask ourselvees this, do we have the right to limit freedom	40
9198	3465	In my own personal opinion this letter to the newspaper with my views on censorship in libraries is that I think music, books, magizines, and etc should be stayed on the shelves	0
9199	3465	If they can get illistrated they should be able to be read or listened to	1
9200	3465	The things in this paragraph will be about the content of music,books, magizines, and etc	2
9201	3465	The music industry too many people think some songs are innapropriate but really that ruins the whole point of the whole entire song	3
9202	3465	Maybe it could be age adviced but thats all they should do they should not cut down the content	4
9203	3465	The magizines should be read or looked at by anyone because they are illistrated books	5
9204	3465	They should be aloud anywere if they got illistrated	6
9205	3465	Movies should be put in the library with age advice because someone had to allow that movie to go out in theatres, @CAPS1, or on the @CAPS2	7
9206	3465	From my experience I have seen people complain about these things	8
9207	3465	I really do not get why you should complain about these things	9
9208	3465	Now you decide what your views are on censorship in libraries	10
9209	3466	What is censorship	0
9210	3466	Cenorship can be described as limitations or restrictions, and it can aslo be called common courtsy	1
9211	3466	The real question is what are we limiting	2
9212	3466	Censorship is not something to support	3
9213	3466	Censorship to a book is like chocolate cake without the chocolate, its taking away the value and fun out of education	4
9214	3466	Though many @MONTH1 disapprove, libraries shouldn't censor their books, movies, or music because of that	5
9215	3466	Some @MONTH1 find that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON1' are offensive books because of their repeated use of the '@CAPS4' word	6
9216	3466	There is also some arguement to that, there are several @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that I know that find the '@CAPS4' word offensive, but not in this case	7
9217	3466	They say that it brings more educational value to the book, because in the day of @PERSON1 the '@CAPS4' word was an excepted word	8
9218	3466	Thats just how it was back then	9
9219	3466	Back then and now censorship is hiding reality	10
9220	3466	People who write, sing, and direct things that are considerd 'inapropriate' are the ones who are trying to set the truth free	11
9221	3466	The 'inapropriate' language, or experiences are the ones that really happen and are the words that are really said	12
9222	3466	By using censorship you are sheltering the world	13
9223	3466	Cesorship is tool we use to block ourselves from reality	14
9224	3466	Is that the right choice	15
9225	3466	Is it right sending sheltered teens out in the world unable to fend for themselves	16
9226	3466	Or should we let them understand how it really works	17
9227	3467	Censorship    'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other chldren have taken off the shef	0
9228	3467	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -that work I abhor -then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
9229	3467	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 was quoted from an author named Katherine Paterson	2
9230	3467	I don't believe certain materials such as books should be removed from shelves under any circumstances	3
9231	3467	Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about certain materials	4
9232	3467	If books are removed from the shelves due to censorship, than what is the point of writing or even reading books	5
9233	3467	If people continue to remove books because they're found to be offensive, then there won't be any books left to read	6
9234	3467	I have seen many offensive books	7
9235	3467	Whether it had something to do with religious beliefs or even revealing too much sexual content, I'm sure it's offensive to someone somewhere	8
9236	3467	Books are written by authors who believe they have the right to express themselves through writing	9
9237	3467	If you are to take away or ban a certain book from the shelf, than what would the author who wrote the book think	10
9238	3467	@CAPS1 world is full of offensive and rather disturbing books	11
9239	3467	It can't be right to just get rid of those things because they bother us	12
9240	3467	Everyone has the right to read any book they want to	13
9241	3467	Just because it offends one person, doesn't mean it offends everyone	14
9242	3467	I believe censorship is unnessesary	15
9243	3467	What gives anyone the right to remove or change something because it's inappropriate	16
9244	3467	I have personally read a few books that I wouldn't want little kids to read but that doesn't mean I should remove it from the shelves	17
9245	3467	Perhaps, somebody else has been waiting to find that book	18
9246	3467	If I did remove it than I'm restricting others from experiencing the joys of reading that book	19
9247	3467	Censorship in general is wrong	20
9248	3467	Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and different ways of expressing themselves	21
9249	3467	I don't believe anyone has the right to take something, that someone has worked on for so long to make, and remove it because they find it offensive	22
9250	3467	There will always be something out there that you won't approve of	23
9251	3467	Just because you don't approve of it doesn't mean everybody doesn't approve	24
9252	3467	Authors write books for a reason, musicians write music for a reason, people make movies and magazines for a reason	25
9253	3467	What gives anyone the right to take something that somebody made and ban it from the rest of the world because it's offensive	26
9254	3467	Books are there to help us become more educated and more open minded towards different thoughts and ideas	27
9255	3467	We shouldn't just ban them because they offend certain people	28
9256	3467	If you don't like a book because it offends you, than don't read it	29
9257	3467	It's just that simple	30
9258	3467	If people continue to remove books because they're offensive, then there won't be any books left to read.	31
9259	3468	If someone is looking for an offensive book, they are going to find it, whether it's collecting dust on a library shelf or is brand new in a book store	0
9260	3468	The same goes for an offensive @CAPS1, magazine, or movie	1
9261	3468	Removing the offensive items from library shelves will only cause the people searching for these items to look elsewhere	2
9262	3468	Different people have different opinions on what is offensive and what is not offensive	3
9263	3468	The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is an example of a controversial book that many people believed to be offensive to their religious beliefs	4
9264	3468	While many people found The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 offensive, others enjoyed the story	5
9265	3468	If the book had been removed from libraries because some people found it offensive, then others who really enjoyed the book would not have been able to read it	6
9266	3468	Another reason libraries should not remove offensive items from their shelves is that, most likely, the entire book, magazine, movie, etc	7
9267	3468	is not offensive the whole way through	8
9268	3468	Even if a movie has one offensive scene in it, the rest of the movie could be a great story that many people would benefit from seeing	9
9269	3468	It is the same idea with a book or magazine	10
9270	3468	There @MONTH1 be a few offensive chapters or one or two offensive articles, but very rarely will you find a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive the whole way through	11
9271	3468	Of course, there are still offensive items that would be bad for younger kids to see even with the one or two offensive scenes, chapters, or article	12
9272	3468	There are easier solutions to this problem than having to remove the items from the shelves completely	13
9273	3468	One solution to this problem could be for libraries to put age limits on certain items, so that younger kids can't check out materials that are too innapropriate	14
9274	3468	But more importantly, this would be the job of the parents to monitor what their kids are reading, watching, or listening to	15
9275	3468	Removing offensive books, magazines, music, and movies from the shelves of libraries would just cause more problems and complaints	16
9276	3468	I think it is a good idea to leave the material on the library shelves and caution library users to 'read at their own risk.'	17
9277	3469	Censorship in school libraries is important, but at the same time it is not necessary	0
9278	3469	I believe that many books in the school library are not apropriate for younger children, but these same books should not be taken out of our libraries becuase I feel like high schoolers are mature enough to be reading this material	1
9279	3469	The material in this books are no differnt than what goes on in the high school years	2
9280	3469	Most of these books give a prospective on real life stories and @MONTH1 be able to help someone cope and realize that they are not alone	3
9281	3469	At the same time though many of these books do contain curse words, some sexual scenes, partying, drinking, and doing drugs	4
9282	3469	These books are too old for a elementary school age child and maybe even a middle school age child to be reading	5
9283	3469	For example the books by @PERSON1, these books are about a girl who becomes addicted to drugs, pregant, in jail, and homeless	6
9284	3469	I read these books, they are really good books, and they showed me how by just trying one drug, one time, could ruin your whole life	7
9285	3469	I learned a lot from these books, but I don't think that anyone younger than fourteen should be reading them	8
9286	3469	There should be a limit on the censorship	9
9287	3469	Many things talked about in the books, are the same things talked about in the school hallways, what is the difference	10
9288	3469	That is why authors write about the things they do, so they can conect with teenagers	11
9289	3469	Many books are an authors experience, so they are meant for high school age	12
9290	3469	Many authors will put an age level on their books, like fourteen and older	13
9291	3469	Librabries should pay attention to these ratings before putting the books in the libraries	14
9292	3469	Someone @MONTH1 become offened by what they read in a book, but I don't think that book should be taken off the shelf becuase of one person	15
9293	3469	If it becomes a bigger issue, than yes it should be taken off, but at the same time, that one book @MONTH1 be someone else's way from escaping the hardships in their life	16
9294	3469	Many adults would disagree with my statements becuase they feel like if a teenager is reading about someone drinking, do drugs, or having sex, then they are more likely to do those things	17
9295	3469	I feel like this is not true becuase the book I am reading now, they are partying and drinking, but I'm not out doing that	18
9296	3469	What is the differnce between someone reading it in a book and seeing it on television	19
9297	3469	I see many worse things on the @LOCATION1 than I read in books	20
9298	3469	Parents should be happy that their teenager is reading and not playing video games or out with friends	21
9299	3469	These are just my oppinons, some people @MONTH1 agree with me and others @MONTH1 disagree, but I am going to stick with my oppinons	22
9300	3470	Censorship in Libraries	0
9301	3470	Censorship is a big conflict in many libraries	1
9302	3470	@CAPS2 are plenty of offensive books that shouldn't be put on the shelves	2
9303	3470	Many schools call these books, magazines, and movies, '@CAPS1.'  @CAPS2 is often a week where people read all of the books that have been @CAPS1 from school libraries	3
9304	3470	I participate in this school wide challenge beacause I disagree with banning books	4
9305	3470	Banning books can be good and also very hurtful in many reasons	5
9306	3470	First off, I like to think of banning books or anything else from the author or writers view	6
9307	3470	How would you feel if you spent around @NUM1 years writing this story/movie for kids that got @CAPS1 in the first couple of weeks it was on the shelves	7
9308	3470	I don't think that many people would enjoy that	8
9309	3470	I also think that many people don't think of authors at that big of a deal	9
9310	3470	When I think of that it makes me think of all the things we couldn't read in our world	10
9311	3470	Including, newspapers, books, and magizines	11
9312	3470	Maybe even include the fact that it takes a lot of work to write the things on what people want to hear, or see	12
9313	3470	I feel like when books or movies get @CAPS1 or removed, it makes the author feel like they're worth nothing	13
9314	3470	The parents point of view makes things a lot worse	14
9315	3470	Think of it this way, your child comes home from school with this book that he/she wants you to read with him	15
9316	3470	You sit down and start reading, when suddenly you come across a violent or inappropriate secne in the story	16
9317	3470	You stop reading all of a sudden and look at your child who is enjoying this violence and loving this story	17
9318	3470	What do you do	18
9319	3470	Many parents would call the school and explain what happened and complain about banning this book and taking it away from children that could get this book	19
9320	3470	Taking it away has no point because just banning it from the school library doesn't mean that they can't find it elsewhere	20
9321	3470	How do you think your child would feel having loved this story now it's gone	21
9322	3470	I know that it would make me feel like I did something wrong	22
9323	3470	Taking things off shelves also has a good side to it	23
9324	3470	When you take the book, movie or magizine off the shelf it is gone forever from that library	24
9325	3470	This can be a good thing because then kids won't have the obvious reason to get the story	25
9326	3470	If you don't want your child or other children to see it then it is quite a good idea	26
9327	3470	It makes the @CAPS1 object harder to find and also harder for the kids to grab intrest to	27
9328	3470	If the book or movie isn't around then they won't want to read the next one or see the next movie	28
9329	3470	@CAPS2 are many different views on censorship, which could effect how people choose what happens in libraries	29
9330	3470	My view on this topic was negitive and I support that fully	30
9331	3470	If the author works hard on writing the story they shouldn't get punished for expressing their feelings in a story	31
9332	3470	Many different poeple come across this issue and @CAPS2 are many different views on the topic	32
9333	3470	Next @CAPS1 book week I'll be supporting the authors that got crushed by their work getting @CAPS1	33
9334	3470	I hope that you will too.	34
9335	3471	Censorship in public libraries, allowed	0
9336	3471	I believe it should be, with a few different veiw points	1
9337	3471	For one, why should the books come off of shelves because some people do not like the plot of the series	2
9338	3471	Two, @CAPS1 is over a million of us people out @CAPS1 and we all are not a like in many ways	3
9339	3471	Also @CAPS2, reading is one of those things that we differ with each other	4
9340	3471	One person might read peaceful warm-hearted stories, than you have people out @CAPS1 like want something more intense to be able to read	5
9341	3471	With all of us being different all over the world	6
9342	3471	Humans have different taste in food, music, movies, and books	7
9343	3471	All people have different ways to satisfy their pleasures in book readings, to me books are like religons not all of us are the same in that, and at the same time we are all freely living with our reglion without any punichment, so why would you take away books that people love to read freely	8
9344	3471	To me, in my eyes is just not right	9
9345	3471	It's like taking candy away from a innocent baby because it will rot it's teeth out	10
9346	3471	What I mean by that is, that sure some books to people @MONTH1 offend them yet their might be some people out @CAPS1 being offensive to that persons books and so on, but as all as your baby's teeth aren't rotting out, than why take the candy away	11
9347	3471	Meaning if the books have each individal shelf with labels on what it was all about, which they do	12
9348	3471	People wouldn't feel so offensive finding them in the wrong spot	13
9349	3471	Looking at the point of veiws do you understand where I come from with this	14
9350	3471	We are all the same, yet in books we find each other inside of them, finding ourselves into books, I know many book readers with different types of tastes	15
9351	3471	No matter who they were and who their friends were, we all are different	16
9352	3471	To many people other than myself, would agree with that	17
9353	3471	So tell me again why should censorship not be in public libraries	18
9354	3474	Can books, music, movies, and other materials be perfect for everyone	0
9355	3474	Everyone has their own oppinion and beliefs on what materials are good, and what are not acceptable for the human minds	1
9356	3474	All over the world young kids, young adults, and adults are reading books, magazines, listening to music, and watching movies	2
9357	3474	Those are all hobbies most people enjoy doing	3
9358	3474	Everyone reads different kind of books, whether its mystery, romance, or bible based books, people read	4
9359	3474	Removing books, magazines, and other materials off the shelves in a library leads to an unsuccessful empty library	5
9360	3474	When people come and search for a book to read, they search for what they think they will enjoy	6
9361	3474	If they enjoy one thing, another person might not	7
9362	3474	They might find a book offensive, but does that mean everyone else is offensive by the book as well	8
9363	3474	Taking that book out leaves the person who would enjoy that book stuck searching for another book	9
9364	3474	Everyone is different, everyone has their own story, just like these books do	10
9365	3474	Magazines are like books, they are meant to be enjoyed	11
9366	3474	I believe some magazines might not be appropriate for some people, But that doesn't mean they should take it off the shelf	12
9367	3474	It means that person should simply not read it	13
9368	3474	Magazines are made for all people to enjoy, that's why there are so many different kinds	14
9369	3474	They want to fit each magazine personally to each individual	15
9370	3474	Music is the number one entertainment people enjoy	16
9371	3474	There is a reason why there is so many different genres	17
9372	3474	The music industry try their best to sort the music to your taste	18
9373	3474	Just because one song has stuff in it you don't like doesn't mean you can delete that song from everyone	19
9374	3474	Music is used for many different ways	20
9375	3474	It relaxes you, pumps you up, it is used for parties, events, and so many other things	21
9376	3474	All songs are different so you can use them however you want	22
9377	3474	To band music because someone doesn't like it, changes music forever	23
9378	3474	There would be no music to listen to	24
9379	3474	People should be able to watch what movies they want	25
9380	3474	That's why there are ratings on movies	26
9381	3474	What is acceptable for teenagers, but not be acceptful for young kids	27
9382	3474	That's why they should not watch it	28
9383	3474	If people banned all the movies they thought were inapropriate	29
9384	3474	There would be no rented movie stores, theaters, or success in the movie production industry	30
9385	3474	Everyone should know what kind of movies they like, and they should just watch what they like, and leave the other movies for the people who enjoy it	31
9386	3474	No, books, magazines, movies, and music can not be perfect for everyone	32
9387	3474	Materials bring all different kind of subjects, and stories for everyone	33
9388	3474	Each materials brings enjoyment to different people	34
9389	3474	To band all the materials you believe is inappropriate will leave the shelves empty	35
9390	3474	What kind of library is that	36
9391	3476	Dear newspaper,     In my opinion I don't think that censorship in libraries should be on materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines and more materials	0
9392	3476	Censoring materials in the library could resolve in many problems	1
9393	3476	I don't agree with the censorship in libraries on materials for many reasons	2
9394	3476	In my upcoming paragraphs, I will explain why I diagree with libraries having censorship on a lot of their materials	3
9395	3476	Many libraries in the world @MONTH1 have censoring on their materials	4
9396	3476	I believe that libraries have alot of censoring on most of their materials due to the fact that they @MONTH1 have children under the age of eighteen constantly viewing a lot of explicent content	5
9397	3476	Libraries shouldn't censor their materials but in my opinion they also shouldn't let under age children check out any kind of material that is only ment to be viewed by adults	6
9398	3476	Also if computer access is offered to children, an adult superior visor should be near by to make sure that no explicent content is being viewed	7
9399	3476	Censoring in libraries could resolve in many problems, such as, customers not getting all the information they need for a centain material, children not reading up to their abilities or standards, and also children not learning enough or getting information that they need for school	8
9400	3476	If all of these things happen prior to the fact that libraries have censors on their materials then many libraries will not get as any customers	9
9401	3476	Yes, most people @MONTH1 visit libraries for the wrong reasons but to other people, those wrong reasons @MONTH1 be the reason for them to gain more information	10
9402	3476	Materials in a library could also be found offensive to most people	11
9403	3476	But what's found offensive to most people could be found useful to other people	12
9404	3476	If something is found offensive to one person I don't think it should be removed from the shelves	13
9405	3476	If books and or materials are removed from the shelves, that can hide so much useful information that people could gain	14
9406	3476	In conclusion, I don't think censorship should be put on materials in libraries due to the fact that many information could be lost	15
9407	3476	Censorship doesn't always mean that the material is bad, it can also mean that the material is just not appropreite to be viewed or read by that certain age group	16
9408	3476	If a library that I visit has censoring on most of their materials, I would convince the library staff to take the censoring off	17
9409	3476	Censoring is not always bad and it's not always good either but it can hide alot of information from us which is not good at all.	18
9410	3479	A library is a place to go and find books, music, and other things	0
9411	3479	It's a big resource 	1
9412	3479	it has a huge variety of help for people	2
9413	3479	Question is , is everything that you can have access to be removed from shelves if there found offensive	3
9414	3479	If books, music , or anythingelse on the shelves were found offensive they should be removed off the shelves	4
9415	3479	They should have a section for those certain kind of materials	5
9416	3479	To accsess  that certain material you would have to have a librarians permission that way it can't come off offensive to anyone	6
9417	3479	Your probably asking why you couldn't leave it on the shelf	7
9418	3479	You can't just leave it on the shelf because it could be offensive to someones cultural beliefs or seem inappropriate to the youth	8
9419	3479	So therefore thats why they would have to be removed	9
9420	3479	I do believe they should be remooved for those various reasons	10
9421	3479	Libraries are a place to go to be used as recources or fun	11
9422	3479	Everyone who goes to a library should have everything to there needs.	12
9423	3480	Is it understandable to have some books restricted to people because of their age	0
9424	3480	No it is not the whole situation of wether or not libraries should have things such as movies, books, and cds restricted to certain people due to there age should not be an issue	1
9425	3480	My reasoning on that is not because of how it @MONTH1 influence people in a bad way	2
9426	3480	Then again it @MONTH1 influence them in a fantastic way	3
9427	3480	Thats how people find out who they are such as, what their interested in, what they like, and what they want to do	4
9428	3480	If it wasnt for establishments such as libraries most people would be the same as the others and not have a sense of character to themselves	5
9429	3480	People would be to similar and have little to no differences to themselves from others	6
9430	3480	People should be aware of some of the content in books	7
9431	3480	Just not to the point were those areas become restricted to certain age groups	8
9432	3480	Movies and cds are more understandable do to the actual graphic violence and language that some musicans and actors @MONTH1 use	9
9433	3480	Except in a book its not what other people are doing and saying its what you yourself is reading and how you yourself is interperating it	10
9434	3480	It takes more than what some people are doing and saying to reflect on what your reading and how your reading it	11
9435	3480	Thats why the whole situation of wether or not libraries certain things such as movies, books, and cds restricted to a certain age group, but instead having the ares labeled on what the category is to know before looking	12
9436	3480	So therefor that is my views and beleifs on why or why not libraries should be restricted to certain people.	13
9437	3481	Many books in libraries have profanity, it just depends on how you read and anazlyze the profanity	0
9438	3481	To some people the strong words help the reader get the point across their head	1
9439	3481	To others the words are just offensive	2
9440	3481	I disagree that most books are offensive to readers I believe that they just help the writers get their points across	3
9441	3481	Many children come across books with offensive language, but if they only read books that are within their age level then they shouldn't have these problems	4
9442	3481	In adult books there is more offensive language, but to adults eyes and ears its a different story because they hear, and possibly say a lot of the words that they are seeing in these books anyhow	5
9443	3481	I believe that any offensive reading material should be found and then sent to a certain area of the library where if you are an adult then you can check these books out	6
9444	3481	This is a way to keep the children away from these books, words, and to keep them 'innocent' still	7
9445	3481	Children don't need to be reading books with offensive language anyhow, but of course this is up to their guardian	8
9446	3481	It's not necassarily a bad thing to have strong language in books, as long as the reader that has the book is taking it in the way the writer is intending, which is most likely to help the theme	9
9447	3481	Children should be kept away from these books but they should not be completely removed from the shelves	10
9448	3481	They should just be put in their own area for adults to read only	11
9449	3482	All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age	0
9450	3482	The books on the shelf are arranged or should be arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first	1
9451	3482	I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, mvies, should be removed due to some of the graphics in each reading material	2
9452	3482	Every bookshelf should be arranged by age difference and spread apart from the other books and or bookshelfs	3
9453	3482	If a child would be in the appropriate isle for there age styled books, less children would pick up the wrong book	4
9454	3482	If children would understand to listen and follow dircections on where to find there specific age appropriate books, less accidents of children taking the wrong book from the bookshelf would occur	5
9455	3482	If children would take the wrong age appropriate book off the bookshelf, I would think that their parent(s) would be responsible and take it back and get the right book for their child(s)	6
9456	3482	If parents would be responsible for taking action, their child should understand that they are taking the wrong book from the bookshelf	7
9457	3482	Wouldn't children understand that if their parent has to take the wrong book back, that they would learn not to do it again	8
9458	3482	I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed due to some of the graphical features in each reading material	9
9459	3482	The books on each bookshelf are or should be arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first	10
9460	3482	All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age.	11
9461	3483	In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines, and music that people find offensive	0
9462	3483	Some find them more offensive than others	1
9463	3483	I believe that just because someone finds these things offensive that they shouldn't be removed from the shelf	2
9464	3483	I believe this because other people @MONTH1 be interested in it, we need information from the resources in the libraries, and all books make people more intelligent	3
9465	3483	These resources are in the library for a reason.If what is on the shelves is a distraction to people, they don't have to pay any attention to it	4
9466	3483	People can find what they like and stay away from what they do not like	5
9467	3483	For example, there are books that talk about real things that happen to real people in real life and some @MONTH1 not be able to handle the descriptive details that are given	6
9468	3483	if it's not easy to handle then just put it back and go read something else	7
9469	3483	Everyone in this world is different and we all like different things	8
9470	3483	In addition, some books in the library are used for informational text	9
9471	3483	College students, teachers, and students from all over the world need a library with these kinds of books, movies, music, and magazines	10
9472	3483	For example, they @MONTH1 need these rescources to help out with a class or presentation	11
9473	3483	If they were removed, they wouldn't have any way to find their information because it was found offensive	12
9474	3483	Lastly, all books make people more intelligent	13
9475	3483	Sometimes things are abstruse and these books help explain them better.We learn something new everyday and we learn it from reading out of books	14
9476	3483	Not only books but magazines and movies help as well	15
9477	3483	Reading books help people to get stronger with their vocabulary and communication.For example, the people who read more than others are usually the ones who like to be involved in plays and don't have a problem with speaking in front of people	16
9478	3483	This is due to their intelligent reading levels	17
9479	3483	They are more likely to remember better than those who do not read and also have a bigger vocabulary	18
9480	3483	So as you can see, people like different things and some are going to find these rescources offensive	19
9481	3483	Also, books are used to help people out and they make people more intelligent	20
9482	3483	If books, movies, and music were removed then we would not have a better intelligence than we do now	21
9483	3483	Every human being will have a problem some how and that is just what life is	22
9484	3483	Life comes with problems and we have to learn to deal with them	23
9485	3483	In fact, that is what we have to do when these problems come up because we all have a different outlook on everything but books being tooken off the shelves would not help anything	24
9486	3483	they can only help us out	25
9487	3484	I think that people who find them offensive just need to stay away from them type of books, music, movies and magazines	0
9488	3484	Some of the books people need to know about	1
9489	3484	Take the consentration camps for instince, people need to learn about them so we can prevent that horrible event from happining again	2
9490	3484	I think that by letting people read those types of books it help us understand and learn what happened in the passed	3
9491	3484	So we need to keep the books on the shelf and let people learn if not we could be in danger	4
9492	3484	They can be in danger by someone being like @PERSON1 and killing millions of jews just because they look diferent	5
9493	3484	Also like slavery just because they are a different color doesnt mean they are not human	6
9494	3484	So keeping them in shelves could help our future	7
9495	3484	Also if you are disturbed by music or movies then simply dont listen/watch them but let other people who is interested in them learn	8
9496	3484	My mom thinks that bloody-scarry movies shouldn't be allowed to sell in stores but i told her that thats what some people like watching and that people need to watch some of them to try to not let anything like them happen ever	9
9497	3484	In conclution, we should keep some of these bad books, music, movies and magazines on the shelves so we will fight to keep horible historical events form happining again	10
9498	3485	I do not believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from shelves	0
9499	3485	Wherever you go in the world, whether you like it or not, your going to come in contact with things you don't find appropriate or you think are offensive	1
9500	3485	@TIME1 world is far from perfect	2
9501	3485	One reason i don't belive they should be removed is because it would be unconstitutional	3
9502	3485	The freedon of speech and the press was not ment to be tampered with	4
9503	3485	If a specific library thinks their articles are innapropriate, an easy solution would be to put these articles in a certain section of the library and warn people what they are	5
9504	3485	The main reason I don't believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves is becuase the world is a nasty place and books are the least of your concerns	6
9505	3485	Kids can't be sheltered their whole lifes, they need to face reality and books are a good source of that	7
9506	3485	Kids these days are resiliant and can handle 'innapropriate' content	8
9507	3485	Parents need to face the fact that their kids are going to be exposed to offensive things in @TIME1 imperfect world of ours	9
9508	3485	It's just a natural part of growing up	10
9509	3485	Another contributing factor is that it would be unconstitutional to remove books and other articles from the shelves of @LOCATION1's libraries	11
9510	3485	When the amendments freedom of speech and press were written down they were intended to stay there	12
9511	3485	They are not guidlines that can be looked over, they are rules set in stone for @TIME1 great country	13
9512	3485	People to @TIME1 for freedom over much bigger issues than books	14
9513	3485	Who are we to tell people what they can and can't write down	15
9514	3485	People's natural opinions can't and shouldn't be governed	16
9515	3485	I think it would be a crime against @LOCATION1 to censor things in libraries	17
9516	3485	My final reason for not censoring libraries is that it all boils down to the people running the library	18
9517	3485	If they think some of their articles are profound and innapropriate, meerly isolate them to a certain section of the library and put a warning for people to see	19
9518	3485	If people don't want to be offended they simply have to just stay away from these sections	20
9519	3485	Take responsibilty for what is in these libraries that is apparently so offending and put them in their own area and stay away from them, do not take them out completely, because who knows someone @MONTH1 want that offending book	21
9520	3485	These are all supporting opinions why I personally do not belive libraries should be censored	22
9521	3485	@TIME1 world is far from perfect and it's not going to become perfect by censoring libraries	23
9522	3485	Plus @TIME1 act would be completely unconstitutional	24
9523	3485	Finally all the libraries have to do is exile these articles to certain areas of the libraries and slap a warning on them	25
9524	3485	If libraries were censored there would be a lot of missing information in @TIME1 world because there are many things in @TIME1 world that are 'offensive' to atleast someone	26
9525	3487	Everything is offensive to someone	0
9526	3487	There is no way to make sure nobody is offended unless you have nothing to offend anybody at all	1
9527	3487	If there is something on the shelf, someone can find something offensive in it	2
9528	3487	here is a good senario	3
9529	3487	there is a childrens book	4
9530	3487	It is one of the gratest books ever written, but it was written before the civil war and there is a racist comment in it	5
9531	3487	@CAPS1 good bye to that book	6
9532	3487	Some people would probably think '@CAPS1 its only a childrens book	7
9533	3487	I'm sure we will survive.' @CAPS1 lets move on to a bigger idea	8
9534	3487	What happens when someone says the bible is offensive	9
9535	3487	@CAPS1 thats gone, but now its supports are saying the other people's entire religion is offensive	10
9536	3487	Thats a couple more books	11
9537	3487	Now we have violence	12
9538	3487	Moderate censorship is acceptable for the young, but there is a line, even though it is hard to find sometimes	13
9539	3487	Obsence images that are illegal to view by a minor are acceptable but those that are legal should be seen without censorship	14
9540	3487	Censorship for those who understand is unacceptable, although select items should be viewed under supervision	15
9541	3487	To strip the rights of a person is not acceptable	16
9542	3487	The @LOCATION1 government has given people freedoms	17
9543	3487	One of those freedoms is the freedom of speech	18
9544	3487	This basically means i can say what ever i want and support whatever i want	19
9545	3487	A book is a form of speech	20
9546	3487	Although some speech is looked down upon, it should not be censored	21
9547	3487	Censorship is just basically saying	22
9548	3487	'you can not say this.' That moves on to	23
9549	3487	'you can not say.' then	24
9550	3487	'you have no say.'     In developing countries, such as congo, if you go to the goverment and say what they are doing wrong and that you are agianst them, take a guess at what happens	25
9551	3487	They shoot you	26
9552	3487	A better word for that would be they censor you	27
9553	3487	If you write a book saying how obama could be a better president, but someone finds it offensive, what happens	28
9554	3487	They censor you	29
9555	3487	Now you get no say in the matter because the supporters of obama dont want you to	30
9556	3487	Do you see much difference	31
9557	3487	Supervisation is a powerful thing	32
9558	3487	Guess what it can do better then censorship	33
9559	3487	With a supervison, children can still learn about topics but are not simply thrown into the obscene areas of it	34
9560	3487	A person is a human being	35
9561	3487	That includes children	36
9562	3487	The have a right to learn without the influence of others, but censorship denies them of that right	37
9563	3487	Censorship should not be used in libraries	38
9564	3487	It takes away freedoms and oppertunities for children	39
9565	3487	It causes violence among people	40
9566	3487	It scars culture, and ignores religion	41
9567	3487	Although censorship has the ability to do more damage then any single person, it is not 'bad'	42
9568	3487	Censorship was created to protect people from things that they feel to be wrong	43
9569	3487	But good intentions do not keep wrong consequenses at bay.	44
9570	3489	Do you believe everyone should have their on beliefs	0
9571	3489	Do you believe everyone should express themselves through their own culture, or have their own opinions	1
9572	3489	Where's that one place where you can experience all of those	2
9573	3489	In a library no one can judge you for your beliefs, culture, or opinions	3
9574	3489	In a library you have the right to have an open mind	4
9575	3489	I believe that any kinds of books, music, movies, magazines, or any other material should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	5
9576	3489	Everyone is different and has their own beliefs and understandings	6
9577	3489	For example, if someone were to go to the library and purchase a book about the famous and deceased @PERSON1, and the other person did not like @PERSON1 and did not understand his cultural background they would take it offensive to come across that book on the shelf	7
9578	3489	If everyone had a say on what books or other materials were put on the shelves of libraries, we wouldn't have any libraries	8
9579	3489	If everyone kept their opinions to themselves in libraries everyone could possibly remain happy and have no arguements	9
9580	3489	Everyone could express themselves everyday, in their own way	10
9581	3490	The material that someone people believe shouln't be viewed by childern, I don't believe should be removed from the library shelves just for that reason	0
9582	3490	The library is not just for the children but also for the adults	1
9583	3490	Children are exposed to many things everyday that are not suited for them, whether it be in their home, at school, or even while their out in public	2
9584	3490	So why alter the library just for the children, when we don't even alter the public for them	3
9585	3490	I think if having certain material that isn't suitable for certain ages, then the children should be monitored closely on what they are pulling from shelves	4
9586	3490	By pulling something from a shelf just because a parent doesn't want their child to see, hear, or watch it, isn't right to the older people that come to the library	5
9587	3490	Another reason i don't agree with removing things is because, by removing items that are not suited for a child is like saying we should move the childrens things off of shelves, because the adults have no use for them	6
9588	3490	Their are always many ways to suit both the needs of a child and the needs of an adult in a library, and still keep the children from what they shouldn't read	7
9589	3490	Most children are so amused by their own materials in the library they are not worried about the adult things	8
9590	3490	If everything a parent didn't want their child to see ws pulled from the selves, then there would be no use for the older people to come to the library	9
9591	3490	Their only custmors left would be the children, and that wouldn't be much business, because the parent's wouldn't want to stay because they wouldn't have anything to entertain them for the toe being	10
9592	3490	There are always ways to make both side of the situatation fair	11
9593	3490	I just don't believe removing material not suited for children is the right thing to do.	12
9594	3492	In this life time we will all have our own oppinions about topics and problems in the world	0
9595	3492	There is a question that ponders in my mind	1
9596	3492	Is censorship in libraries a problem or a right	2
9597	3492	If i was a parent, I think I would be able to understand why I mite want to have a book removed from a shelf, but the thing is though, it is unconstitutional to do that	3
9598	3492	That is why in my oppinion censorship in libraries should not be aloud	4
9599	3492	When I was twelve, one time at the library I was reading the back of a book, and my mom approached me and told me that book was a little too graphic for me to be reading	5
9600	3492	It was about the @CAPS1	6
9601	3492	Now that I am older, I realize why my mom wouldn't want me to be reading a book like that at that age	7
9602	3492	That is one reason I can understand why some one would want to have a book removed from a shelf, but they can not do that because, that book is there to remind us why we should never have another world war again	8
9603	3492	I also think that everyone has there right of an oppinion on why somthing should be, or not should be done	9
9604	3492	One thing that I have obserbed, is that when kids read bad things, and look at bad things, it can really have a big impact on there life as what they do in the future, and there present	10
9605	3492	That reason it's self is a very good explanation on why I think that instead of censoring books, there should be some type of boundaries posted on what types of books should be read beyond a certain age, or if the child wants to read a certain type of book, the child must have a legal gurdian with them at that time	11
9606	3492	With that being said, I have come up with, what I believe to be a very good idea on what should be done in libraries	12
9607	3492	I think that any book that mite have somthing that is a little bit appropriate should be put into a section that is rated just like movies	13
9608	3492	If somthing has a little bit of inappropriate language such as cursing, these books should be put in a section for people over the age of thirteen just like a movie	14
9609	3492	Basically, the books will be put into sections depending on what they are rated just like a movie	15
9610	3492	If the book is rated @CAPS2, you must be over the age of seventeen to read it	16
9611	3492	This idea could be a really good solution, that way no books would be removed, but also these books will be kept out of harms way of children	17
9612	3492	Honestly, if I was a parent I would not want my children to indulge in reading of books that talk about sex, violence, and vulger, but also it is my belief that we all have our own oppinion, and have the right to be able to read and see what we want	18
9613	3492	On thing I think we all need to think about is things that have been done in the past that have had huge benifits on our country	19
9614	3492	Our four fathers, more than one hundred years ago wrote a document called the @CAPS3 of the @ORGANIZATION1	20
9615	3492	This document has amendments	21
9616	3492	These amendments state that we have the right to speak, have oppinions, and read what we want because, we should have the right to live a free life	22
9617	3492	To remove books from the shelves is unconstitutional, and I don't know about you,  but I know that all the people that have gone against the constituotion have not found a great place in this world	23
9618	3492	My basic belief is that, why remove a book from a shelf, when we can impervise so everyone is happy	24
9619	3492	If the world would just get over the harsh things of the books we can all come up with a solution	25
9620	3492	There is an answer for this, books should not be burned they are master pieces	26
9621	3492	Cencorship can not continue in libraries or there won't be any books left.	27
9622	3495	I believe that certain books, movies, music, and magazines should be taken off the shelves, to those who they are offending	0
9623	3495	I myself have not come across any books, movies, or music that have offended me	1
9624	3495	I believe that we should organize our books, movies, and music in a different way perhaps	2
9625	3495	First of all, people who are offended by certain books and movies should speak up, and do something about it	3
9626	3495	Finding a way to reach a happy medium	4
9627	3495	If everyone could take a certain movie or book off of the shelf there wouldn't be any left in my opinion	5
9628	3495	If people find it offending they should stay away from those certain types books or movies	6
9629	3495	Secondly, there are people like me who are not offended at all from these books, music, and movies	7
9630	3495	Its not fair for the ones like me to not be able to read, listen, or watch what we want to	8
9631	3495	If someone doesn't like the movie we loved, and they take it away it's not fair and buisnesses will lose customers	9
9632	3495	Lastly, to find a happy medium between the offended and the people like me	10
9633	3495	I believe we could organize our books, movies, music, and magazines in a different way	11
9634	3495	Instead of organizing by author they should be organized by age restrictions	12
9635	3495	Just like rated @CAPS1 movies, or rated @CAPS2 video games	13
9636	3495	Books and music can be organized in this fassion also	14
9637	3495	It would be easier for people who are offended to stay away from the ones they don't want to be around	15
9638	3495	In conclusion, I believe that allowing any one person to take a certain book, movie, or @CAPS3 off of a shelf is not very smart	16
9639	3495	One, its not fair for people who are not offended	17
9640	3495	Two, buisnesses will lose customers	18
9641	3495	Three, there is a better way to solve this problem	19
9642	3496	Dear, Newspaper editor          I have recently been faced with a situation that has made me feel rather uncomfortable at my local library, I saw a rather graphic magazine being displayed in front of the entire library	0
9643	3496	Now I know that those magazines are, for some, a point of interest, but to others they seem a tad bit crude	1
9644	3496	It also came to my attention that magazines arn't the only form of crude murchandise on the selves of our local libraries	2
9645	3496	They are also littered with movies, books, graphic posters, along with, what i find to be explicit music	3
9646	3496	I know that it would be unreasonable for me to ask for the removal of the murchandise, but I would like to display a comprimise that could come into play	4
9647	3496	What I believe to be crude, @MONTH1 for some be acceptable, but why should I have to be uncomfortable at a public place, while the other is unphased	5
9648	3496	I believe that I have come up with a very simple comprimise, that would benefit me, as well as keep the murchandise avaiable	6
9649	3496	Now most, to all should know that there are children sections in most, if not all libraries	7
9650	3496	So I say this, what if we were to place all the explicit material in its own section, that way customers whom seek the material now know were to go to recieve it	8
9651	3496	This way, I believe would lower the uncomfortable-ness of going to our public library	9
9652	3496	The benefits of this comprimise seem endless, to me	10
9653	3496	This way the children are left with a safe enviroment to pick out their books, and the adults that find it explicit have a comfortable surrounding to enjoy their excursion to the library	11
9654	3496	Though I am not trying to benefit those whom seek the material, I think it would	12
9655	3496	This way all of the material they want can be found in one place, and they won't have to go searching the entire library for it	13
9656	3496	I think I speak for most when I say that our public libraries need to be a safe, family friendly enviroment, not only for children, but for those who wish to enjoy their library expierence	14
9657	3496	Thank you for your time,                         @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @PERSON1	15
9658	3497	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 does that mean well I guess it means if their is a book on the shelf then they probly dont want their children to get a hold of it	0
9659	3497	Maybe there parents should look at the books first or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf	1
9660	3497	I think all books that have offensive stuff in them should be taken off the shelf.If I was going to take books off the shelf it would only be the offensive science fiction books	2
9661	3497	If @CAPS3 based on a true story and @CAPS3 offensive it should be heard anywise because @CAPS3 part of history	3
9662	3497	Everyone needs to hear it because @CAPS3 true	4
9663	3497	If I was going to take music off the shelf it would only be the ones with a lot of bad language	5
9664	3497	For movies children should only whach @CAPS2 rated movies and nothing else	6
9665	3497	For magazines children should not read magazines they should be taken off the shelfs.The experiences I had with all these things when I was a child was my parents never let me whach anything or listen with anything with bad language	7
9666	3497	But I could read any book I wanted to	8
9667	3497	It was in a book @CAPS3 not like I could onder stand @CAPS1 that bad ward ment.I think @PERSON1 saying is that she wants to keep all books on the shelf because she said 'you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	9
9668	3497	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  I think the point can go ether way because she says everyone has the same rights	10
9669	3497	And then she states that their wont be any books left for us	11
9670	3497	I think that means every book is bad if shes saying @CAPS1 i think shes saying.Their is a way to leave the books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,  on the shelfs	12
9671	3497	Like I sayed in the first pargraph there parents need to pay more attention to their children	13
9672	3497	And no @CAPS1 their reading	14
9673	3497	To sum it all up I say take them off the shelfs.	15
9674	3498	In a library it's censorship should be conrtolled by the people that go to that library	0
9675	3498	If it is a public library then the visitors should have the right to choose what books go on the shelf	1
9676	3498	The libraries should not take books off the shelf due to the beliefs of one person, no the libraries should take all the books and give them a rateing once they have that only the reader should decide if the book, music, movies, magazines, etc, are offensive to them	2
9677	3498	Of course there are some books that adults @MONTH1 not wish their child to read and then they should talk to the librarian and set a boundry of what rateing of book their child can check out	3
9678	3498	Organizing the books this way anbody can read anything they want to though there are the books they don't want to read or even see on the shelf, they need to stop a minute and realize that one of the books they like someone else might not want on the shelf	4
9679	3498	In the end the books that are on the shelf are the choice of the library because they are the people that purchase the books	5
9680	3498	so to prevent a power struggle this way a comittee should be set up to decide what books to purchase	6
9681	3498	you will still have to deal with people not wanting a certain kind of book, but those people will just have to deal with it	7
9682	3498	The books on the libraries banned book list should be in the libray also, the books are just books weather you read them or not is your choice	8
9683	3498	The one exception to this should be at school libraries because it is the schools money purchasing the books the administration or the school board should choose which books go in the library	9
9684	3498	In short my veiw of book censorship is that, the library will choose the books that go into the library	10
9685	3498	To make things easier the books should have a rateing system that would be the national standard for all public libraries	11
9686	3498	Like I stated previously the books are just books its your choice to read them	12
9687	3501	There should not be any style of censorship in the @LOCATION1	0
9688	3501	I am a strong believer that our country is the best because we are allowed by law and the constitution to have our own ideals, likes, and even dislikes	1
9689	3501	I understand that libraries are a place for all people of all ages, but I do not believe that they should censor what they put on their shelves	2
9690	3501	In the US we are known for accepting all different types of lifestyles, and religions	3
9691	3501	this is one reason I think censorship is against @CAPS1 policy	4
9692	3501	One of the things that sparked our countries secession from @LOCATION2, was censorship	5
9693	3501	The @CAPS2 would not allow the colonies news papers to speak poorly of him or his ideas and policies	6
9694	3501	this is why when the US was formed the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 built freedom of ideals and speech into the constitution	7
9695	3501	I do, however, agree with some censorship	8
9696	3501	The movie and song rating system is a form of censorship I believe to be needed	9
9697	3501	with out this form of censorship, small children would be aloud to see and hear things they are not ready for	10
9698	3501	This is also a good way for people to decide if they would like to experience the ideas and language presented by the matieral rated	11
9699	3501	I think that there should be a rating system (or explanitory system) present in libraries	12
9700	3501	Instead of pulling conservercial books off the shelves completly, we should rather put a warning on them	13
9701	3501	I feel strongly that I have a right as an @CAPS1 to read and experience any type of book, music, news, or picture I would like to see	14
9702	3501	If we start restricting what we as @CAPS5 are alowed to see, we start loosing our freedom	15
9703	3501	we become like those who live in comunist countries where only what the government wants you to see is seen	16
9704	3501	The statement made by Katherine Paterson supports my ideals greatly	17
9705	3501	especialy 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us'	18
9706	3501	This sentence shows that if we start pulling or restricting the things people deem offiencive, there would be nothing left to read or enjoy	19
9707	3501	Censorship in the @LOCATION1 is a direct violation of our consitiution	20
9708	3501	I am a believer in, if it bothers you or upsets you, dont read it	21
9709	3501	By doing this we can get rid of censorship, and be able to fully enjoy all our rights as @CAPS5	22
9710	3501	We also allow our right to be informed to be excercised.	23
9711	3502	Movies, books, music, magazines, and more all have there own way of expressing the content in them depending on what the author is talking about	0
9712	3502	If the author choses to write something that you do not nessisarly agree with or is offensive to you then do not read or watch that piece of material	1
9713	3502	Everyone is intitled to there own opions	2
9714	3502	Theycan do and say what they want	3
9715	3502	Somethings those opions @MONTH1 have consequences involved but you still can write the material you want	4
9716	3502	As an author you provide a book to the public, If it gets that far	5
9717	3502	When a book is published then it is sent to a library that way you can choose to read if you would like	6
9718	3502	I book should not be taking off the shelf is someone finds that offensive	7
9719	3502	Someone else @MONTH1 not find it offensive and might actually enjoy that reading material	8
9720	3502	When a movie is made and it is '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or is offensive to someone then people just do not go and see that movie	9
9721	3502	They do not stop playing it because someone @MONTH1 having different feelings about the movie	10
9722	3502	If you find a movie, magazine, or even a book offensive then do not read it or do not watch it	11
9723	3502	Someome else @MONTH1 enjoy something that you do not	12
9724	3502	Not everyone in the world today is going to agree on whats offensive and whats not	13
9725	3502	You can not always make everyone happy	14
9726	3502	If the book becomes a problem and it a majority amount of people that think it is offensive then yes maybe it should be talked about taking off of the shelf	15
9727	3502	If you think a book or movie is offensive then you have that right to not watch or read it	16
9728	3502	If someone else wants to read or watch the piece of material then they also have the right to do that	17
9729	3502	If something is offensive it is a personal choice to think so, so why take if off the shelf when they just do not have read it?	18
9730	3503	Censorship is a contraversal topic	0
9731	3503	Some believe that it is necessary others would disagree	1
9732	3503	My personal opinion would be that censorship is not necessary	2
9733	3503	Everyone is entitles to what they believe, and others have to have the maturity to accept that	3
9734	3503	Censorship is not necessary because if you are offended by some material then don't read or listen to it	4
9735	3503	It is as simple as that	5
9736	3503	Everyone can be offended by something, so if everything was removed that was found to be offensive to someone there would be nothing left	6
9737	3503	If things were organized into sections that stated how offensive the material was then it is likely that almost everything would be in the offensive section	7
9738	3503	Because censorship is contraversal there are many different thoughts on the subject	8
9739	3503	It ranges from no censorship to complete censorship, my view be just one of many	9
9740	3503	Censorship is truely just a matter of maturity and how a person goes about dealing with the material	10
9741	3503	The only person who can let you be offened is yourself, therefore censorship is not necessary in the library people just need to be mature about it.	11
9742	3504	I think they should remeove it if the publick thinks its offensive	0
9743	3504	I think it should be that way about every thing	1
9744	3504	If something is offending you then you should say something about it	2
9745	3504	Im not saying that it will be takin care of all the time but you might get lucky and someone might fix it so your not offened all the time	3
9746	3504	Growing up at home dad would always tell me if I didn't like something then don't do it, unless it was somethin that had to be done then I would have to do it	4
9747	3504	So when something happens that I don't like, I either change my ways or I aviode whatever it is	5
9748	3504	I rairly change my ways though	6
9749	3504	Some times that is a bad thing though, but who hasn't mad a mistake or two	7
9750	3504	This is really hard for me to right about beacuse I don't care what other people think	8
9751	3504	So I really don't get offened	9
9752	3504	I do know some people the get offened easy though	10
9753	3504	I try to stay away from them beacuse you have to watch what you say all the time	11
9754	3504	To me thats no fun, I mean come on dude you have to be able to take a joke	12
9755	3504	If more people were easy going then I wouldn't be writing this essa	13
9756	3504	I bet there would be a lot less droma to but I dont know	14
9757	3504	If you know of a book, movie, anything that will or might offened you, just dont read it again	15
9758	3504	It might not offened the next reader	16
9759	3504	They might really like the book or whatever it is	17
9760	3504	All you have to do is stay away from what ever it is that is bothering you	18
9761	3504	After a wile you will forget about it	19
9762	3504	I guess if it really really bothered you, and there was a lot more people that felt the same way about the same thing then yes remove it	20
9763	3504	If there is only a hand full of people saying they are offened then I would just tell them sorry but more people like it better so it will stay.	21
9764	3506	I personally think that certain materials that are found offensive should not be removed from shelves	0
9765	3506	I think this because it's parent's responsibilities to keep track of what their children read, watch, or listen to	1
9766	3506	You can't get away from things that are offensive to some and everybody has a right to do what they want	2
9767	3506	The first reason why I don't think offensive material should be removed from shelves is because it is the parents duty to watch what their kids are doing	3
9768	3506	If parents don't want their children to observe this stuff, then they should keep it off limits	4
9769	3506	I have heard some parents claim that they didn't know what the material was like, but that is why they made warnings	5
9770	3506	That is no excuse	6
9771	3506	The second reason for not removing offensive material is that there is no way to get away from it	7
9772	3506	Now a days, material that is offensive to some is all around	8
9773	3506	Shows, movies,and music, they all have something not suitable for all audiences	9
9774	3506	Plus children will learn about this offensive material sometime in their life anyway	10
9775	3506	If they do not hear about it in movies or magazines, they are probably hearing about it at school	11
9776	3506	These days children learn about things sooner and sooner	12
9777	3506	The third reason offensive material should not be removed from shelves is that everyone has a right to read or listen to whatever they want	13
9778	3506	It is up to them as to what they want to watch, not everybody else	14
9779	3506	They should be able to go in a place and buy something that they want to watch and not get questioned about it	15
9780	3506	That is why I don't think offensive material should be removed	16
9781	3506	It is the parent's responsibilities, you can't get away from it, and everybody has a right to do what they want	17
9782	3506	A way to help with this problem is to move offensive material to a higher shelf	18
9783	3506	This would make parents of younger children happy, but also the people wanting to view this material happy	19
9784	3506	This way you are not completely removing it, but making it harder for younger audiences to get to it	20
9785	3507	How can writing be offensive	0
9786	3507	Many @CAPS1 find swear words in writing or violence to be very offensive	1
9787	3507	Yet others find that those things make their writing more interesting	2
9788	3507	Writing can cover all aspects of life and give us ideas like racism and other inappropriate thoughts	3
9789	3507	It seems like in today's writing you can pick up just about anything and somone will find it offensive	4
9790	3507	That means if we censored our libraries to the extreme there would be no books left	5
9791	3507	It is just like Katherine Paterson says in the quote, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     @CAPS1 can't deny that books and any other writing place ideas in our head	6
9792	3507	That idea is a seed and we can either choose to water that seed and let it grow or cause it to die out	7
9793	3507	I believe we have a choice to either except or deny those offensive ideas in our head	8
9794	3507	If we find something offensive, simply set the book down and use that better judgemnt	9
9795	3507	We know what is right therefore we decide what is ok to read	10
9796	3507	Everyone sees things differently	11
9797	3507	What about children, can we trust their better judgement	12
9798	3507	I fear that children don't have as great of judgement as more mature adults	13
9799	3507	The resposibility of judgement lies more on the parents of that child than the libraries	14
9800	3507	The libraries place books for kids in a certain section to make sure they find appropriate books for their age	15
9801	3507	Both the adults and children get to find books that fit them and don't offend them	16
9802	3507	If libraries did do censorchip it would deny us our rights and freedom to speek our minds clearly without a haze being placed to confuse it	17
9803	3507	We as a country were built off the radical and offensive things written about the @CAPS2	18
9804	3507	Those words are what fired us up to become an independent country	19
9805	3507	Just think if they would have censored those ideas	20
9806	3507	Would we still be @LOCATION1 today	21
9807	3507	What it all comes down to is not that we should censore our reading but that we should use our better judgement.	22
9808	3508	In today's society it is easy to find small things that offend people wether it is politics or religion	0
9809	3508	The truth is no one is able to keep everyone happy	1
9810	3508	A major debate of today would be that of the media	2
9811	3508	Should people have the right to remove books, music, movies, or magazines from our shelves because they are found offensive to one person	3
9812	3508	The answer is no	4
9813	3508	Three important reasons support this answer: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and knowing everyone can find something that is offensive	5
9814	3508	When @LOCATION1 was finally free from @CAPS1 a main goal was to have our freedom of speech	6
9815	3508	This was a huge achievement for the @ORGANIZATION1	7
9816	3508	Allowing people to remove matieral from our shelves would be breaking the one rule we worked so hard to gain	8
9817	3508	People today rely on being able to speak their minds to be apart of their government	9
9818	3508	Another law that @CAPS2's appriecate is, freedom of the press	10
9819	3508	Being allowed to write how they feel is what @LOCATION1 is practically based on	11
9820	3508	With out this wouldn't we be back into the old ways that @CAPS3 fought to change	12
9821	3508	This is a question you must think about when making this important decision	13
9822	3508	Finally a huge impact on this decision is knowing that everyone has an opinion on something	14
9823	3508	It is easy to find someone that is offened by the smallest of things	15
9824	3508	What happens when someone decideds to find the @CAPS4 offensive to their religion	16
9825	3508	Do we take it off the shelve and tell the @CAPS5 sorry	17
9826	3508	If we decided to allow this would there even be books, movies, music, or even magazines for us	18
9827	3508	It is easy to assume just to take a book off the shelve because it's offensive to you, but what happens when we allow this to everyone	19
9828	3508	That is why when coming to a decision on how we should handle this, it is going to take much more thinking than a couple of days	20
9829	3508	We must remember though the rights we are given as @CAPS3	21
9830	3508	the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, and we must always think about how this is going to effect our later generations.	22
9831	3509	From the point of view of a student, books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves just because of the material it contains	0
9832	3509	I read, watch, and listen to things everyday that my parents my not be too thrilled about, but it hasn't changed the person I am today	1
9833	3509	You can't escape things like drugs, sex, and other explicit things that we might not want our children reading about	2
9834	3509	It's in society	3
9835	3509	These things are everywhere, and just taking these materials off the shelves are not going to solve the problem	4
9836	3509	I think that we have a freedom to read about, listen, or watch whatever we would like, and removing these things takes away our freedom	5
9837	3509	I think that inappropriate books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should not be taken off the shelves	6
9838	3509	'@CAPS1' items are all over society	7
9839	3509	It's everywhere you look	8
9840	3509	Billboards, signs, books, magazine, music, television, movies, etc., but taking things like books, movies, music, and magazines off the shelves are not going to stop the inappropriate behavoir	9
9841	3509	Everyone in society is still going to act this way, whether you can stop your children from hearing about it or not	10
9842	3509	You still have commercials, billboards, etc	11
9843	3509	What are you going to do	12
9844	3509	Ban your children from life in general	13
9845	3509	No, I don't think so	14
9846	3509	Reading, listening, learning, about this stuff isn't going to make your child a horrible person	15
9847	3509	I personally think, at a certain age, they need to know about this stuff	16
9848	3509	For example, I'm a good student, I behave well outside of school, I have good friends, and I get along with my family	17
9849	3509	I also read every single one of @PERSON1 books	18
9850	3509	All of them are about people who do drugs, are suicidal, and do sexual related things	19
9851	3509	These books are extremely good	20
9852	3509	Definitely the best books I've ever read, but reading these books hasn't changed who I am	21
9853	3509	I don't do drugs, I'm not into sexual things, so why would it hurt if I read books about it	22
9854	3509	From my experience, reading these things are honestly kind of helpful	23
9855	3509	It takes you deeper into things	24
9856	3509	Everyone knows the basic learning you get in school, which is extremely @CAPS2	25
9857	3509	Reading these books, and listening to this kind of music, and watching these kinds of movies, takes a whole different point of view	26
9858	3509	Back to my experience with the @PERSON1 books, you read stories that are based off of her life and relationship with her daughter	27
9859	3509	Crank, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 is a trilogy of books that show the life of @LOCATION1	28
9860	3509	You see the struggle, the hurt, and the pain the family goes through as @PERSON2 starts to walk with the monster, also known as @CAPS5	29
9861	3509	Reading these books makes me realize that I don't want to ever put myself through the things @PERSON2 does to herself, and her family	30
9862	3509	It gives a whole new look on things	31
9863	3509	After reading these, I believe I won't ever do 'offensive' things	32
9864	3509	From my experiences as a student, I don't believe taking offensive material off the shelves is necessary	33
9865	3509	It gives a deeper look into information about these things	34
9866	3509	Also, you can't escape explicit material	35
9867	3509	These things are a part of life, something you can't run and hide from	36
9868	3509	You just have to accept the fact that it's there, and it's not going away	37
9869	3509	If you think your children are going to start doing those kinds of things after reading them, talk to them about it	38
9870	3509	You can't protect your children from offensive material	39
9871	3509	At least not forever	40
9872	3511	Many of us have been at the library once in our life time, but have you ever had a day when you took your little kids to the library and they grab a book or a magazine and saw something that you were not very happy with	0
9873	3511	Well many of us have	1
9874	3511	Should the library have books, magazines, or even movies that are offensive to your kids, little borther/sisters, or friends	2
9875	3511	The public library should be for anyone and everyone to come and do what they have to do, not to see a nacket picture or something that can be offensive to you or your the little kids	3
9876	3511	Well we can do something about that	4
9877	3511	Having bad pictures in a book or magazine can be bad for the kids and even the young ones like us because many young teens can get bad censorship	5
9878	3511	The books, magazines and even movies that have offensive pictures or people with no clothes on should be removed from any public library shelves	6
9879	3511	A lot of the parents do not want there kids to go to the library and look at pictures that are really offensive	7
9880	3511	They also do not want them to be checking out movies that can give them bad influins	8
9881	3511	In the library there should be good and fun books, magazines, and movies	9
9882	3511	The people that work at the library should remove all the bad itams	10
9883	3511	Allowing to have all the nacket pictures and movies at the library will allow some teens to get bad ideas from it	11
9884	3511	This is why the libraries should remove all this books, movies, magazines, and even music	12
9885	3511	Many of the older people @MONTH1 think that it is not fair for them	13
9886	3511	Well they should know that it can harm there kids and it can also teach there young kids bad stuff	14
9887	3511	Some of the older people @MONTH1 think different and others they @MONTH1 think the same	15
9888	3511	Many of the parents do not want there kids to be seeing bad pictures or to check out bad movies or books	16
9889	3511	That's why removing these itams are good for many of the kids and young teens that are just learing how to have a boy/girlfriend	17
9890	3512	Libraries are public for a reason, and that is to interest people with different types of entertainment	0
9891	3512	I know some people have their opinions about things but that is why there are variaties because every single person is different	1
9892	3512	In my opinion no I do not think certian materials should be banned becuase they @MONTH1 have a more mature content than others think is appropiate	2
9893	3512	Disagree with me that is alright but, have you ever stopped to think about issues like this	3
9894	3512	Im going to list a few reasons with explainations on my opinion becuase I think they @MONTH1 point out a few good concepts on why I do not believe they should be banned	4
9895	3512	First, in the present society everybody has different views and opinions on things that should be discussed	5
9896	3512	The public has a right to entertain themself any way they would like to choose and with any material or subject matter they would like	6
9897	3512	Taking away their entertainment would be the same as telling them that they cannot wear the clothes they would like, or drive the car they want	7
9898	3512	If you were to walk into a library and see a subject that does not fit your standards or interest than you should simply walk away and find a more suitable subject matter for yourself	8
9899	3512	Some people look at things in a totally different way than you, @CAPS1 because you do not like different styles of entertainment does not mean somebody else dosen't	9
9900	3512	Second, You would be takng jobs away from many people who love what they do	10
9901	3512	People have an issue with some content of books, or movies, but that is sometimes based on what an author is feeling, or even what their life maybe like	11
9902	3512	Others they write about real life events things that happen to normal people everyday, that should be looked up upon to have people write their stories down for the whole world to see	12
9903	3512	Criticizing subjects of entertainment is downgrading different forms of art	13
9904	3512	Pretty much what people feel like is, its not ok to have a mature subject discussed about in a book but in a painting it is, very hipocritical	14
9905	3512	Lastly, If the material being pulished today was wanted off the shelfs of a library, than why would it even be printed and sold to people all over the world	15
9906	3512	It is because there are people who do like it and do not have a problem at all and like me is not bothered by it what so ever	16
9907	3512	In my opinion i do not think any form of entertianment should be banned or taken away from society in anyway, because than you would be taking peoples joy	17
9908	3513	In libraries, is censorship truly needed	0
9909	3513	I believe there should be some censorship to some extent	1
9910	3513	Libraries are usually pretty good at sorting things	2
9911	3513	I mean, they do use the @ORGANIZATION1 in every library I've been in	3
9912	3513	But even when they do sort the books, music, and magazines by topic, there's always something offensive that can fit in that topic as well	4
9913	3513	I remember as a child of seven or eight going to the library all the time with my mother	5
9914	3513	I realized I was getting too old for the 'kiddy book section,' so I ventured forth to places I've never been before	6
9915	3513	Any isle of books was open to anyone, I felt that I had the world in the palm of my hand	7
9916	3513	Most of the books were too mature of a read for me anyways, butt I still looked through them all	8
9917	3513	I mean, it was something very new to me	9
9918	3513	almost like an adventure	10
9919	3513	Then, I came across the music	11
9920	3513	There were so many inappropriate titles, cover-arts, and even names of bands	12
9921	3513	But this perked my curiosity	13
9922	3513	I remember thinking to myself, 'were books this way too?' I soon found out yes, they were	14
9923	3513	There were even doctor books with graphic images	15
9924	3513	The worst were books with cuss words that I found	16
9925	3513	Innocence in the library was gone	17
9926	3513	I think libraries should have a different section for older, more mature people	18
9927	3513	not including children	19
9928	3513	Some people loves books, and will open any book just to read or look at the pictures	20
9929	3513	Libraries need to realize that	21
9930	3513	I was once that little kid who opened the wrong book, at the wrong time	22
9931	3513	In conclusion, I think libraries should have at least some censorship	23
9932	3513	I understand that people enjoy the books and music that once terrored me, but I think there should be something done about it	24
9933	3514	The quote from the author Katherine Paterson is very true , I believe that if we were to remove everything in the world that we took offense to then there really wouldn't be anything left in the world to gaze upon	0
9934	3514	I remember when I was younger and  I had just gotten off of school one evening and had decided to go downtown to our town's library , I needed a book for my school project on the holocaust and I remember one of the ladies working there telling me that the book should be removed from the shelves because it was offensive to jewish people	1
9935	3514	I had at first been a little bit outraged that she would tell the person checking out the book that it should be taken from the shelves mostly because since I'm the one going to read it why would you whine about it to me in the first place plus it's more offensive to tell the person that they shouldn't check out the book that they want to read then it is to the jewish	2
9936	3514	Another time something like this occured was when I was in @ORGANIZATION1 and one of the customers was complaining about some religious magizine that they shouldn't be aloud to sell because some of the articles were very offensive to people of certain religions	3
9937	3514	The customer who complained was taken straight up to the managers office because he actually ripped a couple of the magazines in half , talk about having issues , anyway the customer was kicked out to say the least and had to pay for the magazines they'd destroyed as well	4
9938	3514	There has been a lot of times in my life where someone has decided to speak out about their dislikes of something and although they put up a good argument they're lacking in a couple of important things , one of which is the fact that most of the things people complain that need to be taken from the shelves have something to do with history and another thing is there are not enough people complaining about it	5
9939	3514	But the quote by Katherine Paterson is like a knock at the door , it speaks of what could happen if we removed everything from our shelves that are offensive to others and when I read that quote the first thing that pops into my head is another quote , ' @CAPS1 speak louder than words '	6
9940	3515	My views on cencorship @MONTH1 not  be what others believe	0
9941	3515	With a good understanding of what the majority of people would call innapropriate, evaluating what books should be placed on the shelfs is easier	1
9942	3515	Although many people @MONTH1 think that a certain book is appropriate, others @MONTH1 disagree	2
9943	3515	That's why creating a rating system would be best	3
9944	3515	With a rating system of books, movies, magazines, and other materials in a library, parents would have a better understanding of what they want their child to read or watch	4
9945	3515	If there is vulgar language inside of the book, it could be labeled with a rating and an explanation of why the book is rated the way it is	5
9946	3515	That way, if there are complaints of the item, the library would not be blamed	6
9947	3515	I personally don't think that getting rid of materials because of others' complaints should occur	7
9948	3515	I believe that the books could be kept, but labeled or even placed on a different section of shelves to reference that they @MONTH1 be more innapropriate than the normal	8
9949	3515	What happens when a college student needs a book that is mandatory for his class and the book is banned because of 'innapropriate usage'	9
9950	3515	There is no way of making everyone completely satisfied, but with this system a lot of issues would be resolved	10
9951	3515	My views on cencorship @MONTH1 not be what others believe, but taking away perfectly written books is not right	11
9952	3515	Disagreement isn't the easiest thing, but just because it's hard doesn't mean you have to give up	12
9953	3515	The rating system would decrease the complications and help others to be more free with their decisions	13
9954	3516	Books are gateways to other worlds	0
9955	3516	Today there are books on almost any topic anybody could dream of	1
9956	3516	People use books to forget their troubles and take a trip to somewhere outside of themselves	2
9957	3516	Now the content of some books are not always appropriate	3
9958	3516	Schools try to provide books that appeal to all audiences, but that ability is being impaired by books being banned from shelves	4
9959	3516	Students then can't read a book simply because someone else didn't appprove of the content	5
9960	3516	That is unfair and should be stopped	6
9961	3516	Students should have the right to make choose what they want to read, yet some people want to take that right away from students	7
9962	3516	Students, are also able to make choices on what's appropriate for them to read	8
9963	3516	If lawmakers give in to the complaints of a few people it could hinder a students rights and make students believe that they are not trusted	9
9964	3516	The content of what goes into a book is up to the author	10
9965	3516	The books someone decides to read is up to that particular reader	11
9966	3516	Sometimes authors go into extensive detail to get their point across or have a book with very mature content in them	12
9967	3516	Now some people think that because a book is inappropriate in their views then it shouldn't be avalivable to read at all	13
9968	3516	This is unfair not only to any potiental reader of that book, but also the author who worked hard to write that book	14
9969	3516	Students are smarter than many people give them credit for	15
9970	3516	They know what they should and shouldn't be reading, but if the choice of what they read is left up to other people they feel betrayed and untrusted	16
9971	3516	Students have as many rights as people who don't go to school	17
9972	3516	If books are being taken of shelves based on a few people opinions then their rights are being infringed upon by the people who deemed it inappropriate	18
9973	3516	Now the students freedom to choose what they want to read is gone, and all that remains is books choosen worthy by other people	19
9974	3516	Rights are something guarenteed to students as the enter school, buty now rights are slowly being taken away from students	20
9975	3516	The right to choose what book they read is one that should not be taken	21
9976	3516	As author Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf, that work that i abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	22
9977	3516	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  If one person says they think a book should be taken away, then another person wants another book taken away, until the point where no books are left then how will students ever get to read	23
9978	3516	Books are essential to a students growth into adulthood	24
9979	3516	If people gain the right to take books off shelves then music, movies, magazines will all get taken off shelves too	25
9980	3516	Books are for any reader that decides they want to go to that world	26
9981	3516	Students have the right to choose what books they read, as well as the ability to know what they should read	27
9982	3516	Books should remain where they belong, in schools on the shelves.	28
9983	3517	Do you think there are certain books and magazines that should not be displayed in librarys	0
9984	3517	Well here's my perspective	1
9985	3517	I think that librarys shouldn't have certain books due to racism, violence, and etc	2
9986	3517	One, because there are young children that read books throughout the library, and two because books and magazines due to racism and ect	3
9987	3517	can be offensive to others	4
9988	3517	How would you feel about your children reading about stuff like that	5
9989	3517	That's something a child doesn't need to know at an early age	6
9990	3517	So that's my perspective on it	7
9991	3518	There are many materials in libraries that are offcensive to certain people	0
9992	3518	I don't think they should be taken off the shelves but I do believe they should be put into a different section in the library	1
9993	3518	Almost every thing in life offends someone in one way or another	2
9994	3518	It @MONTH1 be as little as 'blonde jokes' or as major as saying something about someone's sexuallity	3
9995	3518	I know little kids wouldnt understand those types of things but parents can't keep their kids hidden away forever	4
9996	3518	If someone says something about someone else, then I do believe it's wrong	5
9997	3518	I mean think about how many 'blonde jokes' there are	6
9998	3518	A lot of blondes I know, don't take those jokes seriously	7
9999	3518	One of my good friends is a natural blonde and she is probably the smartest blonde I have ever met	8
10000	3518	Whenever she hears a blonde joke she laughs and say something funny to go with it	9
10001	3518	Probably one of the most major things that people get offended by is politics or someones sexuallity	10
10002	3518	Politics create huge problems for people who don't think something should be one way and then if the governer turns around and says something and someone else will take it way to serious	11
10003	3518	Many people who have are different because they dont like who they are 'suppose' to like are always offended by someone in some shape or form	12
10004	3518	It's not like parents can keep us away from it forever	13
10005	3518	Little kids become teenagers, teenagers because young adults who eventually become adults	14
10006	3518	People should learn how to deal with different struggles in life	15
10007	3518	So in conclusion, if a parent doesn't want to expose their child to things they thing is offensive then good for them but other people like to learn about the things that people find offensive and that create problems in the @LOCATION1	16
10008	3518	I believe that by leaving the books, movies and magazines on the shelves in a seperate area of the library isn't a bad idea	17
10009	3518	Think about it, if you take books away from people who want to learn about the different things and want to know why people get offended, wouldn't they feel offended too because you took that away from them	18
10010	3519	Some books are offensive to some people	0
10011	3519	But eveyrone has the right to read any book they want	1
10012	3519	I believe we shouldnt censor books that are found offensive in schools	2
10013	3519	If people find offensive from the beggining, find another book to read or talk to the teacher	3
10014	3519	I have had my experience with books who are offensive to me	4
10015	3519	Everyone has a book they have read that does that to them	5
10016	3519	But that same book i have read might be interesting to other people	6
10017	3519	Whatever doesnt @CAPS1 you makes you stronger, right	7
10018	3519	So don't take a book in a hurtful way	8
10019	3519	Books are meant to be read and some authors direct the book to certain people	9
10020	3519	I had poeple come up to me from our own school saying the books they read were a horrible experience	10
10021	3519	Specially when all they talk about is suicide and one of my best friends has trouble with that because of her dad	11
10022	3519	I told her to talk to her teacher and he changed the book for her	12
10023	3519	Thats all you have to do and not make anything big about it	13
10024	3519	I also read the book, 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2', which is censored in some states because its hurtful to some people	14
10025	3519	The story is about a white family trying to help an @CAPS3-@CAPS4 man who was accused of raped when he never commited such thing	15
10026	3519	That was not acceptable at the time and with all the evidence in the world they still couldn't help him	16
10027	3519	Its a great story about what black poeple went through in earlier years	17
10028	3519	And to think they would censor a story about a white lawyer trying to help someone who isn't his own race is inspiring to me, not offensive	18
10029	3519	He got harrased and his children got harrased but he still fought with all he had to save his deffendant	19
10030	3519	I am a @NUM1 year old boy who when he read this book knowing who had a heart and who didnt made me cry my eyes out	20
10031	3519	It's sad to know this book is censored in some states when this is defenitely one of the best books i have ever read and also the only one that got to me	21
10032	3519	It would be a great experience for anybody to read this book so even if it is censored where you live, go buy it and read it anyway	22
10033	3519	I feel the state assumes they are gonna offend people	23
10034	3519	They might not even test it anyways	24
10035	3519	They might just say its gonna offend this kinda people and thats it	25
10036	3519	How do they cokme up with it	26
10037	3519	Do they let everybody read it once	27
10038	3519	No, and they should just leave it whoever doesn't read it doesnt have to or they can talk with their teacher	28
10039	3519	Its not so hard to decide to censor something when its only your opinion	29
10040	3519	Thats why i would look into the opinion of others	30
10041	3519	All in all censorship shouldn't be allowed	31
10042	3519	It ruins the oppurtonity for people to read books they might find good and interesting to them	32
10043	3519	Let the kids read atleast in highschool when they are all almost adults so they can read whatever they want	33
10044	3520	Censorship being as touchy a subject it is in my belief should be very rarely upheld, yes I believe there should be exceptions such as censoring materials in a childrens library or a childrens section of a bigger library, but to censor is to take ones freedom of speech, and expression away from them and is by my standards nothing more than unamerican	0
10045	3520	Censorship acceptions should definetley be held in certain circumstances such as on a children's television network or a school library	1
10046	3520	Growing up my parents have not set any regulations for me regarding censorship, ever since I can remember I have been able to watch, read, and listen to anything I have ever wanted so my opinion is obviously going to slide toward uncensorship right	2
10047	3520	Wrong, although I do believe that nothing should be censored from the general public except for in special cases, I believe that it is the parents choice and full responsibility regarding their childrens censorship needs	3
10048	3520	I myself when I am a parent are going to censor my children away from what I seem unfit for their age whatever it @MONTH1 be	4
10049	3520	The main reason that I am writing is to explain the moral issue that censorship is offering, yes the reason we consor is because we believe that the material is offensive or has ill moral, but these are the opinions and beliefs of the creators and being in a society that claims to be tolerant of one's beliefs we should respect the creator's beliefs even though it is not the belief of ourselves	5
10050	3520	To censor is to force an artist or in essence a creator to change they're very reflections of themselves, after all that is what a work of art is whether it be a painting, a musical piece, or a television show it shows a distinct look into the creators mind and beliefs to censor is to cut off or warp this communication between the audience and the creator thus violating the freedom of speech, and freedom of expression that our country holds so dear	6
10051	3520	I call this a touchy subject because when there is childrens welfare involved it is always a touchy subject, to prevent children from being exposed to what their parents seem inapropriate I believe that we should retain a censorship in such places as childrens library or childrens television networks, but as a country we are putting too much responsibility and reliability on the hope that the government will censor what we seem unfit when in reality it should be the job and choice of the parents to censor what their children are exposed to	7
10052	3520	to solve this growing debate I believe the solution lies in the question, 'should we censor material' well yes and no I generally think that for every book, song, or creation that some seem unfit for society should be released as censored and uncensored, this would open up oppurtunities for children to read more advanced literature, will not take away from the personel expression of the creators, and will not deny the public what they are looking for because a censored material is a loss for the creator as well as the audience who enjoy it	8
10053	3521	If materials are offensive they should not be displayed	0
10054	3521	Offensive materials can have big effects on children younger than at least ten years of age	1
10055	3521	I believe that if materials at a library are found offensive and proved to be offensive, then they should be removed	2
10056	3521	Materials at libraries are not for everyone	3
10057	3521	A lot of it is especially not for young children	4
10058	3521	For example: @CAPS1 could be a young child wanting to check-out a movie that looks interesting  to him/her	5
10059	3521	The movie could be rated @NUM1 but the parents still check it out for them	6
10060	3521	Once they watch the movie, it @MONTH1 have some heavy language, sex-related humor or content	7
10061	3521	Then the child is learning and seeing all of this hapening in a motion picture	8
10062	3521	Also if they have nervous parents, the library could get some calls	9
10063	3521	Today, a lot of younger children about @NUM2+ have seen, watched, or read something that had profanity in it or inapropriate conduct in it	10
10064	3521	People have read some of the material that the library has and spotted some profanity not knowing it was in @CAPS1	11
10065	3521	If a religious man/woman checked out a book or a magazine from the library and spotted the profanity they put in a lot of these books and magazines, it would absolutely bother them	12
10066	3521	If they won't take them off of the shelves, the least they can do is keep a list of all of the materials that have heavy profanity, sex, and strong violence in them	13
10067	3521	They should do that so they can warn the person who is checking out the material	14
10068	3521	With all of the nasty things that are seen in books, movies, magazines, etc., people need to be alerted to what they read and watch	15
10069	3521	Some of the books can get pretty nasty and terrible with all of the things they say	16
10070	3521	Library materials must be checked	17
10071	3521	If they are found offensive, and proved offensive, they should be moved.	18
10072	3522	People have different opinions what one @MONTH1 find extremely offensive another @MONTH1 not care or even laugh at it	0
10073	3522	In this next paragraph I will explain the reasons why censorship should not be allowed in libraries	1
10074	3522	One of the first things is our freedom of speech	2
10075	3522	If we really have that freedom the censorship violates it completely	3
10076	3522	Some people are offensive but you must remember they are entitled to their opinion	4
10077	3522	They have a right to speak for what they belive in	5
10078	3522	Whether it be magazines, books, newspapers, movies, or music	6
10079	3522	The author or artist @MONTH1 use those to spread his/her ideas and beliefs	7
10080	3522	Another reason is people's opinions	8
10081	3522	Does one person really speak for an entire gender,country, culture, race, religion	9
10082	3522	Whether he/she is the lowest of the low or a person of great power, someone @MONTH1 believe different and miss out on something maybe they would have been inspired by or learned from	10
10083	3522	It is not right to deprive communication through these things	11
10084	3522	A man @MONTH1 find a book offensive to him or his family but another man just like him @MONTH1 find the book funny and joke about it	12
10085	3522	People think differently from each other	13
10086	3522	Personal experiences are also have a place	14
10087	3522	Maybe a near death experience causes someone to write a book	15
10088	3522	Maybe a bad break up causes someone to make a song	16
10089	3522	These help inspire people	17
10090	3522	No person can tell them it's wrong just because they thinks it's offensive or wrong	18
10091	3522	All this things factor in	19
10092	3522	No one person or group of people have a right to take away our freedom	20
10093	3522	I am against censorship in libraries and I hope you are too.	21
10094	3523	Does it ever come to mind when your child says they're going to the library to study, but in reality they could be going there to find books about murder, violence, or possibly helpful information	0
10095	3523	@DATE1 when searching through the library you never know what @CAPS3 will find on the shelves	1
10096	3523	Most of the topics of books, music, movies, or magazines are helpful	2
10097	3523	But there's always that one @CAPS2 that you don't want your child finding, or that one movie you just hope your child isn't watching	3
10098	3523	I strongly believe that the the types of topics like violence and murder should be taken off of the library shelves	4
10099	3523	When going to the library parents should be able to trust that their child is actually going there to study, not to look up bad books, movies, or magazines	5
10100	3523	Too many books and movies are showing that relying on violence is a good thing	6
10101	3523	For example when children are searching for a good book they aren't looking for something boring, they're looking for something that catches their eye	7
10102	3523	Most of these books resulting to violence	8
10103	3523	The more kids read about this, the more they think violence is okay	9
10104	3523	Also magazines like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or '@CAPS3 @CAPS2' are now showing stories of drugs use, teen pregnancy, or death of famous @CAPS3	10
10105	3523	@DATE1 our world has been increasing in the drug use of teens and adults, also the pregnancy rate of teens has went up dramatically in the past few years	11
10106	3523	These two things are not okay	12
10107	3523	I personally believe the reason these two topics have went up is because kids are thinking it's fine since they're reading about it in the new magazines, or seeing it on a tv, or reading about it in a book	13
10108	3523	Kids or teens are believing it's easy to have a child at such a young age, or using drugs is cool because all the hot famous @CAPS3 are using them, which is shown in the magazines and books	14
10109	3523	But what kids aren't understanding is that it's really not as easy or fun as the movies, books and magazines are making it sound	15
10110	3523	What happened to the library's that had information that was actually helpful in school	16
10111	3523	I understand that @CAPS3 are wanting to read about famous @CAPS3 and what's new with them	17
10112	3523	But when all of these types of books, magazines, and movies are put into our libraries it is limiting the amount of actual helpful information kids need for school or adults are needing for work	18
10113	3523	When I was younger,  I would go to the library and I either went thier to study or to check out a good book	19
10114	3523	Not a book about violence, murder, or teen precnancy	20
10115	3523	Kids need to be able to rely on the libraries for a good book or information that will help them in school, not on topics that don't relate to school at all	21
10116	3523	As author, Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'	22
10117	3523	I believe she is correct, these types of books, magazines, and movies that we don't want our kids finding need to be removed from the shelves of our libraries @DATE1	23
10118	3524	Who is to label a book offensive	0
10119	3524	What one might find appauling, others @MONTH1 find a novel or passage to be rather interesting	1
10120	3524	All books and other arts were created to be read and enjoyed by people	2
10121	3524	Libraries banning books, music, movies, or magazines seems unreasonable since there is such a wide variety of people and their interests	3
10122	3524	Books such as The @CAPS1, The @CAPS2's @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have been removed from many library shelves	4
10123	3524	Though people @MONTH1 check these books out, many others find them either offensive or think they should not mix with every day books	5
10124	3524	I have read a decent amount of each of the above readings, and have found the books to be full of remarkable things which have taught me a lot	6
10125	3524	If books are banned from libraries, it almost seems as if they're limiting our education	7
10126	3524	Why would a book be published, or written for that matter, if we were not intended to read it	8
10127	3524	Any book could be offensive to any one person	9
10128	3524	Any article, song, or film could be offensive	10
10129	3524	But, there will always be a crowd it appeals to	11
10130	3524	And that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word	12
10131	3524	Censorship in libraries has gone on too long, it is time for the world to freely take part in the literature that interests them	13
10132	3524	The solution to library censorship is the division of books into categories and sub-categories	14
10133	3524	First by subject, down to the author	15
10134	3524	Therefore, books that @MONTH1 be offensive are listed as such, but are still available to those who want to read them	16
10135	3524	Censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day	17
10136	3524	People should be able to read what they enjoy and not be ridiculed for it	18
10137	3524	All books are written to be read, and with the division of such books, everyone can agree upon this: books help us grow	19
10138	3524	Growth is not meant to be limited, nor is freedom.	20
10139	3525	People have a choice on the types of literature they want to read wether it offends them or not the chose to read it	0
10140	3525	Books should not be removed from the shelves of libraries.They need to try to avoid the books that @MONTH1 be offensive to them	1
10141	3525	Now if they cant then thats not the libraries fault	2
10142	3525	Books should not be removed for many reasons	3
10143	3525	One of the many reasons books should not be removed is because they know the risk they take when entering a library, and that's their decision that they are making and sometimes decisions have consequences	4
10144	3525	When and if they are offended, they will know the types of books that offened them so they would just have to do a little better job of avoiding those books	5
10145	3525	Another reason would be the libraries dont know what offends people it can be one little thing in a book but that doesn't mean that book should be removed from the shelfs	6
10146	3525	Also just cause one person tihnks its offensive doesn't mean that others will	7
10147	3525	People arn't all offended by the same thing some people are offended by little things, meaning they're offended easily, some arn't offended so easy, that means it make take more serious things than a book to offend a person	8
10148	3525	Another reason books shouldnt be removed is because students need them for projects and school assignments	9
10149	3525	Some school assignments require you getting a little offended exspecially if your african american and you get an assignment on slavery or something during that time	10
10150	3525	But we need to learn about past experiences and our history and we couldnt do that if some people are trying to remove some of those books from the shelf	11
10151	3525	You @MONTH1 get offended but there is no reason to remove that book that others will need at sometime.Find another way to solve that problem	12
10152	3525	There are other ways to solve problems like these such as tagging the books with a yellow small sticker so it would warn people that the book offended someone	13
10153	3525	There is no need to completly remove the book	14
10154	3525	Another solution would be to maybe seperate the books, meaning put the books in a diffrent location of the library if the get more than a couple complaints of being offensive	15
10155	3525	Also when someone check out a book the librarian can warn them that the book has been tagged with a yellow sticker and its possible that it @MONTH1 offend them	16
10156	3525	Thats why removing books from shelves arn't cause for.	17
10157	3526	Do you think that certain books, music, magazines are sometimes found very offensive	0
10158	3526	If I had kids I wouldnt want my kids to be around any of these bad things	1
10159	3526	I think that we should remove all of these bad things from the world to help the kids and childern become better people in the world	2
10160	3526	There are a lot of bad people in the world but it is mostly because of all the things that people read and see	3
10161	3526	When people like great singers sing about drugs and other stuff kids think that it is cool to do drugs so they start to do them and then they cant stop	4
10162	3526	You want everyone to go to college and be doctors but they cant if they follow things that everyone else does	5
10163	3526	We need to encourage our children to be great people but we cant with drugs and volience that goes on around them, but we can try to banned the bad books, movies, and music	6
10164	3526	We need more good things to influence our children	7
10165	3526	We dont want our chilren to look at magazines and see women that are really tiny and they think that they have to look like that to be popular	8
10166	3526	If your children what to read and listen to these things then you cant let it influence them	9
10167	3526	I listen to rap music all the time but i never let it influence me because i want to be successful in my life	10
10168	3526	These are all the reasons why be should banned these things from our children	11
10169	3526	If you want your children to be successful then you will keep your kids away from the volience and drugs	12
10170	3526	I know what kind of things happen when you dont keep them away	13
10171	3526	You dont want these things to happen to your kid so keep them away from it.	14
10172	3527	There are plenty of books that people don't want their children reading	0
10173	3527	Books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1' is a book I had read and it was very out there and straight forward	1
10174	3527	But I would have to disagree I think those books deserve to be read	2
10175	3527	It shows kids that not everything is perfect	3
10176	3527	People complain about how they think books are bad or things people say on @CAPS3 or in music is bad but if you don't want to listen to them, don't let your kids listen to it	4
10177	3527	If parents are so worried about what kids are reading or learning because of the world we live in now, lock them up	5
10178	3527	But I do have to agree with one thing, there are alot of bad things in muic and magazines but I think it can be avoided and not be caused to crupt a kid	6
10179	3527	I'm very into music and some music I dont listen to because of the things in it but I dont let that music or magazines change my option on things	7
10180	3527	I dont think people should be able to take books of the shelfs becaue it doesnt give other students or people to read them	8
10181	3527	Some people get inspired by books about drugs, not like to use them but to know that there are people out there that have overcome stitutions just like them	9
10182	3527	I like reading books about teenage problems and like to know all the different ways people have overcome them and see how they live	10
10183	3527	If people can get offended off of a book or movie I don't think they have a right to take that away	11
10184	3527	I think people that feel offended by books, magazines, and movies should stay away from them if they are offensive to them, because everyone has an option and not everyone thinks the same things	12
10185	3527	With all the bad or good movies or books out there, I'm certain someone at least feels offended by one or two books or movies but that isn't a reason to want to take it down	13
10186	3527	Because once you do that someone will take a book you thought wasn't offensive and it will make you mad	14
10187	3527	I think if people stayed away from things that offended them and stayed close to books that they liked we wouldn't have much of a conflict unless you get that picky, always wanting to start a fight person to find something else to be picky about with the books or magazines or movies	15
10188	3528	Do you think having inappropriate or offensive books, magazines, movies or music should be found in a public library	0
10189	3528	Some books could be very offensive to people and when they take their children or younger siblings to the library, they don't want them looking at that	1
10190	3528	Others prefer looking at it which would anger them if they were taken away	2
10191	3528	Not all parents find some of the things in libraries offensive, even if they @MONTH1 be	3
10192	3528	Having music, magazines, movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it	4
10193	3528	Even though having children look at something they shouldn't could be bad, it's also bad and unfair to those who only come to the library to view those things	5
10194	3528	It shouldn't be taken away from them	6
10195	3528	If parents don't want their children seeing those things, the shouldn't take them to that section	7
10196	3528	Some adults don't enjoy seeing it, which can be understandable	8
10197	3528	No matter what, someone wouldn't be very happy about the decision	9
10198	3528	In libraries, there is usually an adult section and kids section	10
10199	3528	If an adult doesn't want their child seeing something, they could simply take them to children's section where it won't be seen	11
10200	3528	In the children's section it's hard to find things that would be considered 'offensive' to adults	12
10201	3528	For the adults or teenagers who enjoy viewing these things, they could be in a section far away from the children	13
10202	3528	Taking things that people like away from someone is wrong and it would be mean to take that away from those who enjoy it	14
10203	3528	Recently, the world has been turning into something it shouldn't	15
10204	3528	Some of the most disgusting and cruel things happen every day and you could probably find this news in a library	16
10205	3528	It's understandable if you wouldn't want your child around that, but I it's wrong to take away those things from the people that love that stuff	17
10206	3528	For example, scary movies could be very disturbing and too violent for a young child but they could be an adults favorite thing to watch	18
10207	3528	Thats why, if you put the more offensive things in a different section, the kids wouldn't notice it was even there	19
10208	3528	If children were put into a different section, they wouldn't even notice the offensive things adults find	20
10209	3528	Taking away the things some adults @MONTH1 find offensive is like taking away the children's section, unfair	21
10210	3528	It wouldn't be fair to take away something that some adults or teenagers only come to the library for	22
10211	3528	Not all adults would understand both sides but I can see where both sides are coming from	23
10212	3528	If I had children I wouldn't want them seeinig things that are offensive, but I would keep them away from it instead of promoting against it	24
10213	3528	Having music, magazines movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it	25
10214	3529	There are millions of books and other media in libraries all across the world	0
10215	3529	Millions of people read and listen to those materials every day	1
10216	3529	Some people @MONTH1 like certain books or media and dislike others	2
10217	3529	Many people dislike certain materials because of their content	3
10218	3529	Everyone has the right to read and watch what they want and not everyone will read or watch the same materials	4
10219	3529	Although some materials @MONTH1 be offensive, they should not be removed from the libraries	5
10220	3529	Books and other media should not be removed from library shelves because what some people find offensive does not offend other people	6
10221	3529	Everyone has a right to their own beliefs and opinions	7
10222	3529	If someone wants to read a book or watch a video, they should be able to	8
10223	3529	What is offensive and what is not is a personal choice and it all depends on that person's point of view	9
10224	3529	If someone thinks the content in a book, song, or movie is offensive, then they should not read or listen to it	10
10225	3529	Materials should not be removed from libraries because they can be used to learn history and other things that people should know about	11
10226	3529	Take, for example, the @CAPS1	12
10227	3529	There are thousands of books on the @CAPS1 and many movies as well	13
10228	3529	These materials should not be removed from library shelves because even though some people find them offensive, they can be used to teach people how horrible it was so that it does not happen again	14
10229	3529	People should inform themselves about something before they view it so that they are not offended by the content inside	15
10230	3529	Some content in history is very mature and should only be viewed by mature audiences	16
10231	3529	The offensive content should not be removed from libraries because it is usually in a mature section and it has a right to be there	17
10232	3529	Most content that some people find offensive is for adult audiences	18
10233	3529	There are not children's books that talk about things that parents would find offensive to their children	19
10234	3529	The content has a right to be there	20
10235	3529	If the author or publisher took the the time to create the work, then they should recieve credit for making it	21
10236	3529	In the @LOCATION1, there is freedom of speech and people should be able to say what they want to say	22
10237	3529	If the content is too offensive then it should be removed but only under special circumstances	23
10238	3529	The content in libraries, offensive or not, should not be removed	24
10239	3529	People can read or watch whatever they want	25
10240	3529	Many people have many different opinions on what should and should not be in libraries	26
10241	3529	The libraries are public and they are shared	27
10242	3529	No one person has the right to dictate what should and should not be in libraries	28
10243	3529	If it was not for libraries, the people in society would not be as smart as they are	29
10244	3530	Have you ever wondered why a movie you rented from a library when you were younger, isn't there today	0
10245	3530	This is due to censorship	1
10246	3530	Libraries censor certain books if they believe them to be inappropriate for young children	2
10247	3530	Should censorship be allowed in libraries	3
10248	3530	Everyone has their own opinion, as do I, and I believe it should be allowed	4
10249	3530	Censoring books allows libraries to withhold books, movies, magazines, music, and more from children who are not quite mature enough to handle the contents within the material, rather it be curse words in a movie, book, or music, nudity shown in magazines, or fighting shown in a video game	5
10250	3530	Young children look for role models, someone to follow, therefore, more than likely they are going to repeat what they hear or see	6
10251	3530	Some children are not quite mature enough to understand that it's not alway 'okay' to repeat what you hear, some words are inapporopriate for young children	7
10252	3530	Maybe they saw that on a movie, a man or woman solved a problem he or she had by fighting, the young child @MONTH1 take the message the wrong way, and try and solve one of his or her problem by fighting	8
10253	3530	I believe that an age limit should be set for certain types of materials	9
10254	3530	Children that are under the age of @NUM1 should not be watching movies that are rated @CAPS1-@NUM1	10
10255	3530	There is a reason the rating is what it is	11
10256	3530	Just because your child is not allowed to rent/check out whatever the material @MONTH1 be, doesn't mean that you couldn't check it out, maybe go home and watch/listen/read/play it	12
10257	3530	If it doesn't seem to violent/graphic for your child then allow them to watch the movie, read the book, or play the game	13
10258	3530	That is your choice, but a library doesn't want to be blamed for your @NUM3 year old coming home cursing and fighting	14
10259	3530	My sister took my neice to the library once to rent a movie, it was a childrens movie, and my sister thought nothing harmful would come about it, but in one of the scenes, there was some arguing and fighting, and my neice began arguing with my sister, and hitting her, and my sister wasn't very pleased that they allowed that movie to be on the childrens floor of the library	15
10260	3530	Censorship is a wonderful thing to have in libraries	16
10261	3530	Maturity level for some children is just not quite high enough for them to see/watch/listen/play certain materials	17
10262	3530	Not only should censorship be allowed, it should be enforced	18
10263	3530	I believe all libraries should have to have censorship in their library	19
10264	3531	One @MONTH1 walk into a library, look over at a magzine rack and think, '@CAPS1 is that in the young adult section, the content of that book is not age appropriate?' In many libraries, some books are not censored and catagorized the way they should	0
10265	3531	In some of the reading material, one might not even realize that some inappropriate things are in it	1
10266	3531	Supervision of children and young adults are not always looked upon, and some of these people might not even know what they are checking out	2
10267	3531	Censorship needs to be pushed more in libraries	3
10268	3531	In most libraries, the catagories for books are children, young adult, adult books by genere, magazines, and music, but what needs looked upon is what is on the inside covers of those books	4
10269	3531	Some magazine articles are not appropriate for some teens, even if it does claim to be age appropriate	5
10270	3531	I remember when I was fourteen, I read a series that was related to colors off the color weel	6
10271	3531	Each one covered a different topic such as suicide, alcholism, drugs, sex, same sex dating, and jealousy	7
10272	3531	Looking back on it, I am surprised I was allowed to check them out at the library	8
10273	3531	A fourteen year old didn't need to read books on such heavy topics.Also, language in books and music maybe unappropriate for children, and @MONTH1 be distasteful and disrespectful for some adults	9
10274	3531	The catagories need to be catogorized even more, so people further know what they are getting into when checking out a book or magazine	10
10275	3531	When a child goes up to check out a book they found, a librarian sometimes doesn't even pay attention to the book they are getting, they simply check it out	11
10276	3531	Libraries should have a rating system like movies do	12
10277	3531	Generally people would not let their ten-year-old go to a movie rated @NUM1, @CAPS2 or that is unrated, so @CAPS1 would they let their child get a book holding the same content	13
10278	3531	If books had a rating system, that ten-year- old would not get their hands on a book rated '@CAPS2' or '@CAPS4' for mature	14
10279	3531	In libraries there is not as much supervision as their needs to be	15
10280	3531	I am aware that libraries are not day-care center and the librarians are not babysitters, but there also needs to be stricter guidelines, because some people are not fully aware of what their children or what they, themselves, are reading	16
10281	3531	For example, a thirteen-year-old girl wants to check out @CAPS5 magazine, because her best friend's older sister gets it	17
10282	3531	The girl's mother allows it because it probably won't be too bad and she assumes her daughter wants to look at the pictures of new clothes and trends	18
10283	3531	What the mother @MONTH1 not realize is in the middle of the magazine contains an article about sex and protection, and that @MONTH1 open a whole new world for the little girl	19
10284	3531	Even though the mother shouldn't have had let her daughter check out the magazine, if the guidelines were stricter at the library the girl might have never have read that article	20
10285	3531	Even if librarians had to check or scan a person's library card to make sure they can be in the section or be reading a certain book, it would be protecting many more people then it would be hurting	21
10286	3531	If libraries censored books better, then children and teens @MONTH1 not be reading things not age appropriate to them	22
10287	3531	I'@CAPS4 not saying that books should be removed off the shelf, just maybe put up higher, and be watched over more carefully	23
10288	3532	This essay is to describe my opinion on if certain materials that can be offensive, should be removed from shelves in libraries	0
10289	3532	I think that overall, anything taken as offensive to anybody should be taken out of libraries	1
10290	3532	I think that if they are very offensive, then they should be taken out	2
10291	3532	but if they are just mildly offensive, then i think they should stay	3
10292	3532	Because the library welcomes people of all ages, materials that can be taken offensive for children are most of the time not taken as offensive to adults	4
10293	3532	But since children go in there and can have access to anything in there, they can end up finding something that can be offensive	5
10294	3532	If a child finds something that their parents can be taken as offensive, then the library could possibly get sued and that would not be good	6
10295	3532	So if they just take any books, music, magazines, or movies that are not suitable for people of all ages, they can cut the risk of being sued	7
10296	3532	Libraries are meant to provide information anyways	8
10297	3532	They have no need for things that are offensive, because rarely something that is offensive, provides information	9
10298	3532	Libraries should just contain what they were made for: encyclopedias, dictionaries, books, and other books that can provide useful information to people	10
10299	3532	In conclusion I would say that materials that can be offensive to anyone of any age, should be taken out of libraries	11
10300	3532	Libraries are meant to provide information to people so I think thats all that they should have	12
10301	3533	Should books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive to public be removed	0
10302	3533	No,  I strongly disagree	1
10303	3533	Should books that @MONTH1 be offensive to others no because there are hundreds and thousands of different books and even more	2
10304	3533	All books have different themes and subjects and all readers have different opinions on them	3
10305	3533	For example say there is a book about abortions and you want to know more about this subject so you deside to check it out	4
10306	3533	In the line behind you is a women who tells you not to purchase this book because she disagrees with killing a baby and tells the owner to cancel this book for that reason	5
10307	3533	No this would not happen just because someone hates or dislikes something it could very well be something someone loves and enjoys	6
10308	3533	Here are some reasons why you would agree to removing somethings off the shelves like sex	7
10309	3533	Things such as sex @MONTH1 offend people because you @MONTH1 beileve it promotes sex to young teenagers or young kids but thats not the case	8
10310	3533	Most books on sex teaches you the right and wrong things to do and how to stay self	9
10311	3533	People need to understand that @PERCENT1 of teens world wide are sexually active and books that @MONTH1 help you to protect yourself and others	10
10312	3533	In conclusion there are many people that @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not like the books or other things that they find offensive but every one has there opinion	11
10313	3533	You cant take things away just because of one person that would not be far to a individual with a problem that is seeking help or information on there personal problem	12
10314	3533	For these reasons I disagree with taking away items that @MONTH1 be offensive to others because everyone is different in this world and that should not change because of a disagreement or opinion someone has on you.	13
10315	3534	No, I don't think that books or any other material should be taken off shelves in libraries just because some people might find them offensive	0
10316	3534	I think that if a parent sees something that they do not want their child reading, then it is in their right to not allow that child read it, but it is unfair to take it off the shelf entirely	1
10317	3534	That book that has been marked 'offensive' could have been a way for another person to learn about that book and possibly gain something out of it	2
10318	3534	There are some non-fiction books out there that can marked as 'offensive', and they are just that non-fiction	3
10319	3534	It is something that really happen and anyone can learn something from it by reading it, and to take it away would be taking away the knowledge that another person could have obtained	4
10320	3534	I believe that in a library people should have a choice to read what they choose and not have it ripped off the shelf just because parents don't want their child reading it	5
10321	3534	I think that if they do not want their child to read it, then the parents can tell that child that they don't want them reading that and then everybody wins	6
10322	3534	I know that I have read some non-fiction books that would be marked by some people as offensive, but with that book I also learned much about the topic at hand	7
10323	3534	To take away that book would be showing that you care only about how it might be offensive to some people and not how it could help extend the knowledge of another	8
10324	3534	If we are to take away every book that might have a racial slur here or an act of violence there, what would we have left our children to read and to learn from	9
10325	3534	They read these books and they can find out how that racial slur or act of violence as hurt someone emotionaly and physicaly, and that they should never do it in fear of the concicence that they might have to face later on	10
10326	3534	Overall, I think that the books and other material in libraries should be kept on the shelves, and if someone finds it offensive or anything else they shouldn't read it and not deprive someone of that knowledge	11
10327	3534	We live in a world today where education is everything, and we think that everyone should have an education	12
10328	3534	But if we take away every book that a person does not like then what do we have left to learn from.	13
10329	3535	Censorship in libraries is an inportant thing in schools and in the public	0
10330	3535	It is inportant beause some of movies, books, and magizines have a bigger influince on the kids then most people think	1
10331	3535	Like some of the really gory movies the are always people in the movie gettin cut up or shoot	2
10332	3535	Do you really think that some kids dont think about hat stuff	3
10333	3535	Somtimes the kids can get it in there head that they can do what they see or read	4
10334	3535	Like in the movie @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 they are beating up and killing people just because they are colored	5
10335	3535	And some kids @MONTH1 think that that is ok	6
10336	3535	And they can go down to there librarie and just get it off the shelf and check it out and go home and watch it	7
10337	3535	Now if you r using it as a thing to teach kid that it was the way things use to be and that it is wrong then that is ok	8
10338	3535	You can teach your kids all you want just make sure that it is the wright thing	9
10339	3535	And some magazines that are in the schools or in the public librarie are just not the kind of thing that kids should not be looking at	10
10340	3535	Like the gun magazines or the hunting magazines the just show that it is ok to carie a gun were ever they go	11
10341	3535	And the hunting magazines just show that you can go out and shoot stuff	12
10342	3535	And some kids @MONTH1 be confused that you need a lisense to do all of that	13
10343	3535	You have to at least put and age limmiet of some stuff	14
10344	3535	Go's the sameway with some of the books they always start out good and then the just turn into a big mess of gor and vileance	15
10345	3535	Like the spere it started out with a group of people going under water to explore a ship	16
10346	3535	And they find a big shpere and they go in it and get these powers and they imagin it and it comes true	17
10347	3535	Well when a kid reads that they @MONTH1 think that they can do that and they start imaging that they can eather hurt or really do some damage to someone	18
10348	3535	And then when they find out that it wont work they @MONTH1 do it to them themselves	19
10349	3535	So it just come to show that you should censor some of the stuff that you have in your libraries and if you can take them out then at least put and age limite on them	20
10350	3536	Do I think offensive materials should be removed from libraries	0
10351	3536	No, I think that if a person is offended by it then they should not get it	1
10352	3536	They should ignore it and find something else of interest to them	2
10353	3536	If the person complains about a book, music,movies or anything then they  should not go to the library	3
10354	3536	I think if people get offended over a book or something like that and complain, they shouldn't be aloud in the library	4
10355	3536	When I was in seventh grade we took a field trip to the city library	5
10356	3536	I thought it was fun because it looked awsome inside	6
10357	3536	I was walking around searching for a book about animals because all the seventh graders had to research an animal	7
10358	3536	When I was looking, I saw a guy yelling at one of the librarians	8
10359	3536	He was a guy of color and he was complaining because he read a book about slaves	9
10360	3536	He was offended by it cause his grandfather was a slave	10
10361	3536	I read the book and I thought there was nothing offeensive about it because it told about the slaves having to do hard work, then eventually they got free	11
10362	3536	My opinion is that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries	12
10363	3536	People that do not think they are offensive will read them	13
10364	3536	If a person thinks that a book is offensive then they should just walk away and find a different book	14
10365	3536	That's why I think offensive materials should not be removed from libraries.	15
10366	3537	Censorship in Libraries               Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 are many books, magazines, and movies out @CAPS1 that contain content not necessarily appropriate for young children	0
10367	3537	Part of a parent's job is to ensure their children are safe and looking at materials appropriate for their age level	1
10368	3537	However, this does not mean taking materials off of library shelves for everyone	2
10369	3537	Censorship in libraries rids people of their freedom to choose	3
10370	3537	Also, content that is inappropriate for children @MONTH1 be fine for adults to read	4
10371	3537	It is the responsibility of the parent to censor what their child takes off the shelf	5
10372	3537	All people of @LOCATION2 have certain rights allowing them to express themselves and to be free	6
10373	3537	People have the freedom to choose, whether it is books, magazines, movies, or music	7
10374	3537	Everyone is different and this causes the interests of each person to be different, also	8
10375	3537	Libraries offer a variety of materials and this allows people to choose what they want based on their interests	9
10376	3537	Censoring the content on the shelves of libraries @MONTH1 be a good idea for children, however adults have the right to choose what they want to take from the shelf	10
10377	3537	Would you like to have a portion of your freedom taken away	11
10378	3537	Censorship would greatly lower the freedom of everyone and their individuality	12
10379	3537	Furthermore, censoring what is on the shelves of libraries limits the range of materials that are available to patrons	13
10380	3537	@CAPS1 is content out @CAPS1 that children should not see	14
10381	3537	however adults have the right to choose what they want to read and come in contact with	15
10382	3537	Although certain materials are not meant for children to see, adults @MONTH1 find it enjoyable and interesting	16
10383	3537	Libraries offer a large range of materials and this allows people to express themselves and find entertainment	17
10384	3537	@CAPS1 are many different types of books and music out @CAPS1 and censoring these would greatly limit the variety	18
10385	3537	In addition, parents have the responsibility to watch over their children	19
10386	3537	They choose what @CAPS1 child wears, where they live, and where they attend school	20
10387	3537	It is no different when it comes to books, movies, and music	21
10388	3537	Each parent has a different style of parenting and they choose what works best for their child	22
10389	3537	If one parent finds something to be offensive or inappropriate, they shelter their children from it	23
10390	3537	However, another parent @MONTH1 not have a problem with it	24
10391	3537	The content children choose from library shelves should be at the discretion of the parent	25
10392	3537	Afterall, you cannot shelter children from everything	26
10393	3537	Censorship in libraries results in more problems than solutions	27
10394	3537	It rids patrons of their right to choose and their freedom	28
10395	3537	Censoring materials also greatly limits the variety of content available for people to choose from	29
10396	3537	It is not the responsibility of the law to choose what children can and cannot read, but rather the parent's job to watch over what they take off the shelf	30
10397	3537	As citizens of the @LOCATION1, we have rights and freedom allowing us to act as indivuals	31
10398	3537	Censoring the materials on library shelves results in very little materials left	32
10399	3537	As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books life on the shelf for any of us.	33
10400	3538	Censorship               Censorship is it needed in todays societey	0
10401	3538	Where things that were considerd bad @NUM1 even @NUM2 years ago are ok today to be veiwed read listened to and so on	1
10402	3538	Is it a  needed process or should libraries have free will to stock there shelves with what ever they seem fit to be there.Is it still a good process to use or is it a outdated uneeded resource that is now no longer needed	2
10403	3538	Everybody in todays soicitey says to read, but libraries @MONTH1 not have the type of litature that your are in to, so why would you want to read somthing that you do not like because the library dos not have the book that you wanted to to see i	3
10404	3538	I believe that censorshop in libraries should be their  to remove any book the find offenseive or immoral from there libary	4
10405	3538	I do not belive they should remove books becasue of  bad language, or somthing about god	5
10406	3538	I think that books or magazines or movies with '@CAPS1' content should be removed from libraries if they see it fit	6
10407	3538	Libraries should only feature books tht they want to have not ones that are popular but considerd 'bad' by the library	7
10408	3538	They should only have books they want to have	8
10409	3538	I do believe that their should be censorship in libarys	9
10410	3538	I just do not belive that it should be a harsh system	10
10411	3538	I think that they should set standards on what they want to have and following those standards on books they buy	11
10412	3538	I do think however that some libraries will set their standards to low or high that they wille ether have many books that are considerd 'bad', or no books at all	12
10413	3538	It is a very fine line when it comes to materials that the library has to be considerd good or bad	13
10414	3538	I think libraies should havea  set of standards nation wide to set what type of material is good for libraries	14
10415	3538	I believe that censorship is still a needed, and helpful process	15
10416	3538	I just think that it is to much of a opionated process	16
10417	3538	not enough facts or opions of the poeple	17
10418	3538	I think that is should remain in use for society i just belived it should be more under control then it is today.	18
10419	3539	Author Katherine Paterson proclaims, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf	0
10420	3539	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work i abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
10421	3539	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' A controversial issue in today's society are people's conflicting views on censorship in libraries	2
10422	3539	Many types of books, magazines, music, movies, and much more have been banned from being put on the shelves of libraries because of their content	3
10423	3539	From personal experience, observations, and reading of the issue censorship should not be allowed in libraries	4
10424	3539	The shelves of libraries will soon be empty if censorship continues	5
10425	3539	Certain readings, and types of entertainment have already begun to disappear one by one	6
10426	3539	It is understandable if one person does not agree with the material being placed into these books, but why should they ruin the entertainment for everyone else	7
10427	3539	From my own experience, people in my elementary school were not able to enjoy reading a popular series of books at that time period	8
10428	3539	Since I went to a @CAPS1 school, the priest at the corresponding church during that time decided he did not agree with the content in this certain series of books	9
10429	3539	As a result, he took charge and made the staff of the school remove those books from our school library, and no student was allowed to come to school with one of those types of books	10
10430	3539	If it had been up to him, he would have decided to go ahead and take out all those books from everywhere in the world	11
10431	3539	Just because one individual does not agree on the content of that book, they should not be able to have the power to banish the lovely leisure for the rest of the population	12
10432	3539	Authors and artists of books, movies, and music have the freedom to put into them whatever they choose	13
10433	3539	It should not be up to their audience to decide whether or not it is appropriate	14
10434	3539	The concept is quite simple	15
10435	3539	if the reader or viewer does not think they would agree with the work, then they should not spend their time to read or view the pieces at hand	16
10436	3539	Just because they might not completely think what the content entails is necessarily appropriate, someone else might enjoy it	17
10437	3539	Censorship is wrong for this very reason	18
10438	3539	The creators of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it to	19
10439	3539	The audience they are trying to appeal to @MONTH1 not have the same taste in style as someone who the work was not necessarily meant to have their own opinion on the matter	20
10440	3539	Books should not be able to be taken out of libraries because what one person might think is not appropriate to be placed into public, another person @MONTH1 enjoy thouroughly	21
10441	3539	Likewise, if the content of a work of literature does not appeal to an individual then it should just simply not be read by that person	22
10442	3539	As humans, there is the freedom of choice as to what people would like to read, and what they would not like to indulge in	23
10443	3539	So make the correct choice in deciding what you want to read, and do not ruin the enjoyment for many others	24
10444	3539	In a great deal of different types of literature censorship is touched on by the authors	25
10445	3539	For example, in the popular prize-winning novel, @CAPS2 @NUM1, books are burned, or 'censored' because they contain information people should not be aware of in that period of time	26
10446	3539	However, in today's world books are a major type of entertainment and are important in the knowledge of everyone	27
10447	3539	Books provide so much information on almost every subject known to human-kind that it would be such a dramatic loss if now books were burned if caught reading one	28
10448	3539	Paterson does point out that everyone has a right to their own opinion of this matter, but if people do not take the right approach to solving this situation, there will be no books left on library shelves for several generations after to enjoy for themselves	29
10449	3539	Every individual has their own right to be able to read books and absorb all the wonders and knowledge they contain	30
10450	3539	As a result of the growing awareness of censorship in today's libraries, people @MONTH1 never be able to enjoy certain types of books, movies, music, and magazines	31
10451	3539	From my own past experiences on this situation I know how wrong it is to take away someone's own privelage to enjoy types of literature	32
10452	3539	People should not have a say whether something is appropriate or not to be taken out of libraries	33
10453	3539	If the individual does not simply agree with the specific content of the work then they need to accept it and move on instead of causing millions of others to not enjoy it	34
10454	3539	Also, from different types of reading, censorship has definitely become a serious issue, but it should be abolished	35
10455	3539	Keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves	36
10456	3540	Censorship is a law and it is commonly broken	0
10457	3540	You cannot censor any books, movies, music, or magazines	1
10458	3540	The law of censorship is usually broken in libraries	2
10459	3540	I feel that censorship affects the writers and school system	3
10460	3540	In the US people have the right to expressed their beliefs and feelings on any type of topic that is brought up	4
10461	3540	Many libraries are taking away the right of that by not allowing certain books to not be read in classes or not allowing the students to watch certain types of movies	5
10462	3540	I think that this would offend the person whom wrote the book or the writter of the script for a movie	6
10463	3540	If they librarian doesn't want a certain type of book in her library then she shouldn't have that job or she shouldn't have books at all	7
10464	3540	Just because she doesn't like the genre of books doesn't mean that somebody else who comes in won't want to read it	8
10465	3540	If a teacher doesn't want her class to see a movie because it's something that she doesn't like then she shouldn't even show movies at all in her class	9
10466	3540	In school we aren't allowed to read about certain topics in the library, because the school system feels that it is bad for us to know about	10
10467	3540	If we want to learn about something we should be able to	11
10468	3540	Maybe we don't want to learn about something the teacher is teaching us about	12
10469	3540	Do we take away everything the teacher used to learn about that topic	13
10470	3540	Do we take the teacher out of the classroom	14
10471	3540	No	15
10472	3540	We show respect and we read what they want us to read about and we listen to what they have to say about the topic	16
10473	3540	It's respect, we learnt that in kindergarden	17
10474	3540	I think that they should show us respect to and let us read and watch movies about the genres of books and movies they take away from us	18
10475	3540	Censorship is illegal where we live	19
10476	3540	But why isn't it taken seriously by the government	20
10477	3540	I think that they need to realize that what they are allowing is discrimonation to the writer	21
10478	3540	We get in trouble if we virbally discrimonate somebody	22
10479	3540	So why are they not doing anything about the physical discrimonation	23
10480	3540	We should be able to have higher knowledge on a topic we feel the need to learn about	24
10481	3540	I think this law should actually be enforced instead of ignored	25
10482	3540	It isn't fair to us or the writter.	26
10483	3541	Do you think that books that have vulgar things in them should be on libaries shelfs	0
10484	3541	We all know that there are books out there are parents hope we never get a hold of	1
10485	3541	In this time try and find a good action movie without cuss words in it	2
10486	3541	It is nearly immposible to do that	3
10487	3541	Just because books have vulgar language, blood and gour, and sexual things, doesn't mean they should be pulled off the shelf	4
10488	3541	Have you seen the banned book list lately	5
10489	3541	I have and some of those books on there are ridciolus	6
10490	3541	Here are a few @PERSON2, @PERSON1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 @PERSON2's @CAPS4	7
10491	3541	I could go on and on, the list is a mile long	8
10492	3541	Some of these books have historical meanings behind them	9
10493	3541	There is also morals behind them	10
10494	3541	I think that books should not be pulled from the self because they have a few bad words in them	11
10495	3541	It's not liuke we have never heard them words	12
10496	3541	In @CAPS3 @PERSON2's @CAPS4 they have banned it from schyools because of the use of the word 'nigger'	13
10497	3541	This is not a nice word in our day and time	14
10498	3541	Back when we had slaves that is what they were called	15
10499	3541	It is points and views from an anti-slavery author	16
10500	3541	In @CAPS7 @CAPS8 it is banned because of animals talking	17
10501	3541	Come on really they have animals in movies that talk all the time	18
10502	3541	I belive that if kids don't no that animals cant really talk we might have problems	19
10503	3541	Do you find the show @PERSON3 the @CAPS9 offensive	20
10504	3541	Well it has been banned because @CAPS10 is racit against @CAPS11	21
10505	3541	I would like to no how some of these people come up with this at	22
10506	3541	Whoever picks up this offensive matrial has a choice wheater or not they read it	23
10507	3541	It should be on the shelf even if it is offensive	24
10508	3541	I belive that it is totally up to you, if you read it	25
10509	3541	Just like if you go to a mvie store they have the movies rated	26
10510	3541	You dont want to watch rated @CAPS12 movies then dont rent it	27
10511	3541	They could use the same method with books	28
10512	3541	Do you still think offensive books should be pulled from shelfs	29
10513	3541	If you say yes, I would like to no why	30
10514	3541	It is your choice to read it	31
10515	3541	There are already all these other banned books out there why ban any more	32
10516	3541	Just because books have vulgar lanuage, blood and gour, and sexual things, doesn't mean they should be pulled from shelfs.	33
10517	3542	I think censorship in libraries is wrong	0
10518	3542	Books, movies, and magazines are ment to inlighten, inform, and entertain the reads	1
10519	3542	If you find something offensive in the book, movie, or even the magazine doesn't mean the next person will	2
10520	3542	If you don't want your child reading or watching those things, then limit what they watch or read, don't make the people who don't have a problem with what their reading or watching suffur	3
10521	3542	They have the same right to have those books, movies, and magazines on the shelves as you do	4
10522	3542	There has been times when I've wanted a book, but the libaray won't get it because of the adult content in the book	5
10523	3542	Yet I was raised reading those book, so to me it wasn't adult content	6
10524	3542	The same goes with the movies, I was allowed to watch rated @CAPS1 movies when I was eight years old	7
10525	3542	Yet movies have ratings that tell you if it's of for a child or adult, like @NUM1 to rated @CAPS1	8
10526	3542	The libaray has the same works, a child cannot rent a movie rated @CAPS1 without a parent present to get it for them, same goes for a movie theater	9
10527	3542	Parent who are worried about their childrens well being, shouldn't make libraries take books, movies, and magazines off the shelves, because of things they find offensive	10
10528	3542	Other people who pay taxes for those books, movies, and magazines would like to read them as much as the next one, like some libraries bann 'The @CAPS4 of @PERSON1', because of the way the story is written	11
10529	3542	Someone found it offensive and gathered a lot of other people, whom didn't read the book but took the word from the person who did, and banned the book	12
10530	3542	If they had read the book they'd would have understood, it wasn't ment to be offensive, but a fictional story of @CAPS4	13
10531	3542	I remember living in a town, with a lot of christin people, so the libraries only had christin books	14
10532	3542	When I went to the libraren and asked for a series of books, and was always turned down, because of the christin population	15
10533	3542	I told them 'I have as much rights too have those books on the shelve, as they have to have their books on the shelves.' I never got those books, but maybe someday they will look back on those requests and think of way they should have gotten them	16
10534	3542	The reason I think censorship is wrong, is because no one should be able to tell people what they should read or watch	17
10535	3542	When they pay the same taxes everyone does to have those books and movies on the libraries shelves	18
10536	3542	If you have a problem with what your child watches and reads, than limit what your child reads and watches	19
10537	3542	Don't take away other people rights to read and watch what they want.	20
10538	3543	In Katherine Paterson's writing she tells us that she does not want her child to pick up a book off the shelf that could be found offensive	0
10539	3543	But I think that there should be sections of the library that are cut off away from the public eye, but are still there for those certin people	1
10540	3543	If my child were to pick up a book that was not for his/or her age group I would not get made, because I know that some of the book groups are close to others them some, but they are for everyone to see, which could be offensive to some	2
10541	3543	I would tell my son/ or daughter that that book is not for you, and we would go and pick out a new book to read	3
10542	3543	Over all I think that there should be sections of the library that are made for a certin age group, and should not be seen by kids	4
10543	3543	Because once I was that little kid, and went wondering through the miles of shelfs to find a really wonderful book to read, but long behold that didn't happen, I had wondered along to find a book that was not in my age group	5
10544	3543	So I think that there needs to be more careful eyes in the library staff to make sure that those kind of things will never happen again.	6
10545	3544	There are some movies,books,music,etc that @MONTH1 be found  offensive toward some people.I feel that if you are at the          appropriate age for a type of literature you should be able to observe it.If you read a book and you find it offensive,then      you shouldn't have read the book.Books,music,and movies are made to entertain you,however,if you are not entertained then what you're reading or watching is not for you	0
10546	3544	I have had an experience in which I was offended by a movie I watched.It degraded women in which they were beaten and were treated as slaves.I was offended because as I watched the movie,and I realized that these women were someone's daughter and mother.I wouldn't agree with my mother being treated that way,also I wouldn't want any other woman being treated that way either.After I watched the movie,I went and informed my mother on how that movie offended me.I am sure that the authors who write the books intentions aren't to offend the reader,however,there @MONTH1 be a way that they can restate things that they say.I know that people have their own opinion,and that people think differently.If it is obvious that the reader's intentions are to offend the reader then you shouldn't purchase a book like that.If you find a book on the shelf,and you find it offensive,it shouldn't have to be removed from the shelf.Another person @MONTH1 read the book ,and they might like it.Everyone has their own way of thinking,and how they absorb information.It @MONTH1 be offensive to the reader,but someone else @MONTH1 recieve the book and admire it	1
10547	3544	In conclusion,I feel that if you are offended by a certain book,type of music,or movie you should learn from the movie,and explain why it offended you.If a parent is offended they shouldn't allow their children to observe it as well.It will have a negative effect on your child.Books,music,movie,etc are made to entertain,not to offend.	2
10548	3545	I believe that censorship is a very debatable subject for many.But I think that I have a pretty good outlook , and a pretty good view on this	0
10549	3545	In this essay I'm going to give you my reasoning, and explain , and give some reasons why I think censorship is a good thing , and should maybe be inforced heavier	1
10550	3545	Censorship	2
10551	3545	Should books, music, movies , magazines, etc	3
10552	3545	be taken off the shelf.	4
10553	3545	I believe that it is @LOCATION1 , and everyone should have their right to read what they want to,  and what they don't 	5
10554	3545	I believe , that if someone want's to read something vulgur , then let them	6
10555	3545	If they are an adult , it's their choice	7
10556	3545	I think as far as the child part of it , that no , children should not be aloud to read things that @MONTH1 be vulgar, sexual , etc	8
10557	3545	In keeping children away from these vulgar things , they should have,or keep seperate sections for kids, and adults	9
10558	3545	I dont think that children should be able to have the access, and maybe they won't know about it, or want it	10
10559	3545	If their parents think it's okay , and want to let them read it, or watch it, or listen to it,  that before they become an adult they will have to get it for them	11
10560	3545	I don't believe that children should be candy coated, and blind to the world, I just believe that there is a certain extent to what they need to be limited to	12
10561	3545	I obviously think that censorship is a good thing	13
10562	3545	I think if there was more of it, I think there would be less crime	14
10563	3545	Kids are learning this , they're watching as young as god knows what, thinking it's okay from the start, and are growing up with that picture ,and message ,of them thinking it's okay  	15
10564	3545	No I am not saying that all kids learn everything from t.v., etc	16
10565	3545	,and yes some @MONTH1 argue that kids dont copy what's on t.v	17
10566	3545	at all 	18
10567	3545	But I think that t.v	19
10568	3545	, books, and music affect alot of how children view the world	20
10569	3545	As much as I love rap music , and movies such as A.T.L ,rappers such as @ORGANIZATION1, even sometimes when I watch, or listen to those things, it kind of makes me feel like being jaded, and kind of makes me feel like I want to have a bad attitude towards the world, it makes me feel like I wanna live that hard life like that	21
10570	3545	I think that music , books, what we watch on t.v	22
10571	3545	, and what we read in the magazines , have a big affect	23
10572	3545	Such as if we watch the news and there's something depressing, it kind of makes you in a bad mood , or sad or depressed	24
10573	3545	The media ,music , t.v., books , magazines, etc., affect our mood, our actions, and even sometimes the way we talk, and dress	25
10574	3545	I am not saying that dressing that more urban feel is a bad thing , I am just saying when you start doing crime, and drugs because of it, it's a problem	26
10575	3545	I believe that children should only be censored and not adults, because at the point when u reach adult-hood , your pretty much set in your way's, and have a pretty good look out on what you should be doing, and how you want thing's done	27
10576	3545	Children are still machuring ,and are like a sponge	28
10577	3545	Censorship , is a very sensitive , and argumentable/debatable issue, but this is just my view, whats yours ?	29
10578	3546	To whom it @MONTH1 concern	0
10579	3546	As a student, I find myself reading frequently: at home, at school, in the library, in the car, basically any place I can get my hands on a novel	1
10580	3546	However, the novels that I have read are not always novels I have chosen for my personal gain	2
10581	3546	I must admit, I am not an avid reader on my own	3
10582	3546	I am the kind of student that enjoys reading a book that interests me	4
10583	3546	Many of the books I choose are relatable to reality, which often involves content that @MONTH1 be considered explicit	5
10584	3546	I believe books, magazines, movies, music, etc	6
10585	3546	should not be taken off shelves	7
10586	3546	As @CAPS1 citizens, we have the right to free speech	8
10587	3546	This allows us the freedom to speak our mind and express our thoughts without restricting our personalities.This law allows authors and producers the right to base their work on what they want	9
10588	3546	Media that @MONTH1 be considered explicit is appealing to a variety of people, and to some it is considered disturbing	10
10589	3546	With the freedom we have as @CAPS2, we have the choice to see said movies, or read said books, but we also have the choice to avoid those situations	11
10590	3546	When producers produce movies containing sexual content, language, or violence, they aren't producing the movie, expecting every citizen to see it	12
10591	3546	They know some citizens are against that content	13
10592	3546	There is no law forcing us to see movies that we do not desire to see	14
10593	3546	We have the ability to choose what we want and do not want	15
10594	3546	Explicit material is available everywhere you look	16
10595	3546	Walking in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, we see books, music, and magazines lining the walls, most containing explicit material	17
10596	3546	Though many novels contain explicit material, there are still numerous amounts that do not	18
10597	3546	People complain about explicit content in novels when in actuality, there are many novels without explicit content	19
10598	3546	We are trained as humans to look for the bad in situations	20
10599	3546	We lead pessimistic lifestyles	21
10600	3546	Citizens need to learn to realize not everything is terrible	22
10601	3546	Look for the good in situations	23
10602	3546	There is an abundance of media that contains no explicit content or sexual material and we are given warnings as to what contains and does not contain this material	24
10603	3546	These warnings are required	25
10604	3546	Labels such as @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 are set to prove that the following is open for general audiences with and without parental supervision	26
10605	3546	Parents have the authority to monitor what their child involves himself or herself in	27
10606	3546	They can set rules for their children, saying they @MONTH1 only see @CAPS3 rated movies, or they have to have parental consent to read a magazine or novel	28
10607	3546	Parents are guardians for a reason	29
10608	3546	they need to monitor their child and care for him or her	30
10609	3546	If they do not like the music, novels, movies, etc	31
10610	3546	that their child watches, change it	32
10611	3546	They have the authority and right to do so	33
10612	3546	Instead of taking explicit material off the market to everyone, limit what you, personally, want to be off limits to your family on your own, and talk to them about it	34
10613	3546	Katherine Paterson is completely correct when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf	35
10614	3546	then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	36
10615	3546	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we were given the right to remove and books, movies, magazines, etc	37
10616	3546	that we do not believe should be on the market, it is likely that we would have no media anymore	38
10617	3546	With the billions of citizens we have in @LOCATION1 alone, each individual is bound to find some flaw in a certain book	39
10618	3546	With each flaw found, we would want to eliminate that book, movie, or magazine from society, thus leaving us with no variety of material to choose from	40
10619	3546	People who feel strongly about eliminating explicit material would act quickly upon this law, rather than people who are against it	41
10620	3546	This would create a corrupt society, with a lot of fighting	42
10621	3546	We, as humans, enjoy the freedoms we are given and the choices we are allowed to make	43
10622	3546	Taking the freedom of what we read or watch away from us would take away or personality and sense of expression	44
10623	3546	Books, movies, and magazines are meant to be read based on opinion, and it should remain that way	45
10624	3546	Books, movies, and magazines should be allowed to stay on the market even when they include explicit material	46
10625	3546	The choice to read or watch this material is up to the person, and should have no influence on other humans opinions.	47
10626	3547	To who @CAPS3 @MONTH1 consern,         I belive that books,movies, and magazines should not beremoved from the shelfs of a library if they are found offensive	0
10627	3547	@CAPS2 books @MONTH1 seem offinsive to @CAPS2 people but to others there prospective is a lot different	1
10628	3547	I belive that if books or other things are found offinseive they should have  a speacial place for them, to where mature people will be able to read them	2
10629	3547	Books are very valuable to most people in the united states	3
10630	3547	Many people love to read stuff that other people might find offensive	4
10631	3547	But is @CAPS3  really wrong for them to like something that someone else took the time to write	5
10632	3547	Just because one person  reads a book or magazine and they find something in there that they do not like they call @CAPS3 offensive	6
10633	3547	I have a feeling that alot more people would feel the same way	7
10634	3547	Along with movies,and etc	8
10635	3547	I feel like none of them should be removed from the shelves of a library	9
10636	3547	There are kids sections, @CAPS1 sections, And even a teenage section	10
10637	3547	I feel like parents now in days dont want thier children to learn about stuff early in life	11
10638	3547	But i still feel like if they did not want there kids reading @CAPS3 then dont let them	12
10639	3547	If there ever was a need to really look at something and give @CAPS3 another chance this  would be the topic right here	13
10640	3547	Libraries all over the world are all neat and organized	14
10641	3547	So why could they not make a section just for books, movies, magazines that people find offinsive	15
10642	3547	Sure @CAPS3 might take a little bit more work but hey, @CAPS2 one has to do @CAPS3	16
10643	3547	As you can see these are really good reason why they should not remove stuff that other people find offinsive  from  libraries	17
10644	3547	I mean half of the stuff they find any way are based on true stories or they are biographys	18
10645	3547	People really do enjoy alot of these books and even movies,or magazines	19
10646	3547	@CAPS3 would be really great if this could happen, @CAPS3 would make a lot of people happy and satisfide.	20
10647	3548	Do I believe that vertain materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries if found offensive	0
10648	3548	I believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the different styles of what people like	1
10649	3548	Censorship should not play a role because everyone has their own opinions on what is looked at as offensive and what is not	2
10650	3548	By giving everyone the freedom to enjoy what they like will make alot of people happier	3
10651	3548	The wants and needs of people varie from one extreme to the other	4
10652	3548	What one person loves, another @MONTH1 hate	5
10653	3548	This should not play a role in whether or not materials should be removed from public places such as a library	6
10654	3548	Everyone has the right to express themselves through art in their own way	7
10655	3548	Taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it	8
10656	3548	By doing this, not all people will be satisfied when not everyone gets what they want	9
10657	3548	Censorship should not take part in any library	10
10658	3548	Entertainment can not always please everyone	11
10659	3548	It will be judged in many ways no matter what anyone has to say, so the problem should just be left alone	12
10660	3548	Arguing to take away the material that some like will only cause tension to rise and make matters worse	13
10661	3548	It is understandable, for example, that a parent would not want their child to be able to be welcomed into the media world where not everything has postive influences	14
10662	3548	That's life though and not everyone has th same outlook on it	15
10663	3548	You have to think of others, and respect their view of it all as well	16
10664	3548	Opinons will vary with what I have had to say	17
10665	3548	I strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in	18
10666	3548	Censorship definitely has its positives and negatives, but for the most part it is wrong and should not have a role in any library	19
10667	3548	Cutting down people's availability to their interests will only lead to frustration	20
10668	3548	You can not please everyone, so in that case, censorship will just have to be looked beyond.	21
10669	3549	Libraries hold many books and movies such as fiction, nonfiction, historical, fantasy, and adventure	0
10670	3549	These books have many different styles and portrails and many of these @MONTH1 be takeno offensive but that doesn't mean that they can just be taken off the shelf	1
10671	3549	One book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'	2
10672	3549	This book talks about blacks as slaves and how they should be whipped for being let go and it call them @ORGANIZATION1 offensive names yet it is a classic and is in almost every book store or library in the country	3
10673	3549	Why, because it was written back when slavery was legl and slaves were treated as property not people	4
10674	3549	A movie that many people have seen recently is slumdog @CAPS4	5
10675	3549	This movie has a boy from a slum being tortured because he knows the answers to the questions on the gameshow '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be a @CAPS4?'	6
10676	3549	Many indians @CAPS2 are smarter could be offended by this because they are saying if you grow up in a slum you can't be smart	7
10677	3549	But, people blow it off because it is a movie so it isn't real	8
10678	3549	But if you go to somepeople and ask them about these books are movies some will say they are @ORGANIZATION1 good others might be offended so they might as weel stay on the shelfs	9
10679	3549	The book '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' is a book about the civil war could this be scene as offensive showing the thoughts of both sides saying slavery is good and bad at the same time yet it is another classic and will stay on the book shelfs	10
10680	3549	So books in libraries shouldn't be censroed because of being offensive to a race, sex, or group	11
10681	3549	they should stay on the shelf because every books other tahn some childrens books have something offensive	12
10682	3549	Thus if we took books off the shelfs for being offensive their would be nothing to read except for 'The @ORGANIZATION1'!	13
10683	3550	Would you ever read a book about the @CAPS1 times if your @CAPS2	0
10684	3550	Are you going to read about how people of your religion and maybe even your family were tortured	1
10685	3550	Probably not	2
10686	3550	If your a colored man/woman, are you going to engage in a book that talks about slavery	3
10687	3550	Not likely	4
10688	3550	How about if you are a mother, are you going to want to read a novel or magazine about abortion	5
10689	3550	Are you going to let your child read that book	6
10690	3550	Of course not	7
10691	3550	So you are probably wondering why they are even on the shelves, right	8
10692	3550	Its on the shelves for basically one reason, to drownd us in the knowledge it holds	9
10693	3550	Whether we are learning about criminals, racism, or wars, there is always going to be one person who is against it all	10
10694	3550	When we read, we find books that are to our own enjoyment, we look for books that can spark ideas and images in our heads	11
10695	3550	Most of us however, don't quite understand why others refuse to read such a book or even hold in their hands a book that is different from all their beliefs	12
10696	3550	Beliefs are important to people no matter their age, gender, sexuality, or their race	13
10697	3550	Its just a way of life	14
10698	3550	Some stories are there for our entertainment, some catch our emotions, and some our there for our knowledge	15
10699	3550	When authors write, they usually think of events that have happend or what they predict could happen in the future	16
10700	3550	Authors try to get you to understand the world around you, not by trying to offend you in anyway	17
10701	3550	Books tend to affect people in many ways, possitive and yes, sometimes negative	18
10702	3550	Its something they can't really control though, so you can't really blame anyone for you being offended	19
10703	3550	I don't agree that libraries shouldn't have these books on their shelves, I think they are good for us	20
10704	3550	No, i don't mean we should go around eating books	21
10705	3550	We should take time to read some of those so called offensive books	22
10706	3550	You are probably thinking, there is no way I'm going to pick up that type of book and sit down and read it	23
10707	3550	However, let me tell you that if we read these books, the more people will understand about how terrible times were back then and how some things are still bad	24
10708	3550	Take abortion into perspective	25
10709	3550	Books about abortion give us an idea about how horrible it is or how it can not only effect the women who go through with it	26
10710	3550	It appeals to the emotions of others in a way that makes them think twice about lifes decisions	27
10711	3550	Books should be kept on the shelves for our own well-being	28
10712	3550	When it comes down to the choice, you will know just what to do	29
10713	3550	You know how useful books are in helping us see the differece between right and wrong	30
10714	3550	You understand why books are placed on shelves for in the first place, no its not for the money	31
10715	3550	I know that you are going to understand what I'm trying to tell you	32
10716	3550	Now head on over to your library and pick up a book about something you would like to no more about	33
10717	3550	Who knows, maybe you will get a book that makes you think twice about what information is held in between the bindings	34
10718	3551	In my opinion,  I do not believe that anyone has a choice in what children or any other age group chooses to read	0
10719	3551	It is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong	1
10720	3551	When society says that every single child is not allowed to read a certain book, or listen to a certain song just because it is found offensive to some people	2
10721	3551	There are laws against restricting what a person can or can not view	3
10722	3551	There is a level of media that is not as appropriate as it should be but that does not mean it has to go away completely	4
10723	3551	Some of the reasons society can not sensor everything are because of the fact that not everone is offended by everything, it is up to the parent of the child to say what is right or wrong, and lastly individuality is comprimised if the choices we have are limited	5
10724	3551	When someone gets offeneded by the media that is out there, that does not neccessarily mean that another person is also offended	6
10725	3551	When I do not like a video, or a book, or any other type of content, someone else should not have that content censorded because my opinion is in the way of what they enjoy	7
10726	3551	I know that personally I would not want someone to take away my favorite book so my child could not read it	8
10727	3551	Content that is out in the public will always be unsafe to read by someone else's views	9
10728	3551	Just like I will not believe in what other people believe in, but, I will see that it is valued by others and should not remain a censored topic	10
10729	3551	Books that are considered inappropriate, should be decided to has censoreship by the parents of a young child	11
10730	3551	Decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views	12
10731	3551	Whe children are growing up and are taught the values that know today, it is their parents that teach them and not a society full of people which have different kinds of opinions	13
10732	3551	There is a saying by an author and it says 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' and all that means if we all would have the power to remove a book or any other content from the shelf that we do not like then their would not be any books left	14
10733	3551	I believ in that saying and I also believe that many others will as well	15
10734	3551	Individualaity is when one person has differnt traits of feelings than another human being	16
10735	3551	We all have choices of the books we read and the musice we listen to and that is why we all have individuality	17
10736	3551	When people start to thnk that they are allowed to remove a certain song or book because that is not what they want other people to see, then everyone will do the same and no one would have that song they enjoy or the traits that make them differnt because they are the only one that likes that song	18
10737	3551	If there were not any of us left on this earth that has something that they enjoyed and no one else that also enjoyed the same thing, then we would all be pretty boring	19
10738	3551	I have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases	20
10739	3551	Also from experience I have learned that a boom that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling	21
10740	3551	I would not want the same happen to all of the other books in the world	22
10741	3551	It is a very good thing to practice the art of understading, and to have an open mind when it comes to a certain material that another person happens to enjoy	23
10742	3551	In the future, when I find a book that @MONTH1 not be a book I would want my children to read, I will just let the topic go and remember that everyone has their own opinions	24
10743	3551	So in conclusion I just want to let everyone know that books that are seen as inappropriate or offensive to one person, @MONTH1 be seen as a good thing to another.	25
10744	3552	Take it @CAPS1	0
10745	3552	How do you take it when people come out with magazines, movies, or music that is extremely offensive to you	1
10746	3552	How can you stop your children or the younger generation from watching these things	2
10747	3552	The truth is we can not stop them, their is so much of the pornography and bad music out in this world that your can get it anywhere	3
10748	3552	It is all over the internet and you can't control that	4
10749	3552	If I find something very offensive in a store or online I should have the right to voice my opinion, and that opinion should be taken seriously	5
10750	3552	They shouldn't have inappropiate things in public stores or places children can go	6
10751	3552	That is not right and it is setting a terrible example for the kids	7
10752	3552	Some people should just know better and take it @CAPS1	8
10753	3552	Almost every day that i go online, i see something on the side of the website advertising some kinda of pornograghy site	9
10754	3552	Its unbelievible how that is allowed on public websites for everyone to see	10
10755	3552	If they're going to continue to do this, @CAPS2 needs to be some law saying they can not on public sites	11
10756	3552	I see things of half naked ladies on the side of the website and i know thats not okay for young kids to be seeing at those ages	12
10757	3552	I understand a lot of things in this world is about money and people make money by selling things to others	13
10758	3552	Selling movies, magazines, and music saying or doing things that are rebelious is easy money for opper teens and older people	14
10759	3552	They can still make good money if they were to make funny stuff instead of pornography things, everyone loves to watch, read, or listening to something funny	15
10760	3552	So basicly we aren't going to stop this completely and you all should know that	16
10761	3552	the best thing we can do is protest it and hope that it will start fading from the public some day	17
10762	3552	It should die down eventually	18
10763	3552	We can only hope for the best	19
10764	3553	Libraries have always had interesting materials, such as, books, music, movies, and magazines, and there always will be	0
10765	3553	Libraries are one of the best places to find those materials	1
10766	3553	I do not believe that libraries should have to remove those materials from their shelves because maybe some people find them interesting	2
10767	3553	Thats all that libraries like are people interested in reading their books	3
10768	3553	If some people find different books offensive then they shouldn't go near those books	4
10769	3553	If they have a complaint then they should just keep it to themselves and not ruin the chance for others to check them out	5
10770	3553	Libraries shouldn't have to take certain material out of there shelves because some people don't like them, its your choice to read that book, nobody is making you read something that makes you feel uncomfortable	6
10771	3553	Now say if there were a numerous amount of people that take offense to the materials in the library, then the library could decide whether they want to or not, but they still dont need to be told what to do	7
10772	3553	Its their business and they decide what materials stay and which ones go	8
10773	3553	If I was one of those who took offense to a book in the library then i would just keep it to myself	9
10774	3553	I wouldn't like to go through all of that trouble of arguing and complaining just becouse of one book	10
10775	3553	Think of others before you think of yourself sometimes and what their interests are	11
10776	3553	Thats less trouble you will have to go through later on in life.	12
10777	3554	They should not be removed from the shelves	0
10778	3554	If someone finds it offensive they don't have to look at it or check it out	1
10779	3554	If someone finds it offensive then they can ask for that material to be put on the highest shelf their	2
10780	3554	They have a choice on whether they can get it or not	3
10781	3554	Many materials found in a library even if it is offensive can be helpful for someone else	4
10782	3554	The material could have or show some much needed information	5
10783	3554	The people who find it offensive have the right to not look at it	6
10784	3554	Just cause there is some kind of material they find offensive does not mean that everyone does to	7
10785	3554	The people do not need to look at something that they find offensive	8
10786	3554	If there is something offensive about just ask a librarian if they can place that book or movie up higher on the shelves	9
10787	3554	If they find something offensive about the material then they can just not look at	10
10788	3554	Just don't check it out if you find it offensive	11
10789	3554	If they need it out of site you can always put it on the highest shelf	12
10790	3554	There are a lot of offensive material in libraries	13
10791	3554	Even though they are found offensive to someone, someone else could use that material for a paper or project	14
10792	3554	Getting rid of a material can lose someone information about whatever they are researching	15
10793	3554	The books are always the easiest way to get information but not when you are getting rid of them	16
10794	3554	The reason why material from libraries should not be taken away is cause the kids can still find that stuff on the internet	17
10795	3554	If you get rid of those materials you should probably get rid of your internet too	18
10796	3554	No matter how you try to keep your kids away from finding or seeing offensive stuff there is always a way for them to see it	19
10797	3554	So the offensive material should not be taken off shelves in the library because they are needed and children will find out about the offensive stuff when ever they want to	20
10798	3555	If you saw a book on the shelf of your library that took offense to you in some way or another how would you react	0
10799	3555	Would you simply pass the book by and go on searching for another, or would you be so taken by it that you demanded it be removed from the shelves immediately	1
10800	3555	Every school, public library,  movie theatre, magazine stand, and any form of media in this world will do or say one thing or another that someone is not going to like	2
10801	3555	It could be in a magazine in the do and don'ts section and you get slightly offended because you do something that is on the don't list or something about a specific race	3
10802	3555	Everyone, one time in their life, has been accidentally hurt by other peoples words and publishings in the world, but I do not think that is ever going to stop	4
10803	3555	All forms of media are for learning and entertainment purposees	5
10804	3555	These things out there in the world are not for one specific group of people, they are for everyone	6
10805	3555	Every individual person has their own opinion and not everyone else is going to agree with that person	7
10806	3555	Just because one person does not agree with which hairstyle is hot right now doesn't mean that they should take it out of their magazines for all of their viewers	8
10807	3555	To me, that is just ridicolous	9
10808	3555	So, say you stumbled across a book about the @ORGANIZATION1 in the library and you are a person from negro descent	10
10809	3555	Would you get offended	11
10810	3555	Or, say you were watching a show that was talking about slavery a hundred years ago, would that anger you	12
10811	3555	If I were a person of negro descent it wouldn't make me mad at all, because it is just history, history that happened a long time ago that does not pertain to me	13
10812	3555	We could not toss those books out anyways because without those history books at school we couldn't learn about our history	14
10813	3555	History is important to everyone and if we didn't learn about it and they did toss those books out how would we prevent history from repeating itself	15
10814	3555	When I was a young child my father used to hit my mother, so my mother takes offense to anything in the media that has to deal with abuse	16
10815	3555	I tried to have my mother watch a movie with me called '@CAPS1'	17
10816	3555	The movie is about a girl who is abused by her mother and has her father's babies and she finally gets out of it and betters her and her childrens lives	18
10817	3555	My mom said that she couldn't watch it with me because, 'it hit too close to home.'      Everyone is going to become offended in their life by the media	19
10818	3555	The media does not look at you as a whole, just as a population of people	20
10819	3555	When one person doesn't like something it doesn't mean it should be taken out or erased from history, it should just be rewritten or refilmed	21
10820	3555	You cannot control what everyone else says or does in books or movies, you have to just be in control of how you look upon it as	22
10821	3555	That is what I choose to do and I would say it is working out great.	23
10822	3557	What do I think about library censorship	0
10823	3557	I believe that there should be some censorship, but not too much censorship	1
10824	3557	Each person has their own interests and should be able to find something in their library to suit their interest	2
10825	3557	Certain materials are too strong to be put in libraries	3
10826	3557	There are stores that could provide you with that material for you to purchase	4
10827	3557	Most parents wouldn't like their child to be exposed to these certain materials, so they believe that the libraries shouldn't provide these types of materials	5
10828	3557	Now there are some materials that are pushing the line of their content	6
10829	3557	They are strong, but not too strong to not be put in libraries	7
10830	3557	Some people enjoy these strong materials and should be able to find them in their libraries for their pleasure	8
10831	3557	Just because someone doesn't enjoy this material that the library has provided, doesn't mean that the material should be taken away	9
10832	3557	If that was how things worked there would be nothing in the library for people to enjoy	10
10833	3557	Every person has their own taste in materials, be it more mature materials or a little more 'tame' materials	11
10834	3557	Everyone is inclined to their opinions, but their opinion doesn't decide what is and isn't in their library	12
10835	3557	I myself enjoy a wide choice of materials from libraries	13
10836	3557	Some strong materials, some more 'tame' materials	14
10837	3557	It all depends on the persons own interests and choices	15
10838	3557	Sometimes I @MONTH1 be disapointed when I'm looking for something in a library and it's not there, because to some people it's too strong but to me and others it's just a good source of harmless entertainment	16
10839	3557	In conclusion I think that there should be some censorship in libraries, but not too much censorship that people can't find things that interest them	17
10840	3557	Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and has their own form of entertainment, but their libraries shouldn't be built on an indivdual's opinions.	18
10841	3558	Do you think books, music, movies or anything else that could have something offensive be removed from the shelves from our libraries	0
10842	3558	Well this is what im going to talk about in my essay	1
10843	3558	I do not think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves	2
10844	3558	The reason is, is because just because you don't like something that one book might have in it dosen't mean that another person won't	3
10845	3558	Also, some book that have offensive things in them can help you realize the consequenses that could happen of it could reinform you about those kind of things	4
10846	3558	Also if you think the reading material is going to be something you wouldn't read or you think is not appropriate then just don't read it, it saves it so when someone else that actually wants to read something like that then let them	5
10847	3558	Sometimes i will go to the library to find a book that i saw somewhere in a different store and they wouldn't have it, so i would ask about it and they said that if they didn't have it there then it must something in it that could be offensive to others	6
10848	3558	But i know that alot of people like those nasty gross books and some don't	7
10849	3558	People have different opinons about things, so just because the person that is aloud to take the books of the shelve or put them on don't like the book or thinks its not appropriate dosn't mean that someone else will not like it either	8
10850	3558	Well, here is what i think of certain books or anything else that contains reading that are being taking off the shelves	9
10851	3558	I hope it makes people realize that they do like other things than you so leave the offensive readings out so people can learn that if they don't like it then don't read it	10
10852	3560	Do I think offensive reading materials should be taken off the shelves in libraries	0
10853	3560	No, books should not be taken out of libraries	1
10854	3560	If students go to school and they are in high school they pretty much already know what is going on around the world	2
10855	3560	Teens do talk about their lives so pretty much @CAPS1	3
10856	3560	High and @CAPS2 students are going to hear	4
10857	3560	If the parents are sending their child to school and they don't want them to hear about it then don't send them to school	5
10858	3560	In school they will hear verbal arguments and see fights	6
10859	3560	If the parents don't want them to hear about it from other kids than they tell them, they explain it to them	7
10860	3560	One way or another they will find out	8
10861	3560	It can come from the parents, their friends, teachers anybody	9
10862	3560	Teens do not care if your child is watching when they are fighting	10
10863	3560	they are not worried about that at that time	11
10864	3560	The saying 'one person ruins it all for everybody,' well thats because some teens need to grow up and act their age	12
10865	3560	If you can't act your age than you shouldn't be in the grade you are in	13
10866	3560	Kids and teens need to grow up if they can't read a book without being inmature about it than don't read it	14
10867	3560	If their parents let them watch movies that they think they are old enough to watch than don't take advantage of that	15
10868	3560	Taking books out of the libraries will not change anything	16
10869	3560	Kids will still fight and rough house	17
10870	3560	Yeah some books are a little outragous, but not all books	18
10871	3560	To be honest libraries should have sections of books depending on the age or grade they are in	19
10872	3560	High schoolers should be able to control reading about sex, drugs, or drinking	20
10873	3560	If they are not responsible to read that than they shouldn't get that book anyway	21
10874	3560	Songs made today can get a little out of hand	22
10875	3560	If your child listens to that kind of music with all the bad words, talking about sex, drugs, alchol	23
10876	3560	Than parents all you got to do is take those songs away	24
10877	3560	Teens that are mature shouldn't get punished just because inmature can't watch a movie, listen to sond, read a book or a magazine	25
10878	3560	It's not fair to those people	26
10879	3560	People that act their age should be able to read, watch the movie, or anything just because they can handle the situation better	27
10880	3560	So don't punish everybody just because of some inmature kids that ruin it for everybody	28
10881	3561	Im writing to reflect my views on censorship in libraries	0
10882	3561	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	1
10883	3561	I don't believe they should be removed because everyone has their own personal opinion on what's acceptable or not	2
10884	3561	Just because one person doesn't like something or feel that it's offensive doesn't mean that everyone is going to feel that way	3
10885	3561	What one person might not like the next person might love	4
10886	3561	They only way that I feel a certain material should be removed from the shelf is that if there are many complaints about the same material	5
10887	3561	Then maybe the library should consider removing the item	6
10888	3561	Thats why they have ratings and different sections in the library so that a person can know what kind of book they're going to read or what kind of movie they're going to watch	7
10889	3561	It makes no sense to go get a book or movie about something that you don't like or that you think is offensive, its many things to choose from	8
10890	3561	How would someone feel if one of their favorite books or movies were being removed from the shelves of libraries because of another person didn't like it	9
10891	3561	They would be upset and disappointed about situation	10
10892	3561	In conclusion, I disagree with the fact that certain materials should get removed off shelves if felt to be offense	11
10893	3561	I hope that you will understand my point of view and take consideration of my thoughts	12
10894	3562	'hey', I believe that certain materials, such as book, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
10895	3562	First, I know that people have different views appon things such as magazines, books, and music	1
10896	3562	And I also know that there are somethings that @MONTH1 be offensive to you, but they aren't offensive to other perople	2
10897	3562	Such as music there are all kinds of music out there	3
10898	3562	And I know that some people find rap music offensive and some doesnt	4
10899	3562	Because A lot of people that doesn't find it offensive relates to it	5
10900	3562	Second, I feel that if the people that find it offensive would just ignore it then it wouldn't be a problem	6
10901	3562	Because I know that maybe there is a type of magazine, book, or even a type a music that they listen to is offensive to someone else they might not find it offensive but I bet someone else finds it offensive	7
10902	3562	So for them to judge these things wouldn't be right	8
10903	3562	Third, I'm pretty sure that if something in the library was too offensive the library wouldn't have it	9
10904	3562	But maybe if we would take the time out and worry about our self instead of worrying about what's offensive and what's not then the world might be a better place	10
10905	3562	And yes i understand that people have different views but we shouldn't let that get to us	11
10906	3562	So you can see, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	12
10907	3562	Because there are billions of people on this earth and I doubt they would all give you the same answer	13
10908	3562	Because So many people have different opinions, and beliefs appon things.	14
10909	3563	According to Katherine Paterson, who wrote an article about censorship in the library	0
10910	3563	Should we beable to have the right to take a book, magazine, movie etc	1
10911	3563	off the shelf freely	2
10912	3563	Whether if we're offend by it or not	3
10913	3563	I believe we should not have that right to pull thing off of shelves freely	4
10914	3563	If we had that right it would cause problems from many stand points if you think about it	5
10915	3563	One problem it could cause is people thoughts towards a book, movie, cd and so forth	6
10916	3563	If one person looks at and is like 'I don't like this and this about it.' and then just pulls it of the shelf, then thats one less things for somebody who does like it	7
10917	3563	Now since that person doesn't like what the material offers to the public, doesn't mean somebody else dosen't	8
10918	3563	Nobody in this entire world is exactly the same	9
10919	3563	Every body in this world has their likes and dislikes	10
10920	3563	If they had the freedom to take things, then there would be nothing for anybody to read, listen too, watch, eat etc	11
10921	3563	You also have to think how would that affect the business of stores, libraries, and other businesses	12
10922	3563	If everybody is pulling everything off shelves, what would there be to sell or read	13
10923	3563	If a business is not making any money, then they're going to have to be closed down	14
10924	3563	Ecspecially in today economy no business wants to run low on money	15
10925	3563	In Katherine's article at the end she said 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' That is basicly reiterating what I said earlier about peoples likes and dislikes about everything	16
10926	3563	If you don't want your kids or anybody else kids looking at something you believe is offensive	17
10927	3563	You should take it up with one of the workers so they can move it to a different section	18
10928	3563	Like a section for older kids and people	19
10929	3563	Mainly it falls on parents on what content you want your kids looking at	20
10930	3563	You're the ones to raise them the way you want to raise	21
10931	3563	If you think they are to young for something then thats when you tell them no or whatever	22
10932	3563	We should not have the right to take anything off of a shelf	23
10933	3563	Books, movies, music and etc	24
10934	3563	are for entertainment	25
10935	3563	If it doesn't entertain you does not mean it does not for anybody else	26
10936	3564	There are a ton of books out in the world that have a deep meaning and a sense of compasion	0
10937	3564	But, other books can have mean or hateful affects on the person who is reading it	1
10938	3564	Censorship, taking books, movies, magazine, etc	2
10939	3564	off the shelves so a person cannot read or watch them, is a very positive thing	3
10940	3564	In many cases censorship is a great thing	4
10941	3564	It protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a young age	5
10942	3564	In libraires, the librarian should censor the books for younger people so they do not read the awful and hurtful things the book is saying	6
10943	3564	Like books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored, too	7
10944	3564	Some music has a very catchy beat to it and could get stuck in a young persons head	8
10945	3564	This @MONTH1 cause an effect on that child and they @MONTH1 start to act like that or want to become like the person the song is describing	9
10946	3564	Movies should also be censored	10
10947	3564	When I was little, my parents did a good job of censoring things that were bad for me to watch at that age	11
10948	3564	I barly had any nightmares because I was never exposed to that kind of writing when I was a child	12
10949	3564	On the other hand, my friend's parents were not the best at censorship and allowed her to watch or read whatever she wanted	13
10950	3564	She had many of nightmares from the movies or books that she read	14
10951	3564	Now since I am older my parents are starting to let me watch and read more censored things	15
10952	3564	In my experiences with this type of material, I have had some nightmares and have personly been offened by some books	16
10953	3564	Although, censored books @MONTH1 have a great story behind them, the material that supports it can cause a dispute between different people who have different beliefs	17
10954	3564	Thousands of books are censored each year	18
10955	3564	Many of them have to do with different religions or races that people  have different opinions on	19
10956	3564	Libraries need to censor books to protect the iniscent minds of young childern	20
10957	3565	'@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1'          @CAPS1  people have @CAPS1 types of genres of books, music, movies, etc., that they like as well as @CAPS1 they don't like	0
10958	3565	Meaning that its up to you what you like and you are @ORGANIZATION1 forces to read or listen to anything you don't want to	1
10959	3565	Books, music, and other entertaining things are here as an @ORGANIZATION1 so if you dont like it then you don't have to deal with it	2
10960	3565	I feel that it is @ORGANIZATION1 neccessary that books should be removed from the shelves  just because someone has gotten offended @ORGANIZATION1 it	3
10961	3565	You were @ORGANIZATION1 told that it is a must to read that book and it wasn't the company nor the author's fault that you rented the book and you felt insulted	4
10962	3565	Most likely there were @ORGANIZATION1 directing the story towards you so why get all worked up over something that has happen to you and take it out on the media	5
10963	3565	You chose it @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1	6
10964	3565	Why make the company lose investment over something that could be easily taken care of @ORGANIZATION1 simply taking it back where you got it from	7
10965	3565	I have read @CAPS1 books, listened to @CAPS1 songs, and seen lots of movies that weren't in my best interest but I didn't make them stop saling them because i'm pretty sure someone out there likes it	8
10966	3565	Why stop someone elses enjoyment because of my uninterest	9
10967	3565	It's really @ORGANIZATION1 that neccesary	10
10968	3565	And that's the problem in the world today, people take little situations into a big catastraphy for no reason	11
10969	3565	If you don't like it then don't get it	12
10970	3565	People need to put their feet in the company's shoes and realize that if it was them, they would understand	13
10971	3565	Books, magazines, music, movies, etc., are made for everyone in the world to make entertainment for those who are interested	14
10972	3565	Taking them off the shelves would be more than unnessecary just because some person doesn't like it	15
10973	3565	People have different opinions about life and that's what makes every indiviual different from one another	16
10974	3565	So why ruin other people's fun just to get what you want	17
10975	3565	As I stated before for it is @ORGANIZATION1 neccessary to remove an item from the shelves because someone has taken offense to something	18
10976	3565	It's @ORGANIZATION1 the company's fault so just simply don't buy it or take it back	19
10977	3565	Things would be so much better	20
10978	3565	Get the items that best fits you and leave the others that don't on the shelves.	21
10979	3566	Should offensive or graphic books be removed from the libary	0
10980	3566	Well,in my point of view I think books, music, movies, magazines, etc.	1
10981	3566	are amazing, exciting and fun to read or watch they should not be removed from the shelves in the local libary	2
10982	3566	For a fact people in general have many types of tastes in books thier's drama, romance, action and many other that also apply to movies, magazines and etc	3
10983	3566	The public should not be punished for one's intreast in themes, and how they take the book	4
10984	3566	Thier should be an age limit in witch kids can't read certain books and those of age should read whatever they please	5
10985	3566	I, myself  like to read scary books, they give me chills and all types of questions runing through my brain	6
10986	3566	Someone else from my community could have the same trait of thought I have when reading a scary book	7
10987	3566	Without books that don't fit are personality thier would be less people in libaries reading and more people trying to keep themseleves occupied and half of them might even get bored and start commiting crimes, to keep there self  occupied	8
10988	3566	People in the community have rights to read, hear or watch witch ever type of material they like	9
10989	3566	If people really do have a hard time with some of the material that is on display, they should not even pick it up to begin with	10
10990	3566	They should look for stuff they would enjoy, not just because the book is about 'violence' or just simply don't like the theme they, should not hold it against other people that might enjoy it	11
10991	3566	Books and other material were meant for us to enjoy them and from the authors or directores choice to share with us thier stories	12
10992	3566	Without books like those many people can't get ideas to help them creat thier own book or novel	13
10993	3566	So that is my view on the situation, people should enjoy whatever material they like	14
10994	3566	But, if you are one of those people that think books, movies, magazienes should be removed, take a day and read a book or see a movie from your local libary and see how it will change your mind	15
10995	3567	There are many types of reading materials for people to read in a library	0
10996	3567	You can find things on cars, trucks, sports, and made up stories for fun	1
10997	3567	There are some materials in a library though that could be offensive	2
10998	3567	But should those materials be removed from the library	3
10999	3567	Some think that they should and others think that they shouldn't be	4
11000	3567	In my opinion I don't think that things should be removed from a library	5
11001	3567	Certain people @MONTH1 find things offensive and others @MONTH1 think it is perfectly fine to have in a library	6
11002	3567	I think there should be certain areas and age limits for certain materials a person could find in  library	7
11003	3567	I think that there should be age limits for certain types of reading material	8
11004	3567	People don't want a little child to read something that is meant to be for an adult	9
11005	3567	That would teach kids bad things that they don't need to be reading about	10
11006	3567	I think that there should be an area set for kids that are in elementary to high school and there should be a section that is for adults	11
11007	3567	That way kids aren't reading things that are meant for adults	12
11008	3567	I also think that are there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about	13
11009	3567	Like if there are books on slavery they should have an area for books that are about that that way people who are offended be it know to stay away from it	14
11010	3567	The same with magazines	15
11011	3567	i don't think they should be removed from a library if they are found offensive to some people because other people @MONTH1 enjoy reading them	16
11012	3567	Some reading material @MONTH1 be found offensive to certain people but to othersit @MONTH1 not be	17
11013	3567	I think things shouldn't be removed from libraries	18
11014	3567	There are some things that people @MONTH1 need have in a library if they are doing a project that way they have the resources to do it	19
11015	3567	I do think that certain movies and music should be removed from shelves if little kids are aloud in the store	20
11016	3567	kids don't nedd to be watching adult movies while they are in elementary school	21
11017	3567	That just isn't right	22
11018	3567	Espaecially if the movie is promoting sex, violence, and other things that young kids should not be doing	23
11019	3567	So in my opinion there are some things that should and should not be removed from a library	24
11020	3567	Music and movies that promote things that young children should not be doing	25
11021	3567	Magazines and other things should be kept away to where only adults could get to them	26
11022	3568	I do not believe that censorship should be an option for people that find a book, magazine, or movie offensive	0
11023	3568	I believe that if a person decides to take a book off the shelf because he/she is offended, they are obviously paranoid	1
11024	3568	If a few cuss words are found in a book and a person doesn't want their children to read that book, then don't allow them to get it	2
11025	3568	Don't make all of the other people suffer	3
11026	3568	Censorship is an unnecessary solution to something that isn't even a problem	4
11027	3568	You know what they say, 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.'      @CAPS1 of all, people have a variety of opinions	5
11028	3568	Some people think that violence is ok and some people don't think it's ok	6
11029	3568	If one person decides to put a book off the shelf because they find it offensive, what will the next person think	7
11030	3568	They @MONTH1 find violence perfectly acceptable and they might allow their kids to read the book	8
11031	3568	Then it would create a big conflict	9
11032	3568	Lastly, parents need to allow their kids to grow up and mature	10
11033	3568	They also need their kids to know the difference between right and wrong	11
11034	3568	If they don't read books or movies with violence or cuss words when they're young, what will they do when they discover it when they're older	12
11035	3568	As a child, it is a time to learn life lessons and begin to form clear distinctions between right and wrong	13
11036	3568	Shielding your children from it will only hinder their progress in figuring things out and learning to think for themselves as adults	14
11037	3568	Censorship is the same thing that @PERSON1 did to prevent people to think for themselves and discover that his tactics were a great evil to society	15
11038	3568	In other words, censorship is part of fascism and should not even be considered in @CAPS2 society	16
11039	3568	The citizens of @LOCATION1 have the responsibility of exposing the truth and teaching our children the differences between right and wrong	17
11040	3568	It's one of the ideals that help make this country great	18
11041	3569	Censorship	0
11042	3569	Sometimes it's needed, sometimes it's not	1
11043	3569	Children of today are exposed to many adult things, whether it is watching tv or a movie, or just witnessing things at home	2
11044	3569	I believe censorship is neccesary for young children, they shouldn't be exposed to bad launguage, or graphic scenes, or something that is strictly for adults	3
11045	3569	They will experience these things one day, and they need to be mature enough to understand them	4
11046	3569	Teenagers on the other hand is a whole different story	5
11047	3569	They want to hear the bad language and see graphic, gory scenes	6
11048	3569	It's all about action to the boys, drama for the girls, and everyone wants to hear those juicy details	7
11049	3569	Censorship won't stop them from moving on to the next movie or book on the shelf that has all these things in them	8
11050	3569	Even though all teens act like it's not important and that their old enough to see all this, somethimes their probably not	9
11051	3569	If you think that telling your teenage daughter or son that their not allowed to watch a movie or read a book because of something it says, they'll probably just go log onto the internet and see it anyway	10
11052	3569	Nothing is censored on the internet, so if your all about censorship, don't go onto to the internet.Adults do not need censorship	11
11053	3569	There adults, they can make their own decisions and they know what they want to watch or read.Removing things from the shelves of libraries is sometimes needed	12
11054	3569	There should be sections, children, teens, and adults	13
11055	3569	There are ratings on movies, and books are written for a certain age limit so everything should be placed accordingly	14
11056	3569	Censorship is needed, but your parents or guardian are the ones who will most likely tell you whether or not your going to be able to read a book or a watch a movie	15
11057	3569	Some people find things more offensive than others	16
11058	3569	So censorship is really in the eye of the beholder	17
11059	3569	Personally I believe in censorship, but to others, its a waste of time	18
11060	3569	I wouldn't want my child watching a movie where someone gets brudally murdered and where there cussing every other word	19
11061	3569	Music can come uncensored and censored, it just depends what you want to hear	20
11062	3569	Censorship is either loved or hated, its all one big opinion.	21
11063	3570	Each book in a library bears its own relation to each person that enters that library	0
11064	3570	Whether the books relate well or poorly to each person is not something for a mass of people to decide	1
11065	3570	Every person has a different outlook on what makes a story interesting	2
11066	3570	There will not ever be a book that every human being agrees to be both appropriate and vivacious	3
11067	3570	Designed with distinctly different minds, people want to read distinctly different books, written by distinctly different authors	4
11068	3570	People should maintain a right to choose which books he or she @MONTH1 want to read	5
11069	3570	Never, will one book bind the world	6
11070	3570	Minds of human beings are too complexly separated	7
11071	3570	For example	8
11072	3570	reading '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' by @PERSON2 in my @CAPS3 class last year was more than appropriate, though rather boring for the majority of the class	9
11073	3570	Books of racism, religion, and sexual content intrigue a person's mind, or otherwise disgust one's	10
11074	3570	Finding satisfactory books for everyone in a community to agree simply will not ever be done	11
11075	3570	There will always be that one person who declines to agree	12
11076	3570	It is a choice	13
11077	3570	It is a choice for each person to read what he or she wants to read	14
11078	3570	If you force something upon a society of readers, then what will they have left for their own minds' freedom	15
11079	3570	Face it, forcing an atheist to read an emotionally comprehensive novel of the @CAPS4 faith will not be stood for by the reader	16
11080	3570	Cursing, to some people, brings a book to a realistic point	17
11081	3570	To others, however, it draws them further and further away from the story	18
11082	3570	A choice should remain a person's right	19
11083	3570	especially to read a book written to be read	20
11084	3570	Finding an appropriate book is not the problem	21
11085	3570	That has yet to become the problem	22
11086	3570	The only problem is finding appropriate books that are both compelling and enthralling	23
11087	3570	I find '@CAPS5 in the @CAPS6' to be dangerously inappropriate	24
11088	3570	However, it captivates my mind beyond other dimensions	25
11089	3570	Others that I know choose not to read it because of the offensive content	26
11090	3570	Do I find it offensive to some	27
11091	3570	No, but I understand where others could find it offensive	28
11092	3570	There is no way to approve a book to not be offensive, because it is not offensive to every person who reads it	29
11093	3570	To reiterate, the mind of human is a unique one, that identifies with no other	30
11094	3570	To sum up the full idea of this position	31
11095	3570	every person should be given the choice to read what he or she desires	32
11096	3570	Give each person the choice, and the rebellion will settle down	33
11097	3570	Removing a book from a shelf just puts the craving in the hearts of certain people to read it	34
11098	3570	sometimes completely rebelliously	35
11099	3570	Katherine Paterson is extremely correct by saying that taking a book from a shelf everytime someone wants one banned will not leave books for anyone	36
11100	3570	As a person, I am well associated with my mind, and it desires the freedom of choice	37
11101	3570	Every human mind desires the freedom to choose	38
11102	3570	Give people the choice	39
11103	3570	Remove no books from a shelf, and let the outcome draw in whoever is interested in whatever they @MONTH1 be interested in	40
11104	3570	Let readers have their freedom.	41
11105	3571	In society today, people take things in very many different ways	0
11106	3571	So things that might help one person, @MONTH1 offend other	1
11107	3571	In libraries, there are different kinds of books	2
11108	3571	fiction, non fiction..(etc)	3
11109	3571	So if you dont like a particular book, maybe you should try looking in a different area	4
11110	3571	I do not think books should be removed from the shelf because the book has offened a few people	5
11111	3571	We are blessed to live in @LOCATION1, where we have freedom of speech	6
11112	3571	So authors have freedom to write what they would like to	7
11113	3571	They work long hard hours getting a book ready to be published and then someone wants to take it off the shelf becasue it offened a few people	8
11114	3571	I do not think that is right	9
11115	3571	'@CAPS1 man's junk is another man's treasure.' I think this quote goes along with this topic very well, because the book @MONTH1 not mean something to one person but it @MONTH1 mean the word to someone else	10
11116	3571	You never know what people @MONTH1 need to hear	11
11117	3571	Maybe an alcoholic is at a point in his/her life and is ready to change, and someone has a book about a recovering alcoholic	12
11118	3571	Now, this kind of book @MONTH1 offend a few people, but it @MONTH1 save a family, a friendship or maybe even a life	13
11119	3571	Take @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for intance, her journal is now a book	14
11120	3571	Now this @MONTH1 offend a few people that might have been thereor maybe don't like @CAPS4 @CAPS5, but her story has the right to be told	15
11121	3571	Yes, there is violence in it, and i understand that maybe you don't want your @NUM1 year old to hear about how they use to treat @CAPS4 @CAPS7 women, but the story has the right to be told, and should be told	16
11122	3571	I do not think that the librarian has the right to take a book off the shelf at the library, just because it has offened a few	17
11123	3571	There are lots of different kinds of books, if the books you are reading offend you, look for a different type of book	18
11124	3573	In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes	0
11125	3573	Items should not be removed from the shelves just because someone takes offense to it	1
11126	3573	Everyone has a book or movie out there that they disagree with, but if it is removed just for that reason then there would be a very limited selection left	2
11127	3573	Students would take advantage of this and they would have educational books removed	3
11128	3573	Removing items from shelves removes history	4
11129	3573	Our history books tell us stories of slavery and descrimination	5
11130	3573	If someone takes offense to this and has it removed then we are losing a part of our history that needs to be heard and taught so that it does not occur again	6
11131	3573	Items in the library are items that you can choose to check out or choose to not check out	7
11132	3573	If you take offense to an item in the library then you do not have to read it	8
11133	3573	Something that you @MONTH1 take as offensive @MONTH1 be something that inspires and encourages someone else	9
11134	3573	Wether you like an item or dislike it is a matter of your own personal opinion and decisions should not be made based on someones opinion alone	10
11135	3573	Think about it	11
11136	3573	If you have a favorite book, movie, or song then would you want it to be gotten rid of based on someones opinion	12
11137	3573	You have the right to be able to read,watch, or listen to whatever you want	13
11138	3573	It should not be limited based on someone elses opinion	14
11139	3573	It would cause much argument among people	15
11140	3573	Some have different opinions then others on a certain item in the library which will lead to argument and possible violence	16
11141	3573	There are so many wonderful and inspiring books and movies out there and there is always going to be someone who does not like at least one of them	17
11142	3573	If items are removed based on someones opinion then there will be a very limited selection left	18
11143	3573	People read for enjoyment and knowledge	19
11144	3573	They deserve to have a wide selction to choose from	20
11145	3573	In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes	21
11146	3573	Our opinions should not be based on a person's dislike of something	22
11147	3573	If they take offense to it then they have the right to ignore it	23
11148	3573	There are so many books and movies out there that teach us of life before our generation	24
11149	3573	We need these books and movies so that there are not repeat events of all of the rough times our ancestors had to go through	25
11150	3573	We need these books for future generations so that we are able to teach and guide them	26
11151	3573	Items should not be removed from the shelves based on the fact that someone takes offense to it.	27
11152	3574	Practice @CAPS1 You @CAPS2     The @LOCATION1 is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country	0
11153	3574	In the @DATE1's people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland	1
11154	3574	In @LOCATION2 we practice freedom of speech	2
11155	3574	If we censor materials like books, music, movies, etc	3
11156	3574	it would defeat the entire purpose of @LOCATION2 and it's @ORGANIZATION1	4
11157	3574	Everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes	5
11158	3574	Not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject, thats why its wonderful that their is a variety of everything	6
11159	3574	If you start banning or censoring certain things then how will people learn	7
11160	3574	There is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know @CAPS1 or @CAPS1 not to do if in that situation	8
11161	3574	When you censor 'bad things' it creates naive thinkers, which only leads to discrimination	9
11162	3574	I agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents @MONTH1 find offensive	10
11163	3574	For example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same	11
11164	3574	Of course its up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations but banning something all together is not neccessary	12
11165	3574	I personally learned a lot of things from @CAPS1 I've seen on television	13
11166	3574	Whats on television @MONTH1 be considered 'street smart' education but that is good	14
11167	3574	Today we live in a scary and violent society, so being 'street smart' is an advantage	15
11168	3574	If television was censored then people would not know @CAPS1 to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before	16
11169	3574	If books, movies, magazines, music, etc	17
11170	3574	are removed from shelves then @LOCATION2 is not practicing @CAPS1 it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom.	18
11171	3575	Censorhship should play a major part in which books should enter and leave the library	0
11172	3575	Thats why I think that if a book, movie, magazine, or cd should deffinitly should be removed from the shelf if it is found offensive to atleast ten children	1
11173	3575	Now it would be asking too much to have the libraian read through all the books to make sure there is no bad language or anything else that a parent might not want their child to read about	2
11174	3575	So therefore a library should have a certain section that if a libraian thinks that there might be some bad language or refrence to drugs or alcohol then that book should go into that part of the library	3
11175	3575	I have found some books that have some pretty graphic material in them that I dont think a little kid should be reading but there was nothing I could do about it except take it up to the libraian	4
11176	3575	Movies would be a major thing that they would have to watch out for	5
11177	3575	Just because the movie has a title that dont seem that bad dont mean that there wont be any grapic images in that movie, or that there wont be any inappropriate language used at one point in the movie	6
11178	3575	Now since movies are alot easier to review and since they also have a rating then that should make it easier to tell if that movie should go on the shelves of a library or not	7
11179	3575	But there should deffinitly be a part in the library that if they did want to allow certain movies in there that would be inappropriate for little children then those movies should be put in that part of the library that has a door on it so the kids would know not to go in that room	8
11180	3575	Music would be another thing you would deffinitly have to watch out for because with each song could change how the languge is in that cd	9
11181	3575	So I think that the librarian should have to sit down and persoanlly listen to that cd before they decide to put it out on the shelves for others to be able to listen to	10
11182	3575	But personally i think that there should be no music allowed in libraries just because with every new cd album that an artist makes he could easily change how his wording is in the songs	11
11183	3575	So you just never know what the artist of the song is going to do with his music	12
11184	3575	One album can be perfectly fine and not have one cuss word on it, but then the next album that he or she makes could just be loaded with cuss words	13
11185	3575	Another possible way to prevent little kids from hearing or reading about inappropriate stuff is to have some of the books, magazines, cd's, or movies catagorized by age	14
11186	3575	As a child gets older he will be tought more about certain things	15
11187	3575	Then once he picks up that book and sees that its mentioned in the book it wont be that big of a shock to him or his parents	16
11188	3575	With the way things are today its almost impossible for a kid to pick something up and not read about drugs or violence	17
11189	3575	So if you were to go through and take everything off the shelf that mentioned drugs or violence then there would be nothing left on the shelfs for kids to listen to or read	18
11190	3575	Your not going to be able to catch every single movie, book, magazine, or cd that has something to do with violence or alcohol use	19
11191	3575	But you can take some of the stuff that has alot of that kind of stuff in it off the shelf	20
11192	3575	By just taking some of the materials off the shelf that contain stuff that @MONTH1 seem inappropriate for children will deffinitly make a big difference and it could possibly protect your child from reading across it someday when he or she reads a book and sees that or listens to a cd and hears the artist metion something about that	21
11193	3575	Game designers are now starting to make all their games around violene	22
11194	3575	So if you were to take all the games that have violence in them and take them off the shelf there would be no games left for kids to play	23
11195	3575	So there are just some things that contain violence that you just cant keep your child from seeing at one point in time	24
11196	3575	All the games have a rating on them so you should have an adult check that game rating before you let your child get that game	25
11197	3575	By doing that you will be able to somewhat controll what your child will see and it will also make it better because then you are not taking games that other kids might like off the shelf and making them no longer available	26
11198	3575	So I have pretty much covered about how who ever is in charge of the games, books, movies and cds should look them over and possibly listen or look at them just to see what they are like before they put them out on the shelf	27
11199	3575	You dont have to censor everything but there are deffinitly some things out there that should not be put out on the shelfs for little kids to look at or listen to	28
11200	3575	And if a little kid wants to get a game a parent should have to look at the game and the rating of the game to determine if that child is mature enough to handle what goes on in that game	29
11201	3575	But overall I personally dont think that they should just go through and ban everything from going on the shelfs it should be up to the child to determine if they can handle what that movie or book contains	30
11202	3576	Do I believe that some books should be taking off the shelves if they are found offensive 	0
11203	3576	Well what do you think 	1
11204	3576	I think they should depending on cause or what degeree of the party being offended	2
11205	3576	I feel if there are books ,movies,or music that are saying or showing a form of insluts then it depends on who is being offended	3
11206	3576	If you have a racist book against all races like blacks,asian,or mexican etc..	4
11207	3576	other minorities @MONTH1 find out about those forms of insults and they raise an issue about it, then yes take it off the shelves	5
11208	3576	If you have a confrontation about it then it could get violent 	6
11209	3576	Also, if you dont then they could sue you for racism or make it public to everyone that you are a racist library and you would loose business	7
11210	3576	So to avoid all of the fighting and  lawsuits and other humiliation against you and the other minorites	8
11211	3576	If they bring up a situation then just take it off the shelves so you can stay safe and them as well	9
11212	3576	Plus , they only come here for an oppurtunity to start a new life cause usually they're coming from poverty srticken towns, homes countries	10
11213	3576	I myself, am not a racist person I think that we are equal just unique individuals we're all unique in our own ways  that is what makes us who we are today.	11
11214	3577	Many people have many different thoughts and beliefs	0
11215	3577	Some people @MONTH1 believe that a movie or song needs to be removed, but others @MONTH1 disagree, and nobody wants the things they enjoy to be taken away	1
11216	3577	If there was a book on a shelf in a bookstore that you didn't agree with and thought should be removed, and you removed it, then you are taking away from someone who @MONTH1 enjoy that book	2
11217	3577	If everyone removed things from life that they didn't enjoy, then there would be very little to enjoy	3
11218	3577	For example, I personally love horror movies	4
11219	3577	I love the thrill you get from a horror movie and how they can make you jump even though it's just a movie screen	5
11220	3577	I'm sure there are people in this world who think horror movies are wrong	6
11221	3577	If those people were allowed to just remove them forever, I, and many other people, would be sadly dissapointed	7
11222	3577	I also love video games	8
11223	3577	Video games are a huge part of my life, and I know for a fact that there are people who highly disagree with some of the content of them	9
11224	3577	If people could take video games away because they didn't agree with them, i would be crushed	10
11225	3577	I am also aware that people @MONTH1 just be worried about their children watching movies, listening to songs, or reading books that are not appropriate for them	11
11226	3577	I understand that the parents want their children to be supervised, but removing the books, movies and songs is not exactly the answer	12
11227	3577	Movies and books can easily be censored	13
11228	3577	Many movies and songs have language filters and some movie programs now have parental options that allow the parents to decide what movies they want to allow their children to watch	14
11229	3577	Parents can also supervise their children when they download music onto an ipod or phone, and depending on where they are bought, books and magazine's @MONTH1 require parental consent	15
11230	3577	Video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game	16
11231	3577	We can't just go around removing everything we dont like, because it is not fair to those who @MONTH1 like it	17
11232	3577	We live in a world with many different ideas, thoughts and beliefs, and we all need equal right to share them	18
11233	3578	Today in society there are many things people have different views on	0
11234	3578	They can be religion, race, or brought up in a different way	1
11235	3578	Today in libraries there are many books of all types	2
11236	3578	They can relate to all different kinds of people	3
11237	3578	If one book is discriminating against another indivual is this right	4
11238	3578	I think the libraries need to stay the way they are and leave things the way they have had them for different reasons	5
11239	3578	First off, no one is the same, what might be bad to someone else can be good to another person	6
11240	3578	If someone simply doesn't like the context of a book, movie, or even music ect	7
11241	3578	They don't have to read,watch,or listen to it	8
11242	3578	Since no one is the same what someone might not find appealing can be amazing thing to another person	9
11243	3578	Second, this can be there for purpose	10
11244	3578	The @LOCATION2 wasn't always a equal place	11
11245	3578	If there are books that talk about the discrimination on other races I think it's simply showing history	12
11246	3578	If we didn't have history to look back on we wouldn't be able to see how @LOCATION1 has progressed	13
11247	3578	From slave states to all free states	14
11248	3578	I think it is important for material such as that to be left so it can looked on upon	15
11249	3578	Third reason, is a library is suppose to consist of these different things such as books, movies, music ect	16
11250	3578	If we were to take everything out the libraries that comes off offensive it wouldn't be a place were you could find things that you wanted	17
11251	3578	It would probably be a boring place	18
11252	3578	If theres no variety in a library I don't see how it can be called a library	19
11253	3578	You can find whatever your looking for in a library whether its on how to do hair to the hitsory of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2	20
11254	3578	In conslusion, these reason make up why libraries should stay the way they are	21
11255	3578	One is because what might be offensive to a ivdivual might be different to someone else	22
11256	3578	Second, it would take a lot away from history	23
11257	3578	Thrid, it wouldn't make a library what it is today	24
11258	3578	These are ligetament resaons why it should be left alone	25
11259	3579	In our public libraries we can find books that are related to slavery, drugs, gangs, prostitution and violence	0
11260	3579	Theses books all have history in them of our past	1
11261	3579	We cannot, as a society, forget our past because as many historains say, history repeats its self	2
11262	3579	If we start censoring our libraries then all that history will be forgoten, and/or lost	3
11263	3579	Libraries can help us in many different ways	4
11264	3579	They help us with school projects, bussiness projects, and libraries better our knoweldge as a person	5
11265	3579	You cannot go censoring the libraries just because someone finds a book offesive	6
11266	3579	The stories of slavory are still taken offensively amoug people @DATE1, but if we start taking stories about people who have been enslaved and hide them from the poeple, we will slip back into that terrible past	7
11267	3579	There are gang stories of terrifying people, such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2	8
11268	3579	He killed many people, destroyed many shops and probably even sold a lot of drugs	9
11269	3579	We need history to show our weakness as a nation and not hide because of this weakness but thrive on it to better our cities, better our police training, and most importantly, better the next generation of kids to be raised better	10
11270	3579	There is more than just books at the public library, there are movies and documentaries of our nation and the @CAPS3	11
11271	3579	Movies that talk about @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM2	12
11272	3579	These types of movies can show how horrifying @CAPS4 really is and how cruel people can get	13
11273	3579	During @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM2, there was the @CAPS9 where six million jews lost their lives because one person, @PERSON2, did not like them	14
11274	3579	People made movies like those to show the @CAPS3 how devestating man can be but people have made movies on amazing discoveries and amazing places	15
11275	3579	For example @PERSON1	16
11276	3579	One of the greatest findings amoug the @CAPS3	17
11277	3579	Music can also be a good way to better ones self	18
11278	3579	If you play an instrument and you need music to play to, why not go to the library to get some	19
11279	3579	You dont have to worry about payin for a @MONEY1 cd and you can use it until your done with it then return	20
11280	3579	Then with how advanced our technokwledge is, people can get cd's to burn on to a computer and put on their ipod or @NUM4 player	21
11281	3579	Plus the library is a good place to just go look for music you like	22
11282	3579	So, should there be censorship in our libraries	23
11283	3579	NO	24
11284	3579	There should not and the key reason as to why is because it is history	25
11285	3579	History of our country, history of our @CAPS3, and history of sad and hard times	26
11286	3579	Instead of censoring our youth of @DATE1 from history we need to set age limits	27
11287	3579	Young people of a certain age can not read certain books unless they are with a parent or gaurdian	28
11288	3579	That is one simple way to keep our kids from readin to mature thing but still able to get the history he/she needs because as historains always say, history repeats its self and as a growing nation, we need to better ourselves in every way possible	29
11289	3579	The answer to that is through our history.	30
11290	3582	Why censore something that someone worked hard on	0
11291	3582	People put up money and countless amounts of time to write this and yet you want to censore it.See there is honestly no need to censore any thing in the library because there certain sections for certain people therefore this whole conversation shouldnt be going on in the first place.People just like to knit pick about what they can not handle for instense like the word nigger i dont like it at all but i can handle it and therfore i just shut my mouth and suck it up.So I just feel like all the critique and all the imature people just need not to read or dont go to the library but thats only me though.So stop acting like little children the authors want their stuff on shelves and not being banned and raved and ranted about alsoIn conclusion stop being imature and if you dont like it dont read it	1
11292	3582	Always think to yourself about what your doing before you decside	2
11293	3583	I do believe that certain materials such as books, movies,magazines ,etc should be removed from the shelfs if they are found offensive	0
11294	3583	I think offensive books movies music and etc should be removed from shelfs becasue that is basically encouraging young children that if they see something innoproperiate its okay to watch 	1
11295	3583	I would not want my brother or sister to watch, or see anything thing that is not approperiate	2
11296	3583	I remember there was a time I was thirteen years old and my mom and step dad at the time did not agree that I should have @PERSON1,@CAPS1 or @NUM1 on my television, They thought that I was too young to be watching what was on @CAPS2 and it was innoproperiate in their opinion	3
11297	3583	I disagreed with that, I thought I should have the right to have watch it because I liked the shows and they were interesting to watch	4
11298	3583	Everything that was on @CAPS2 was not as bad in my opinion	5
11299	3583	When I would watch music videos on @CAPS1 every song that was being played was the edited version	6
11300	3583	I had to argue and prove a point in why I should have @NUM2, @NUM1 on my @CAPS2	7
11301	3583	Parents all have a different opinion in what is good and what is bad for their children	8
11302	3583	In my case my mom did not want me to watch anything that was bad	9
11303	3583	She knew what it was like when she was young	10
11304	3583	She thought that maybe i would think what i see on @CAPS2 is not a bad thing 	11
11305	3583	I was thinking to myself that oh well i am young and i will eventually learn in the long run from what is good and what is bad	12
11306	3584	TAKING THE @CAPS1 TO @CAPS2      Everyone will read a book in their lifetime at some point in their life	0
11307	3584	The author cannot filter through the entire book to remove offensive language, racial remarks, slurs, etc	1
11308	3584	One offensive to a person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another	2
11309	3584	I strongly disagree that books should be removed if they are found offensive to a specific group, person, or community	3
11310	3584	Most books are organized in categories by maturity and genre	4
11311	3584	The reader should know where he/she stands among these categories, so they will not be offended	5
11312	3584	Maturity comes with understanding	6
11313	3584	Books are sorted by genre	7
11314	3584	Most, to all, times the @CAPS2 takes from the genre	8
11315	3584	The era of when the book takes place is also a key factor	9
11316	3584	When @CAPS2 an author must take this into consideration	10
11317	3584	If the setting of the book was in @NUM1 A.D	11
11318	3584	the author would not want to use grammar from the present day	12
11319	3584	The reader should be prompted on what books they @MONTH1 read before doing so	13
11320	3584	From one reader to another, taking the @CAPS1 on what we read is the real solution	14
11321	3584	Maturity comes with understanding	15
11322	3584	If the reader is mature enough to understand the @CAPS2 then the book corresponds with the age of that child	16
11323	3584	This is why I strongly agree that books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive to one person, group, or community	17
11324	3585	Should we take off books that are offensive	0
11325	3585	I think that we should not take them out if they are offensive	1
11326	3585	If we do take off the offensive stuff off the self then there are not any more on the self	2
11327	3585	If all of us could take off the book, movie, or music that in fensive to us then there will be no books, movies, or music on the self	3
11328	3585	First off all, there will be no war books, movies, or music on the self	4
11329	3585	All the hippys will take the war stuff off because they dont like war	5
11330	3585	They will say that it infensive on them on take them off	6
11331	3585	I think that we should read about war and witch them because it is a good way to learn our mistake	7
11332	3585	If we don't learn the mistake of war we will lose and we wont learn how we loss and we will go into war over and over again we will win some and lose alot because we wont learn how we lost	8
11333	3585	Secondly, all the music that are good and bad will be taken off the self	9
11334	3585	All the mothers that are to protactive they will take them done	10
11335	3585	It have bad language in it and a bad theme to it	11
11336	3585	If they take them down how can the football players, solders, and fighters can be ready for the fight if they don't have the songs that they like to listen to and get pump for the fight	12
11337	3585	Finally, they will take out all thethe books of star wars and forgetten ralms	13
11338	3585	Some people don't like them because they think that it wont come true and they will take them out and say that it infensives them on there thinking wise	14
11339	3585	Star wars is a good book and movie and forgetten ralms is a good book maker company	15
11340	3585	All of this is why i don't want this to happen	16
11341	3585	All the good music, books, and movies well go away and the people who like them well get mad.	17
11342	3586	Everyone person can think of something that we did not like or want to see	0
11343	3586	If you were offended by that one thing, do you think you should have the right to have it taken away or banned	1
11344	3586	Or what if you liked the choice of what the place had, but someone else didn't	2
11345	3586	Should they have the right to take it away just because they don't approve	3
11346	3586	What if @NUM1 people came into a library with  @NUM2 books, magazines, music and movies, and @NUM3 of them did not like any part of the library and wanted every book, magazine, music, and movie taken out	4
11347	3586	Even if the @NUM4 others loved what they saw	5
11348	3586	Do you think it's fair just because some people do not approve, that they get to pick	6
11349	3586	I do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that	7
11350	3586	If something is that offensive to that many people, they should be mature enough to ignore what they see and find what they like	8
11351	3586	If someone did not like your house and said I don't want to see it should they have to demolish it just like nothing	9
11352	3586	The world would have never ending chaos if people had too much power to change things	10
11353	3586	It could only get worse	11
11354	3586	I have encountered problems between people that do not agree on throwing out or keeping it	12
11355	3586	One solution could be just move it to a different area where if certain people would like to look at the item they could, otherwise have  separate parts of a room that are divided into all ranges	13
11356	3586	If you read this and think to yourself about how many different options you have to get along and not have to worry about offending people you will realize that no certain person should be able to take that one thing that you would like to keep to enjoy and be happy.	14
11357	3589	Censorship is a growing problem is today's world of literature	0
11358	3589	Censoring does not always allow the author to thoroughly convey his or her ideas as they were originally intended to	1
11359	3589	Katherine Paterson says that if were all aloud to eliminate things that we thought were wrong, then there would be nothing left to be right about	2
11360	3589	Censoring leads to an ignorant, opinionless, and clueless society	3
11361	3589	In the novel '@CAPS1 @NUM1' censorship is one of the main themes of the story	4
11362	3589	Bradbury portrays the burning of books as the way of ending all controversial opinions	5
11363	3589	@PERSON3 finds that the burning of books has lead the society that he lives in to be ignorant of what is going on around them	6
11364	3589	The government has tried to rule out all causes of controversial opinions in hope that it would make for a happier society	7
11365	3589	When in reality, members of the world are not happy and are consistently showing the reader that they do not know how to be happy	8
11366	3589	@PERSON3 decides that he wants to learn, but he does not know how	9
11367	3589	The brain is a muscle, if it is not excercised correctly, it becomes weak and useless	10
11368	3589	So when he tries to memorize a part of the @CAPS2, he cannot retain what he has been reading	11
11369	3589	Such as trying to fill a sieve full of sand, he does not know how to learn	12
11370	3589	The members of this novels society are basically opinionless on what is happening in their world	13
11371	3589	What they are told on the television is thought of to be factual, and that is what they do all day	14
11372	3589	In school, kids are being fed fact after fact and are expected to agree with what they are being told with no questioning involved	15
11373	3589	In a normal society, learning leads to questioning	16
11374	3589	But for them there is no learning, just accepting	17
11375	3589	And acceptance leads to contentness, which in the end leads to unhappiness	18
11376	3589	The society in '@CAPS1 @NUM1' proves to be oblivious to everything that is going on in many different ways	19
11377	3589	To them, death is not a big deal	20
11378	3589	@PERSON2 was killed by a speeding car, and @PERSON4, @CAPS4 wife, was not even shocked to hear it	21
11379	3589	Another example is when @PERSON3 was running from the police, and a car full of rambunxious teenagers attempted to run him over just because they wanted to	22
11380	3589	At the end of the novel, @PERSON3 is walking along the railroad tracks with his new friends and the entire city is blown to dust by bombs dropped by fighter planes	23
11381	3589	The city had no idea that this was going to happen, they were clueless to the war that was going on around them everyday	24
11382	3589	A clueless society is a useless society, and in the end they were destroyed	25
11383	3589	Censorship lies within the hands of the viewer	26
11384	3589	Censorship has become such a big problem in the world when there are so many other things people should worry about	27
11385	3589	Reading about somebody doing drugs will not make a child want to do drugs, it crosses every teenagers mind atleast once	28
11386	3589	But instead of not allowing them to even realize that it is out there, parents should do what they signed up to do, teach your kids right from wrong and hope that you did it well.	29
11387	3591	Offensive or @CAPS1	0
11388	3591	Who can truely say a book, movie, music, or magazine is truely offensive	1
11389	3591	There are some of the obvious movies that completely make fun of or taunt someone's personal views as a religion or lifestyle but is a book about a wizarding world really that offensive	2
11390	3591	While growing up I had a friend who was very religious	3
11391	3591	Her parents would never let her read the @ORGANIZATION1 books by @PERSON1	4
11392	3591	At the time I didn't understand why she wasn't able to read such fantastic books	5
11393	3591	Now that I'm older I understand that her parents believe what is in 'The @CAPS2' and nothing more	6
11394	3591	Make believe and imagination was @CAPS1 a suitable thing fpr their child to read	7
11395	3591	For many families, though the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 series is nothing but a different world in which they can set themselves free from the real world	8
11396	3591	Should a book that many people love and adore be taken off shelves because some families are offended	9
11397	3591	I personally don't think they should	10
11398	3591	While my family loves the books and movies some families don't	11
11399	3591	That is their lifestyle and their opinion	12
11400	3591	Everyone has an opinion, and if we took out everything in this world that could offend someone we would be left with nothing	13
11401	3591	Movies would be boring, stories would @CAPS1 be interesting, and there would be no music	14
11402	3591	If our world was based off of the opinions of others and making everyone happy we would @CAPS1 have music	15
11403	3591	Music is a way for someone to release their soul	16
11404	3591	The different sounds of music are based off generations	17
11405	3591	My mother's generation was based on @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 and mine is of @CAPS6, @CAPS7&@CAPS8, @CAPS9	18
11406	3591	So what would really happen if all the offensive materials were taken off the shelves of a public library or say a @ORGANIZATION2	19
11407	3591	The shelves would be blank	20
11408	3591	Empty shelves would be a horrible look	21
11409	3591	Everyone is offended by something	22
11410	3591	I'm offended by the rape scences in movies but some people believe in some situations it makes a movie better	23
11411	3591	My friend's family is offended by the make believe world of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and I believe that some where out in our world there is another world, a wizarding world as a matter of fact	24
11412	3591	People believe in many different things and like many different things	25
11413	3591	I've never met one person who is exactly like me, because there is @CAPS1 one	26
11414	3591	I'm an individual like everyone else and if the things I liked were taken off a shelf because someone was offended then my life would be boring because I wouldn't have the things I enjoy	27
11415	3591	In some cases some offensive things should be taken off shelves but who am I to say it should be, because there is someone out there who believes it should be on the shelves of @LOCATION1	28
11416	3592	As said before there would be no books for anyone to read if everybody removed what they felt was offensive	0
11417	3592	The libraries would have a very watered down material base and there would be no reason to use this place anymore	1
11418	3592	Some material is not suitable for young ages there is much from advanced material that can be learned	2
11419	3592	thus the libraries should sperate their books only as they do already	3
11420	3592	Some material does seem to advanced for others but these materials are needed to advance academic gwroth	4
11421	3592	Some people should think that school should not read @PERSON1 due to racism in the south	5
11422	3592	This was true history so there should be no restrictions to that sort of book	6
11423	3592	If there were those soprt of restrictions then schools would lack much of histories best literature	7
11424	3592	Just as the movies do for the gerneal population, @CAPS1 is for @NUM1 and up while @NUM2 is for @NUM3 and up	8
11425	3592	These are good standard that keep the youth from seeing what they are not yet ready for	9
11426	3592	This concept should be used the same way in these libraries where there seems to be a problem.Yet this is already done in libraries	10
11427	3592	There would be no reason to break these sectiopns up more then they already are broken	11
11428	3592	There is the young adult section, adult, and youth	12
11429	3592	Those are the main catagories that most perople want sperate due to offensivce material such as drugs, sex, and alchohol	13
11430	3592	Much of the media that is public today is censered and that benefits much of the youth, but there is a point where the public needs to realize that sheltering the outh can stunt them academically	14
11431	3593	Are books and other things found in libraries offensive to some	0
11432	3593	Why is it offensive and how is it offensive	1
11433	3593	What should be done about the books, movies, magazines, and movies that are offensive to some of the people	2
11434	3593	In my opinion there are some books that I could think of that are offensive to others for particular reasons	3
11435	3593	Some reasons @MONTH1 include: the put down on races, comments in the book, how the author wrote it and who it was written towards	4
11436	3593	Others find some books, music, magazines, and movies offensive because of the terms people use	5
11437	3593	Some people just get offended because they think it's directed toward them, and they take it personal	6
11438	3593	Music can be offensive to some people becasue of the language they use in it	7
11439	3593	They might look down on it because their children @MONTH1 listen to it, and children nowadays say things they here from music and try to be like the person saying it	8
11440	3593	Movies can be offensive because of the language, violence, the way people are treated	9
11441	3593	A good movie would be @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3	10
11442	3593	It has violence, language, and people are treated in a harmful way	11
11443	3593	But overall the movie teaches you about war and the things they've gone through to get our country to where it is today	12
11444	3593	Magazines could be offensive by the words used, such as slang words, cursing words, and violent words	13
11445	3593	The magazines could have nude pictures of people and most parents do not want their children getting ahold of things like that	14
11446	3593	Overall, I think that any of these things could be offensive to some people, and probably are, but they shouldn't take it off the shelf because it's offensive to some	15
11447	3593	If you'd look at it in a certain way everything in the library could be offensive to someone, and if the case is take everything that's offensive they might have to take everything that's in the library	16
11448	3593	So, I do not find it right for them to take away things that are ofensive to some people	17
11449	3593	If it offends you then don't read it or listen to it or even look at it, no one is pressuring you to do it, you do it on your own	18
11450	3593	So therefore it's  not right to take the things off the shelves just because some people do not like it.	19
11451	3594	Censorship	0
11452	3594	What is it	1
11453	3594	Well from what i know cenorship is where you are blocked from certin things that you are not able to ever bring into the place that blocked it	2
11454	3594	So the question is it wrong to censor something or not, i think that libraries should be able to censor certins things that people find offensive	3
11455	3594	First reason why i think it is right that people should be able to censor things is becuase little childeren could be able to take at peek at what they shouldn't be looking at, when it comes to magazines and also movies	4
11456	3594	Next reason why i think labraries should be able to cenor is because people can find centin things offensive just as music, for example like vulgar language can be listened to and aslo also naughty things can be watched in movies	5
11457	3594	My last reasoning why i think it is fair that libraries are able censor things is beacuase some people like to read but in thier reading can be bad things that they find offensive and they can always find a way to take an item out from a labrary	6
11458	3594	These are reasons why i think they should be able to censor books, music, movies, and also magazines	7
11459	3594	My first reasoning in why i think it is fair that libraries are able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines is because little childeren could be able to look at things things they should not be able to take a peek at	8
11460	3594	Thses things could be like pronogaphy, and also really grusome things in magazines and in movies	9
11461	3594	If these things were in labraries they can possibly show other childeren, inwhich it would not be good	10
11462	3594	This can be a problem beacuase parents can put the blame on the libraries by saying that the workers didn't do a good job at watching out for the children	11
11463	3594	Also i think think they should be able to censor movies beacuse little childern shouls not be watching gursome movies at a young age	12
11464	3594	This can really hurt them and others if they learn and see what is on this movies and magazines	13
11465	3594	Also labraries can censor music	14
11466	3594	I also think libraries can censor music beacause in music these days there are very bad things that any body can find that is offensive	15
11467	3594	Little childern can be listenig to vulgar lyrics that are in the songs and they could be repeating it to other people	16
11468	3594	This can be bad in many ways because first of all they might not know what they are saying,  so if one day they say it to an adult, that adult can put the blame on the library owners	17
11469	3594	Also they should be able to censor movies again beacuse naughty things can be shown in those movies that certin age levels should not be able to see	18
11470	3594	These are ressons why libraries have a right to censor music and movies	19
11471	3594	They aslo have right to censor books	20
11472	3594	Books in they libraries are great but some books should not be able to be in a library, certin books such as books about faith and other religions	21
11473	3594	And also about gursome items	22
11474	3594	Some people can find books about religion and faith to be very offensive because some people @MONTH1 not see eye to eye about other religions	23
11475	3594	And to minimize this problem libraries can take these books out so peolpe won't find it be offensive	24
11476	3594	And also libraries should be censoring certin books about death because it can really get to a person and they can show other people that will find it very offensive	25
11477	3594	So this is why i think libraries should be able to censor things	26
11478	3594	In conclusion libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines, because in some books they can have religion problems and problems with death,  movies beacuse in some movies it can show pronography and gursome things that peopel should not be watching,  and they should be able to censor magazines and music beacuse in magazines childern could be looking at certin things they shouls not be looking at	27
11479	3594	And they should be able to censor music beacuse peopel can be offended if they ever listen to vulgar language	28
11480	3594	So in other words i do think libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines	29
11481	3595	Libraries are for children, and adults of all ages	0
11482	3595	Because all people have different views on life, different beliefs, and different feelings, @CAPS4 makes @CAPS4 hard for libraries to please everyone	1
11483	3595	There are also different genres that people enjoy reading	2
11484	3595	Some @MONTH1 enjoy romance and comedy, while others like to read action books or mysteries	3
11485	3595	Today, libraries have sections dedicated to different genres of materials	4
11486	3595	They have kids, fiction, informational, and many more	5
11487	3595	They also have different areas where you can find movies or magazines	6
11488	3595	But, if there are magazines, books, or movies, that should be viewed only by certain ages, the library should put a warning sign in the areas where those materials are located	7
11489	3595	On the back of movies there is a rateing on @CAPS1 bad the movie is	8
11490	3595	Why not put a rateing on the back of books and magazines	9
11491	3595	This way people can know what to expect if they read @CAPS4	10
11492	3595	@CAPS4 would also help them decide if they even want to read @CAPS4	11
11493	3595	Rateings on the back of magazines and books would help destinguish what age is appropriate for @CAPS4	12
11494	3595	Once, when i was visiting the library, there was a man in the check out line, right before me	13
11495	3595	@CAPS3 was returning the book that @CAPS3 had just read and checking out the new one @CAPS3 had already picked out	14
11496	3595	When @CAPS4 was finally his turn in line @CAPS3 stepped up to the counter and explained to the sweet, old, lady at the front desk, what @CAPS3 had wanted to do with his books	15
11497	3595	She simply understood that @CAPS3 wanted to check out and return one	16
11498	3595	As she was checking him out she was making small talk and asked, '@CAPS1 did you like your book, @CAPS2?' @CAPS3 replied ' @CAPS4 wasn't what i expected	17
11499	3595	@CAPS4 was completly inappropriate	18
11500	3595	' As they disscussed a little more @CAPS4 turned out that there were tons of curse words throughout the entire book	19
11501	3595	This is one example of @CAPS1 people don't know what to expect when they read a book	20
11502	3595	I don't think that libraries should remove materials off the shelves that people have complained about	21
11503	3595	They should simply do something to let people know what to expect when they read the books, magazines, or movies	22
11504	3595	Some people @MONTH1 not mind reading a book with a few curse words here and there, but others @MONTH1 find @CAPS4 outragous	23
11505	3595	Libraries spend their money to buy these books for the communities	24
11506	3595	Why take a book off if only a few people find @CAPS4 offensive	25
11507	3595	No one makes those people read those books, its by their choice	26
11508	3595	Libraries need to figure out some way to reasure people that they will enjoy what they are reading and not be offended by @CAPS4	27
11509	3596	Should They or Should They @CAPS1	0
11510	3596	What do you think	1
11511	3596	Music, books, movies and many others have been questioned either about there apperence or what they say	2
11512	3596	Most people bring up the fact that young children should @CAPS1 be hearing this or haveing to read about it at such a young age, but the children have ideas of their own	3
11513	3596	In my personal opinion i do @CAPS1 think that they should have to be taken off the shelf or from being sold	4
11514	3596	What does everyone else think though	5
11515	3596	Is it a bad idea to keep them up and let the kids learn about it at such a young age or does it help teach them @CAPS1 to be like that	6
11516	3596	One of the main reasons why I think it should be left alone as is so that the children can read it	7
11517	3596	They must learn the good from the bad sometime	8
11518	3596	Its better that children learn at a young age and just trying to keep things from them will make them want it more	9
11519	3596	Lets use music for example, some music is nothing but screaming and cursing	10
11520	3596	In real life though alot of kids have to listen to there parents fight and yell	11
11521	3596	So, why dont they get the choice to listen to it whenever they want to	12
11522	3596	There are also the bad things to keeping them out on the shelvs	13
11523	3596	As a mother and also a teenager I feel like as if  I should have the choice to do as I please but at the same time there is no way I would ever let my daughter hear or read some of the things I do	14
11524	3596	That get me to my next point	15
11525	3596	If you really have a problem with some of the things out there why would you let your childern get it	16
11526	3596	As being a teegager I would go out and buy a lot of music I shouldnt be listening to, but even if my daughter was @NUM1 there is no way I would let her get it	17
11527	3596	After all I am the parent right	18
11528	3596	I have every say in what my daughter can and can't do	19
11529	3596	So do you over your own child	20
11530	3596	If other parents have no say in what there child gets just because they don't care, well thats @CAPS1 your problem	21
11531	3596	There should,however, be age limits on what some are allowed to get parent permission or @CAPS1	22
11532	3596	Books with sex scenes and murder should @CAPS1 be allowed into they @NUM2 year old books	23
11533	3596	Sure, teenagers think they know it all but they still shouldnt be allowed to read something that adults do	24
11534	3596	Most @NUM1 year olds don't hear about all the drugs, sex, or teen prganacy	25
11535	3596	As much as they should get information on it, have there parents pick out what book they should read to find out about that kind of thing	26
11536	3596	I think that in every library that has sexual books and alot of curse words should be put in a specific location that only adults can get to	27
11537	3596	Video games have to put an age limit on things so why shouldn't books have to have the same exact thing	28
11538	3596	The only reason they have'nt done anything so far is beacuse @CAPS1 enought parents care.This is your chance to get up and show them that you want to make a change, that you won't let your kids hear about things without your knowing	29
11539	3596	This brings me to my conclusion	30
11540	3596	Where are the parents out there	31
11541	3596	Why arn't you stepping in and showing people the right way to live	32
11542	3596	Make your nearest library have age limits on what the little young ones can read	33
11543	3596	See if the books you are letting your son/daughter check out are age worthy or @CAPS1	34
11544	3596	Last but @CAPS1 least try to talk your libraien into makeing groups of books	35
11545	3596	Some for the youngre kids some for the older	36
11546	3596	Woulnt kill for you to put your say in and try to get this kind of thing under control and @CAPS1 just removed	37
11547	3596	Why remove other people's interests when you can just put an age limit on it and @CAPS1 let your child get a hold of it	38
11548	3596	Today is the day!!Make a say!!	39
11549	3598	Reading it is a joy to some and a pain to others	0
11550	3598	Do I think objects in the library with offensive details should be cleaned up or taken off the shelves	1
11551	3598	There are some things that could be censored, and others that wouldn't be worth using if it was censored	2
11552	3598	However, yes I do believe that there are items in the library that could be censored	3
11553	3598	I am going to tell you why they should be censored, and what should be censored	4
11554	3598	The types of items in the library that shouldn't be cleaned up	5
11555	3598	A perfect example of those items are historical documentaries or historical books they have no other way to get the information needed across to the reader or viewer	6
11556	3598	There are other types of library items in the library that could be censored	7
11557	3598	Like there are some magazines and movies that show uncensored scenes or pages that are not need to make a view across if there even is a view to get across	8
11558	3598	I think a movie, book, or a magazine should only be uncensored if it is trying to get a point across	9
11559	3598	If there are uncensored items not getting a point across then they have no business being in the library	10
11560	3598	As people can see library there are circumstances where a book, movie, or magazine uncensored is very useful in getting information	11
11561	3598	There are more circumstances where a library item does not need uncensored details because it is just offensive	12
11562	3598	If you ask me if I think censorship is important in libraries than I would have to say yes and no	13
11563	3598	I just gave you some reasons why I would say that	14
11564	3598	The next time you are in the library looking for a book ask your self one question is it to offensive to be important.	15
11565	3600	Parents should tell their kids what they are allowed to read at certain ages	0
11566	3600	That is where my opinion will start, and tell why it is that way	1
11567	3600	I will talk about why I disagree with this statement	2
11568	3600	Also, give reasons on why i feel this way about the statement	3
11569	3600	I really think that anyone should be able to read the kind of books that they like	4
11570	3600	The library is where they get the books from	5
11571	3600	So, just because a parent does not want their child to read a certain book doesn't mean that the book shouldn't be there	6
11572	3600	I think that parents need to tell their children why they do not want them to read a book	7
11573	3600	If the parents explain, kids will understand why it is not good for them	8
11574	3600	Those type of books are what older people like and they are very interesting	9
11575	3600	I think if people understand what the book talks about and if it does not bother them, then they are old enough for it	10
11576	3600	Also, the young kids that should not be reading these books should have and adult or guardian with them, therefore they can stop the kid from reading something that is not appropriate	11
11577	3600	Something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it	12
11578	3600	This is taking a right away from us, and we should not have to go buy the book and only read it once	13
11579	3600	If these books are so horrible than why would people still be writing them	14
11580	3600	So, if they have not bothered people that bad yet then there is no reason for people to not like it now	15
11581	3600	People should be able to do what they enjoy and not have that taken from them	16
11582	3600	This is my opinion of the statement	17
11583	3600	Many people @MONTH1 not agree but I just tried to make people to see my point of this statement	18
11584	3600	Then everyone can help stop people taking things away from the community that makes them happy	19
11585	3600	Also, I hope people can still have their rights and not let a couple people take it away from them.	20
11586	3601	Television, news, drama, life, and controversy	0
11587	3601	These are just a few of the things books are written about	1
11588	3601	Some subjects are considered to be vulgar and innappropriate for young audiences	2
11589	3601	Many people believe that their children have a right to learn about all the things books can offer, but is that really such a good thing	3
11590	3601	Books have been an important tool for students for a long time	4
11591	3601	However, not all books should be considered appropriate for all audiences	5
11592	3601	Stories about knights and princesses are great for young people, but other stories about the darker sides of life are normally kept away from the hands of children	6
11593	3601	Books are censored for all sorts of reasons	7
11594	3601	Some of these reasons are frivelous and should not keep a book from reaching it's full potential	8
11595	3601	The truth is that there is a line that should not be crossed, and some books cross this line, and are banned	9
11596	3601	Great	10
11597	3601	However, some books do not 'cross the line' and are banned regardless	11
11598	3601	Honestly, careful consideration must be taken before the decision is made to ban a book or to leave it on shelves	12
11599	3601	If a book is written with only minor obscenities by a recognized author, and it is banned, then the author faces no serious pressure as the banning will be well known and consumers will still purchase the book just for a chance to read it	13
11600	3601	However, if an author who is relatively unknown writes a well-put-together piece that contains a few spots where the author @MONTH1 have made a somewhat vulgar reference, and the book is banned, the author is in serious trouble	14
11601	3601	This author can no longer have the luxury of having their book in libraries so that their work @MONTH1 be recognized	15
11602	3601	Banning books is hindering authors everywhere from being able to make a name for themselves	16
11603	3601	Books that are especially vulgar should definitely be banned	17
11604	3601	No child should be reading a book that has an intended audience of purely adults	18
11605	3601	Children should be protected from such material, and book banning provides this service	19
11606	3601	If a child has a burning desire to read a book, they can simply ask their parents to buy it for them, assuming the parents agree that filthy books should be okay for children to read	20
11607	3601	If a book can provide good discussion in a classroom setting, and is mostly 'clean', then it should certainly be available for everyone	21
11608	3601	Just because a book contains a few areas where innappropriate references are made doesn't mean that students shouldn't be able to read the book	22
11609	3601	If the learning material a book offers 'outweighs' the negative effects the book @MONTH1 have on a student, then the book should be available for students to read	23
11610	3601	However, because one cannot effectively compare knowledge and harmful effects, this is a difficult statement to make	24
11611	3601	Honestly, it is too difficult to say whether small problems in a book should be considered vulgar enough to ban a book	25
11612	3601	Many books should not be as available as others, but using a new system to find which books to limit would be too difficult, and keeping the current one would make more sense than any other alternatives	26
11613	3601	In the end, a system that caters to the most sheltering of parents is the best one.	27
11614	3602	I believe there should not be censorship in libraries, because if some needs to read a book about somthing and the library does not have it beacuse they do not believe or like what the book as to say it makes the reader not know what actually	0
11615	3602	The very first reason in believe there should not be any censorship in librarys is beacuse a lot of student go there to study about papers.So if the library does not have the book that a student is looking for the library is failing its maine purpose	1
11616	3602	The sencond reason is that if the person in chage of the library does not like a book that does not mean he or she has to read the book books are ment for any one and everyone to read	2
11617	3602	Then the third  is that a library is ment to have books so people can read them so if the owner takes the book out and some need that one book and the person can not get the information that they neeed out of that one bookthe library is faling its maine purpose	3
11618	3602	The fourth reason is that alot of people read books to read about something and just beacuse he or she does not like what the book has to say does not give them the right to take the book	4
11619	3602	Those are the three mane reasons i think librays should not have censorship	5
11620	3602	The owner of the library should have any book possibel and should not shose to not put a book in it beacuse he ore she does not like what the book says.	6
11621	3605	Censorship in Libraries     Censorship in libraries is a big problem in today's society, many people get angry at libraries and markets because of the items that they have on display for the common consumer	0
11622	3605	If the consumer walks into a library and is looking for a book to read	1
11623	3605	What if they come accross a book from the early @DATE1's	2
11624	3605	In these times there were lots of words used that are 'harmful' to our people today, but what most people dont understand is that, these words that are harmful had different meanings in that time in history	3
11625	3605	So when someone picks up a book and finds harmful or un-appropriate words or phrases in them, they instantly get the wrong idea about the book	4
11626	3605	And then, this small group of people who dont like this piece of literature, go agains the vast majority of people who really do understand the literature, and the feeling and dialect of the book	5
11627	3605	That is where i am going to explain to this small group of people, a few details that they should keep in mind when trying to rip a book off of the shelf and throwing it away	6
11628	3605	When someone goes into a store or library and starts to look for a book, they @MONTH1 come accross a piece of literature that they dont completely agree with	7
11629	3605	When this person comes across this piece of literature, all they have to do is put it back on the shelf and move on	8
11630	3605	Nobody is forcing that person to read this book, so why make a big deal about it	9
11631	3605	Because most people who make a big deal about some of the word usage in a book, dont quite understand the dialect of the book, or the time period the book was written in	10
11632	3605	If you do not understand the literature completely, then i ask that these people do not make a big scene out of it, and that they dont try to revoke the author's rights to have that piece of literature on the shelf	11
11633	3605	Authors have just as many rights as we do	12
11634	3605	If they write literature	13
11635	3605	A poem, novel, or even a short story, these authors have the right to have it published and put on the shelf	14
11636	3605	So why would we not have the same rights	15
11637	3605	If we dont agree with some of the literature that are being placed in our society's schools, stores, and homes	16
11638	3605	Then we can write a novel, newspaper article, or even make a website about your topic	17
11639	3605	You can make web polls much more	18
11640	3605	This is a more indirect approach to removing a piece of literature	19
11641	3605	If you want to have a better chance of this book or novel to be removed from the shelves, you can use a poll or have people vote, to recieve other people's oppinions, and use these in your argument	20
11642	3605	If you have more than one oppinion on a subject, you @MONTH1 have a more likely chance of winning your argument	21
11643	3605	And this will cause a lot less chaos and attention to be drawn to yourself and others around you	22
11644	3605	Another reason why i dont think that people should be able to choose what is on the shelves of libraries everywhere	23
11645	3605	I do not think that anybody from anywhere shoudl be able to come into a library and take a piece of literature off of the shelves forever	24
11646	3605	Because, in todays society, we have researchers going all of the time, and we have so many people working on different theories and laws	25
11647	3605	So if we take one important book off of the shelf, maybe a book written in the @DATE2's about evolution	26
11648	3605	And we get rid of all of these books, what will happen when we really need that information	27
11649	3605	These scientists @MONTH1 need that piece of literature to test a theory, and if that piece of literature is expelled from the shelves, then we could miss out on a large variety of major information that could help out someone in the future	28
11650	3605	So the more information we take off of the shelves, the less we will have in the future to help us will our problems	29
11651	3605	So, now that i have told you all of my opinions on this subject, i hope that you will have a better view on the cencorship of libraries everywhere	30
11652	3605	And that maybe someday all books and pieces of literature will be able to remain on the shelves, being endlessly read by consumers	31
11653	3606	Curse words, alcohol, drugs, pornigraphic pictures	0
11654	3606	These are all things you would not like your children to use, see, or do	1
11655	3606	They are out in the world and and there is nothing that you can do to stop it	2
11656	3606	People do drugs and drink everyday, but just because someone sees you doing it doesnt mean they will too	3
11657	3606	People should not be shielded from the real aspects of life	4
11658	3606	When shielded as a child they would not know what do to if the chances came to them to do drugs or drink	5
11659	3606	They @MONTH1 not even know what the right or wrong thing to do is	6
11660	3606	Kids to a certain age deserve to know whats going to happen in the real world when they grow up and start a life	7
11661	3606	It won't happen to everyone but they need to know these things	8
11662	3606	It is important for parents to let their children know what is right or what is wrong	9
11663	3606	As an adolesent, they are very vulnerable to all the bad stuff that life can bring	10
11664	3606	Seeing these things in books, movies, magazines and etc	11
11665	3606	will effect their life in some way	12
11666	3606	It is their job to show them the right path	13
11667	3606	A thing that helps these parents are restrictions on the stuff that you are able to get your hands on	14
11668	3606	On movies there are age restrictions that inable people at a certian age to be able to watch and people that are within those guidelines to have access	15
11669	3606	With other materials like books, music, and magazines, there is no way to deny access to people to see or read them	16
11670	3606	Parents just need to be observent to their children and see what they do	17
11671	3606	Censorship is normally a bad thing, but in others it could help	18
11672	3606	For people that are more vulnerable to those situations or seeing those things, it could greatly help with some people and show them that it is not right	19
11673	3606	As much as people should be open and be able have access to this information, it is also important that other people did not see it	20
11674	3606	It is still an open debate, but, in opinion, censorship should not be done	21
11675	3606	Everyone had their own right to get and see the things they want	22
11676	3607	In libraries and bookstores worldwide books are written and published with subject matter ranging from odd or inappropriate, to serious or violent	0
11677	3607	These books are written to target emotions in the reader that spark excitement and humor, horror and empathy among many others	1
11678	3607	However, though these books are made for a specific purpose, it is sometimes unclear as to how the book is appropriate for the eyes of a young reader, or even a mature reader	2
11679	3607	These books appear unappealing and offensive	3
11680	3607	However, though they don't appeal to you as a reader, how could this book be censored without the unanimous disapproval of everyone	4
11681	3607	Censorship of these books is unjust because of the right of free speech and press, because all subjects are deserving of being written, and most importantly because target audiences deserve books written in their interest regardless of their approval	5
11682	3607	The first reason that their should be no censorship of novels and works of literature is because writers deserve the freedoms of speech and press	6
11683	3607	They are aloud to voice their own opinions and write about the subject matter that they are most interested in	7
11684	3607	Though many times they have used subject matter that is highly provocative or inappropriate, they still have the capacity and the legal ability to write about what they wish	8
11685	3607	To stop them from writing their own opinionated stories is similar to the censorship of books in nazi @LOCATION1	9
11686	3607	Millions of books were burned and hundreds, if not thousands of writers were executed for conveying opinions in their work that conflicted with the ideas of their government	10
11687	3607	Even though there are books not written for all ages they are still deserving of a reader	11
11688	3607	The next reason that books should not have censorship is because new ideas cover topics that have never been discussed	12
11689	3607	Books and stories are meant to push the mark of what has been written and what can be written	13
11690	3607	The variety of literature is the reason why it is so popular	14
11691	3607	For thousands of years, written text has been a way to understand and connect with cultures and people through written language	15
11692	3607	And though stories @MONTH1 not be written in a manner that would be appropriate for a child, it doesn't mean that the story shouldn't be written or read	16
11693	3607	Its use should simply be monitored so that only those capable of accepting or understanding its message are capable of reading it	17
11694	3607	Lastly, censorship is simply unjust because without it there is a better chance to discuss and attempt to describe stories that target a vast crowd of people	18
11695	3607	Though the materials found in a story @MONTH1 be horrific to a parent, it @MONTH1 be a preferred form of literature for a different group of people	19
11696	3607	And to limit the literary subjects that people prefer could be parallelled with limiting a person's voice of opinion	20
11697	3607	It simply isn't reasonable to allow only a single category of work, with only a few varieties of messages, for only a select group of people	21
11698	3607	Variety is what seperates a person's opinions, and makes their being different than another's	22
11699	3607	Therefore, censorship of literature should not be enforced	23
11700	3607	Writing topics should be open to all people, because whether they are offensive or not they convey a purpose	24
11701	3607	And because writers have the right to illustrate their points through a literal medium, there should never be a limit on these rights	25
11702	3607	That is why censorship should never be able to remove a piece of literature from any shelf.	26
11703	3608	Well do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all music you listen to is offensive	0
11704	3608	Who can say what is offensive to everyone	1
11705	3608	Who can tell you what you think is offensive or not	2
11706	3608	How can you be your own person if people are making desisions for you about the books you read, the movies you watch, and the music you listen to	3
11707	3608	I'm going to tell you about why I think that no certain materials such as books, movie, music, magazines, ect., should be taken off library selves because someone finds them offensive	4
11708	3608	Who can be the ultimate decision maker in deciding if something is offensive to everyone	5
11709	3608	Everyone has their own meaning of offensive	6
11710	3608	Everyone thinks that different things are offensive to them	7
11711	3608	How can you say that one thing is offensive to one person and is also offensive to another person?	8
11712	3608	I think if one person thinks that something is offensive to them that is ok, that is their own opioion, but maybe the next person that walks by and see's the so call offensive material will love it	9
11713	3608	You should not be able to make someone elses decisions for them if they want to read an offensive book, watch an offensive movie, and or listen to offensive music that is their chose not someone elses to make for them	10
11714	3608	If every peson took a book off the selves that they thought to be offensive then we would not longer have any books on the selves	11
11715	3608	Some people think that certain music, books, and movies are offensive and other people think that the books, music, and movies are cool and interesting so what do you do then	12
11716	3608	I have learned over the years that not every person will agree with your opinions on everything and you won't agree with them but yet you both still have your own opinions	13
11717	3608	You both are allowed to decide what you do and dont like	14
11718	3608	You both get to choose what books you read, what movies you watch, and what music you listen to	15
11719	3608	So why should we let anyone stop us from being ourselves	16
11720	3608	You can never say that anyone thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can be everyone	17
11721	3608	You can't talk for someone else because everyone has a voice for themselves	18
11722	3608	So do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all the music you listen to is offensive	19
11723	3608	well you @MONTH1 not but someone else somewhere is trying to take that out of the libraries because they have a negative opinion about it but is that fair?	20
11724	3609	Imagine your child or someone that is very close to you	0
11725	3609	He's only around @NUM1 old just starting to learn how to be an adult and take on responibliltys	1
11726	3609	He wants to try new things	2
11727	3609	He listeans to his friends talking about drinking alchol and how much fun is it	3
11728	3609	He thinks it sounds amazing to drink	4
11729	3609	He dosnt no something is bad about it or not	5
11730	3609	No one every told him	6
11731	3609	So he starts to drink an dlater died of alchol posing	7
11732	3609	Now, you dont want this to ever happen to someone who is very close to you	8
11733	3609	If people are to scared to talk about the bad things in life	9
11734	3609	Like sex, drugs, etc..Then they should make books and movies to show how bad these thing are	10
11735	3609	There should not be censorship in libraries	11
11736	3609	Some of you @MONTH1 say 'well there to young they cant hanndle these things yet.' @CAPS1 your opinon you should think of there maturity level, aslo they can learn from other peoples mistakes, and it would educate people	12
11737	3609	How do you tell on someones maturity level	13
11738	3609	There are many ways to tell	14
11739	3609	If you talk to someone about sex and they start to laugh and make jokes then there not very mature	15
11740	3609	But, you cant asociate that every @NUM2 year old is immature	16
11741	3609	Many people @MONTH1 take this as a serious thing	17
11742	3609	Others @MONTH1 not but, they still will be able to see them in there own way	18
11743	3609	Putting censorship in libraries would not be a good idea	19
11744	3609	Many topics in books, movies, music, magazines, etc.	20
11745	3609	@MONTH1 have inapropte things in them	21
11746	3609	Like sex, drugs, drinking, bad language	22
11747	3609	Should all these things be taken out on libraires and off the shevles	23
11748	3609	@CAPS1 a hard question to answer	24
11749	3609	But, what you can answer from that is it would allow people to learn from there mistakes	25
11750	3609	If theres a movie and a guy and he is doing drugs and later dies	26
11751	3609	People could assume that drugs kill you	27
11752	3609	But, what about the other thing	28
11753	3609	Its hard to show how its bad to say an offensive word to someone, that they herd on the radio	29
11754	3609	But, when they here that word or read about something or watch	30
11755	3609	They can ask about it and we can say that saing those things or doing them can be offensive	31
11756	3609	Now, can you educate someone from letting the person listean, read , or watch about something offensive or etc..	32
11757	3609	It depends on the person	33
11758	3609	But, you can educate someone about the subject matter	34
11759	3609	No matter how offensive the topic is	35
11760	3609	We should teach people about them	36
11761	3609	If we dont, its bound to repeat it self	37
11762	3609	Say if we censor the holocaust becuase of how horifying it was	38
11763	3609	No one would no about it and we would most likely repeat the holocaust	39
11764	3609	Censoring certain things a library would not be that good of an idea	40
11765	3609	Ceratin people can hanndle talking about certain subjects	41
11766	3609	Its not always a good thing to censor offensive subjects	42
11767	3609	We need to teach people about these thing to educate them, and also so they can learn on what has been done and not repeat it, also some people can handle these materials, they just need to have a high maturitly level	43
11768	3609	These are some reasons why there should not be censorship in libraries and other places	44
11769	3610	Offensive books do belong in the library, just in a completely different area, away from the children	0
11770	3610	If we all chose a book that we didn't want in the library, there would be none left	1
11771	3610	So, since everyone has a different opinion about what is offensvie and what isn't, who's to say what can and can't be in the library	2
11772	3610	When I was little, my grandma would take me to the library almost every @DATE1	3
11773	3610	I noticed that she tried to keep me from getting certain books and was fine with others	4
11774	3610	My @CAPS1 did the same thing, but they had different opinions on what was okay for me to read and what wasn't	5
11775	3610	Grandma wanted me to get religious books and @CAPS1 was okay with that and things like '@CAPS2 the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5', and '@PERSON1'	6
11776	3610	Even at home, everyone's opinion is very different	7
11777	3610	For instance, when it comes to music at my house	8
11778	3610	@CAPS1 likes country, @CAPS7 likes metal, my brother likes alternative, my unlcle likes rock, and I like a combonation of all of it	9
11779	3610	That just does to show how different people have different opinions	10
11780	3610	some more strict than others	11
11781	3610	If we relied on peoples' opinions to keep our librarys free of offense, there would be nothing in it	12
11782	3612	What is a library	0
11783	3612	A library is a place you go to that has books, movies, music, magazines, etc	1
11784	3612	With these things a person can do research or use for entertainment	2
11785	3612	Should there be censorship in libraries	3
11786	3612	In my opinion there should be very @CAPS2 censorship in a library	4
11787	3612	If there was a complaint about being offended by something in the library and it was removed from the shelf, there would be nothing left to use in the library	5
11788	3612	Many people like to go to the library to relax and have some good peace and quiet time and while there at the library they let their minds flow, imaginate, and dream	6
11789	3612	They don't worry about being offended by a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 book	7
11790	3612	However censorship in a library can be a good thing if used delicately	8
11791	3612	For example, moving grown up books to a section where children will not read them and have nightmares about a picture they saw in it	9
11792	3612	What I'm trying to say is have censorship in the library, but at a very low standard	10
11793	3612	If a library had high censorship and everything was taken off the shelf what is the point of going to the library, it would be an empty room	11
11794	3612	If someone is offended by something in the library, depending on how severe they where offended take the appropiate measures	12
11795	3612	For instance if something just offended someone unintentionaly leave it where it is, but if something offends someone intentionaly by their race, ethnicity or something like that, it would then be appropriate to take it off the shelf	13
11796	3612	Having low censorship in libraries would be good because there would be a good quantity of stuff for you to do your research on and there would be more topics to choose from to let your imagination soar	14
11797	3612	While at the same time you would not have to worry about being severely offended	15
11798	3613	Cennsorship in Libraries       To remove something a person dislikes off of a shelf, is assuming other peoples opinions don't count	0
11799	3613	It really has to depend on what the product is	1
11800	3613	Such as a book, magazine, music album, or a movie	2
11801	3613	Usually in any store i've walked into, there are certain departments for each product	3
11802	3613	In these seperate departments, the product is always catagorized	4
11803	3613	Not from what people like, but by genera or age differences	5
11804	3613	If a person was to linger away from their section in that department and go to another part, their taste in their product will seem too different to like	6
11805	3613	A local library in a persons commuinty will have many books to read and to choose from	7
11806	3613	There are baby books, kids sections, teenage and adults sections as well	8
11807	3613	The teenage section is for me	9
11808	3613	Although I used to always be in the kids section not that long ago, those books should now be removed because I have no use for them or wouldn't be interested in picking another one up	10
11809	3613	Yet that is just me	11
11810	3613	However the generation under me will soon love them	12
11811	3613	Just because one person dislikes something, doesn't mean it should be thrown out for everyone else	13
11812	3613	Music is a different story	14
11813	3613	Some people like country and some people like alternative	15
11814	3613	In libraries they have all types of music albums that a person can listen to, before they rent it out	16
11815	3613	When I listen to one album to see if I like it and find out that I don't, I simply put it back on the shelf and try another one	17
11816	3613	The librarian doesn't throw it away because of my opinion, because to someone else it would be the sweetest music to their ears	18
11817	3613	Anyone can watch any type of movie in my opinion	19
11818	3613	Yet not all parents allow their twelve year old to watch a rated @CAPS1 movie	20
11819	3613	For them, it's only @NUM1 movies	21
11820	3613	This is how I grew up	22
11821	3613	Now that I am allowed to watch whatever my heart desires, i've noticed that movies are based on maturity levels	23
11822	3613	In libraries, some movies arn't allowed to be rented by a younger person	24
11823	3613	Yet it doesn't mean they should be tossed out	25
11824	3613	When they are older they might actually like them	26
11825	3613	Overall a persons opinion will be the most important one to them	27
11826	3613	Other opinions wont matter	28
11827	3613	Products in a library are for anyone to view, not to judge	29
11828	3613	If absolutly everyone did judge the products, there wouldn't be any left	30
11829	3614	I believe that it is unfair to ban ony sort of materials from the library	0
11830	3614	It simply isnt right to withold information from your children	1
11831	3614	Any information that they might read or hear is something that they are going to find out sooner or later anyway	2
11832	3614	Wouldn't you much rather your children find out from reading it in a book or magazine or hearing it in a movie or cd	3
11833	3614	Then they can ask parents any questions that they @MONTH1 have about things they have read and heard instead of hearing it from a teenager in the hall or talking to a friend about it and being misguided and given the wrong information	4
11834	3614	If your child is to read about sex or an affair in a magazine wouldnt you like to know	5
11835	3614	Would you want them to ask you questions about it so that they understand the difference between right and wrong	6
11836	3614	Wouldn't it be much easier to know that your child is educated on certian things so that they know when things are false and they're not confused or worried about something small	7
11837	3614	Any of the things that they @MONTH1 read in a magazine or see in a movie are things that they could easily look up on the internet	8
11838	3614	On the internet there are more graphic photos, and some websites give false information on subjects	9
11839	3614	Your childs curiosity could take them to inappropriate websites	10
11840	3614	When i was a child and I was curiouse my parents sheltered me from certian things	11
11841	3614	I found out what kinds of things they were trying to hide from me while I was only in @NUM1 grade when high schoolers on my bus told me all about sex, showed me pictures and told me things that I would have much rather heard about in class or read	12
11842	3614	I felt like I couldnt talk to my parents about these things	13
11843	3614	I mean what would you do if your second grader came home form school and started talking to you about the kinds of things that they had heard on the bus	14
11844	3614	What if the high schoolers had been lieing to me, I would feel stupid for saying anything about it because my parents wouldn't have understood what I was talking about	15
11845	3614	What I'm saying is that understand that there are some things that a child should never be allowed to read, see, or hear	16
11846	3614	It isn't fair to them that they don't get the opportunity themselves to learn about it and ask questions	17
11847	3614	Besides isn't it your fault in all reality if they get they're hands on somthing innapropriate for their age becuase they aren't getting the proper supervision	18
11848	3614	If you feel that they are reading, listening, or watching something that you feel is in appropriate, ask questions	19
11849	3614	Explain things to them when they ask you a question	20
11850	3614	Don't beat around the bush	21
11851	3614	Make sure that they know the difference between good and bad, right and wrong	22
11852	3614	It truely is not fair to take these things away from them when they don't even know why they are not allowed to look at it	23
11853	3615	No because all people like to read different books	0
11854	3615	Some of the books that people want taken off bookshelves are considered to be part of history.Books help people advance in their reading skills and also help them find new things out	1
11855	3615	When I was in middle school I always liked to read @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 books	2
11856	3615	When I asked the librarian if they had any of their books they said no	3
11857	3615	They thought that kids in middle school shouldn't be reading books with cuss words in them and vilence	4
11858	3615	I don't think it should matter what kids read because you can't make a kid read something that he's not interested in because everybody is different all people like different types of books	5
11859	3615	Theres all kinds of books like for example theres mystery books, fiction books, non-fiction books, historical books, etc	6
11860	3615	The books you use in classrooms are considered books but there not books you read everyday	7
11861	3615	I think parents should take their kids to the public library to get a book.When I was in elementry and through junior high we had to take reading tests on the computer.In seventh and eighth grade we had to sit around the room and take a book and read it for part of the hour	8
11862	3615	We also a challenge in middle school to see which school could read the most	9
11863	3615	That was part of our grade in our english class	10
11864	3615	It was never a problem for me because i loved to read.Now there are some books that libraries should take off the shelves	11
11865	3615	For example any book that involves nudity or lots of vilance	12
11866	3615	Now thats just for kids that are under the age of thirteen	13
11867	3615	Now there isn't that many of books out there for little kids to read	14
11868	3615	Theres more adult books than little kids books.All I have to say is that watch what your kids read	15
11869	3615	Don't keep them from reading books because that will effect them later on in life	16
11870	3615	If they don't like to read persuade them to try it	17
11871	3615	I also think that more kids would read if they seen their relatives reading too	18
11872	3615	Just remember kids and adults of all ages reading is a good thing no matter what you decide to read.	19
11873	3616	In this persuasive essay i'm going to write about why or why not offensive material should be banned from library shelfs, and there are a couple reasons that are going to help me do that	0
11874	3616	I think that we should'nt take anything off the shelfs in libraries	1
11875	3616	My first main point why we should not take any material off the shelfs in libraries is that there are some material that people might find offensive that others do not and are getting affected by those who do want these material off the shelfs	2
11876	3616	I think that some of the movies and books that is taken off the shelfs should be material that some kids should experience that @MONTH1 help them in the future	3
11877	3616	My second main point is that if we do take all of the offensive material off the shelfs there would only be movies and books like bambi and scooby-doo, because all the material that are in libraries are offensive to people in some ways different than others	4
11878	3616	I have not found a movie or book in any library yet that I have found offensive	5
11879	3616	Also if we do, we might as well not even have a library, because there would only be about @NUM1 movies and books in the whole building, because of all of the offensive material that people could find in cd's, books, and movies	6
11880	3616	People hear cuss words probably everyday, whether its at school or home	7
11881	3616	So all of the words and actions in movies are not as bad as people in real life saying them	8
11882	3616	I just think of every movie and book as just a movie and book	9
11883	3616	Scary movies are not real and some books too	10
11884	3616	There is sex and other inapropriate things in movies, but thats also why you have to be a certain age to even get the movies	11
11885	3616	To summarize up what I was just talking about in the last couple paragraphs, I think that we should not take any thing off the shelfs in libraries, beacuse it will hurt others, and theres just no need in it	12
11886	3617	When I walk into a library to look for a book, I would love to do so without seeing inappropriate books, movies, or magazines	0
11887	3617	When I see that, I  think, '@CAPS1 if a child saw this?' I would like a library for my child to visist without me worrying about the things they could see.To fix this problem, the libraries could do a number of things	1
11888	3617	First off, the libraries could censor @CAPS1 they put out on the selves	2
11889	3617	By putting the adult books section by the check out place, an employee at the library could easily find any small children wandering into that section	3
11890	3617	If that soultion does not work, then try and rate the sections like we rate movies	4
11891	3617	Put @CAPS2 books and movies together, @CAPS2- @DATE1 books and movies together, @CAPS4- @CAPS5 books and movies together, and so on	5
11892	3617	One time, when I took my baby brother to the library, he decided to bring me an adult book with a nude woman on the cover and asked if he could check it out	6
11893	3617	I was shocked and embarrassed	7
11894	3617	I did not think that that kind of thing would happen at a public library, but it did	8
11895	3617	I believe that everyone should have the option of finding the book or movie of their choice	9
11896	3617	So I do not wish to have any inappropriate books or movies removed, but placed in better order so that children are not going to see that kind of stuff.	10
11897	3618	Should the librari be censord on the books it has on the shelvs	0
11898	3618	I think it should be	1
11899	3618	There are many offensive books and thangs on the shelvs	2
11900	3618	I wouldnt want my kid or anybody els kid reading offensive books	3
11901	3618	So lets get rid of all the bad stuff or atleast filtyer it all	4
11902	3618	I beleve any book, movie and magazines that have alot of profanity or bad pictures in them should be removed or not be able to be cheked out to a certion age	5
11903	3618	If they wana keep teh books on the shelves they should make it where you have to be in high school and have a permsion slip to get the books	6
11904	3618	Removing teh  books and thangs complitly @MONTH1 cause to much troubl so we should defntly make sure the kid is a certian age and has permsion	7
11905	3618	I would not want my @NUM1 year old kid read a book with bad language in it	8
11906	3618	Kids cach on to that stuff and they will start talking like that and it would not be a good thing	9
11907	3618	There is alot going on in socaty now a days that badly influnce children	10
11908	3618	They do not need to read about how guys rob places and are crimanals	11
11909	3618	I think thats why we have so much of a probly to day becouse evry one sees it at a young age and they want to be lyk that wehn tehy get older but that is a very bad thing	12
11910	3618	They do not need books and movies that make it worse on them and make them think bad things are good	13
11911	3618	If we do not filter wat they do at a young age they will end up being hellins and outa of countral becouse they will think just becouse someone in a book or movie did it that its ok for them to do it but its not	14
11912	3618	I would not wnat a young kid to read bad things	15
11913	3618	I say lets put a ge limit on them and mack our socity beeter and are kids to become beter adoults later on in ther life	16
11914	3618	We need to filter out the bad and put new in for our younger kids	17
11915	3618	If we don't who knows how theyl grow up to be the world could go to hell if we dont stop the kids from learning bad things	18
11916	3618	So lets get the fi,ltering satrted and save the world and our kids future.	19
11917	3619	Thoughts of @CAPS1    I feel as though offensive literary pieces should be able to be taken from libraries	0
11918	3619	If a piece of @CAPS1 is particularly offensive	1
11919	3619	the piece should not be displayed	2
11920	3619	From my own experience, controversy is the reason that books are stricken from libraries	3
11921	3619	All of my experience, observations, and reading have told me one thing	4
11922	3619	That one thing being, pieces of @CAPS1 are taken away because of their offensiveness	5
11923	3619	From the experience that I have had with books that cause controversy, I have noticed myself not liking the book	6
11924	3619	I believe that is the reason people do not like certain books in libraries	7
11925	3619	Coming from someone who does not particularly like reading	8
11926	3619	I feel as though reading something that offends me puts me in a state of mind as though I would not like to read any longer	9
11927	3619	All of my experiences seem to point to not reading books that cause distress or controversy	10
11928	3619	Of all that I have observed, I have found similar things as my experiences	11
11929	3619	I have seen people, classmates in particular, that do not desire to read because they feel that a novel has offended them	12
11930	3619	Though my observations @MONTH1 seem one-sided	13
11931	3619	I truly have observed more lack of reading due to controversy than the increasing of reading due to controversy	14
11932	3619	All of my observations seem to point to supporting the revocation of 'banned books'	15
11933	3619	The piece that I have noticed most prominent to this topic that I have read would most definetly be @CAPS2 @NUM1	16
11934	3619	In said novel society has outlawed all books	17
11935	3619	The story seems to heavily favor those who wish to read controversial novels, though we can take something from reading this book	18
11936	3619	The reading of this novel can be interpreted to favor my argument, as people lived happily without controversial books	19
11937	3619	Granted not all people did, but that is because of certain variables	20
11938	3619	From stories, such as the three little pig and the big bad wolf, we can understand how poorly the concept of controversiality is drawn	21
11939	3619	For instance, I was mortified hearing that the first time	22
11940	3619	I have never had the interest of hearing it again, as I felt that the story is not politically correct	23
11941	3619	Pieces of @CAPS1 are taken away because of their offensive properties	24
11942	3619	If someone has no interest in reading a book because of the thoughts maintained inside of the text	25
11943	3619	the book must be stripped from the public	26
11944	3619	As it would only make sense to try to keep the peace	27
11945	3619	I for one support the cause to remove books from public places due to controversiality.	28
11946	3620	People today always seem like they are trying to find something offensive	0
11947	3620	The problem with the @ORGANIZATION1 is that it always feels like it needs to appease these people	1
11948	3620	The truth is that when you have as many as there is in a country, there are going to be many different ideas, thoughts, likes, and dislikes	2
11949	3620	Libraries are places of knowledgee	3
11950	3620	They keep many differnt books, magazines, and movies there, so that people with all different tastes can enjoy the library	4
11951	3620	Most people, with books, figure out early what genre of books, which authors, and how long of books they like	5
11952	3620	So books are usually very hard to offend people, because most people can usually tell right away if they like the book or not	6
11953	3620	Magazines are like books in away	7
11954	3620	People know what they want	8
11955	3620	With magazines though, people ususally just flip threw the pages, and skim through articles	9
11956	3620	They will keep skiming through the magazine, until they find that perfect article they want to read	10
11957	3620	Usually after that, they are done with the magazine	11
11958	3620	Music has been around almost as long as mankind has been around	12
11959	3620	There is something about music that soothes the human body	13
11960	3620	Music is one of those things that ais constantly changing with time	14
11961	3620	Before instruments, music was just purely voice, but as the centuries went on, music became more advanced	15
11962	3620	Now it would be nice if there was just one type of music that everybody liked, but there isn't	16
11963	3620	There are so many types of genres of music, that it would be hard to find a person in this world that liked every type of music	17
11964	3620	There are people who hate change	18
11965	3620	Likewise thet don't like to change there favorite music types	19
11966	3620	But if people changed with time, then there would really only be a  few types of music	20
11967	3620	But since there are many types of music, there is always going to be someone out there in the world that doesn't think that song shouldn't be played	21
11968	3620	Just in the last century movies have came along way in advancement	22
11969	3620	Movies use to be simple, they would have a simple plot, and everyone loved it	23
11970	3620	But there are so many people who love to see technology advance, that they want movies to change	24
11971	3620	Movies today are all about special effects, love, sex, alcohol, parties, fighting, and the list could go on and on	25
11972	3620	Directores try to make the best movie possible, so its almost like they try to put just enough of one thing to keep the audience into the movie	26
11973	3620	But if they go overboard on a subject, that is when at least one person has a red flag go up in their head and think that is offensive	27
11974	3620	Movies are suppose to be enteraaning, not something people should get offended by	28
11975	3620	Movies are good about it though	29
11976	3620	They have created a rating system to try give the audience a fair warning heads up, so that the audience knows what to suspect in the movie	30
11977	3620	It doesn't matter what it is, book, magazine, music or movie, there is always going to be someone who doesn't like it or is just offended by it	31
11978	3620	There is nothing to do about that, and it's not a bad thing	32
11979	3620	It's just simply means everyone in this world is not the same	33
11980	3620	So I think we can all come up with the conclusion that: just because one person doesn't like something, doesn't mean the next person will	34
11981	3621	Should books and such be removed off of the shelves if they are found offensive	0
11982	3621	Personally I don't think they should be	1
11983	3621	If @CAPS3 is something in the book that is remotelly offensive towards children then it should be put under a section for adults only	2
11984	3621	Most libraries I have been to have different areas for each age group	3
11985	3621	If @CAPS3 is a book that is racially unexceptable then it should be put in the adult section not anywhere for children	4
11986	3621	When a book is being questioned if it is offensive or not they should review all the possibilities of how someone @MONTH1 comprehend the story to see their reaction with it	5
11987	3621	@CAPS3 are many genres of books, music, magazines, etc., so @CAPS3 is always a place that the book can go to	6
11988	3621	Most of the questioning about a book is the language in it	7
11989	3621	For example, in @CAPS1 we just finished reading the book '@CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS3 is a lot of question if the book should be read in schools or not because of the 'n-word'	8
11990	3621	It is a very harsh word, but it goes with the setting and the background of the story	9
11991	3621	When someone is not sure if a book is acceptable or not they should take in concideration what the story is about and whether or not the word is needed or not	10
11992	3621	In many cases the unexceptable thing @MONTH1 work along with the story	11
11993	3621	If one book is being questioned about something wrong with it then shouldn't all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be questioned	12
11994	3621	If something is not allowed for one item then it shouldn't be allowed for something else	13
11995	3621	It is all about the audience who reads that certain book if it is appropriate or not to the person reading it	14
11996	3621	I have read many books that have certain words that don't bother me, but someone else who isn't use to it @MONTH1 not like	15
11997	3621	Some parents don't want their kids hearing foul language or inappropriate stuff from the type of music they listen to	16
11998	3621	It all comes down to who reads the book or magazine, and who listens to the music	17
11999	3621	Katherine Paterson makes a very good point about how if we start taking the books off of the shelves then eventually @CAPS3 wouldn't be any books left on the shelves anymore	18
12000	3621	Just becasue something has a bad word or phrase in it doesn't mean it needs to be taken away from peoples enjoyment!	19
12001	3622	If you have been a child with parents who cared, then you have heard them say, 'No you can't play that game, you can't listen to that music, or you can not watch that movie.' @CAPS1 you asked why you were not allowed the same answer was always givin, 'You're not old enough.' If you ever had the courage to ask why again they would most likely have said, '@CAPS2 if I wanted you to know then I would allow you to find out for yourself!', and that didn't get you anywhere now did it	0
12002	3622	Now I would like for you to think back on those things you were not allowed to do, and how now that you are old enough you can do those things	1
12003	3622	How would it change things if those movies, @CAPS3's, or games had been removed from the shelves before you had the chance to get to them	2
12004	3622	What would you and your friends have done if you didn't get to watch '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8' that night because some parent or other individual had had it removed from the market because they found it offensive	3
12005	3622	I would also like for you to think about the child you @MONTH1 have or @MONTH1 plan to have, would you want your child to be subjected to such things as '@DATE1 The @NUM1' or '@CAPS9 and @CAPS10' as a @NUM2 year old	4
12006	3622	Most likely that answer is 'no', but what if, because they were found offensive, they were simply removed from existence	5
12007	3622	Then they would never see them and to some that @MONTH1 be what's right, and for those of you who think that I have some news for you, those kind of movies are still made today	6
12008	3622	'@DATE1 The @NUM1' has been remade and is more graphic than before, and there are countless other titles that i could throw @CAPS6 you now that have some form of sexual themes, drug use, or foul language	7
12009	3622	They still exist and are becoming more and more popular among movies	8
12010	3622	There are @CAPS11 movies that will have some sort of sexual reference, a cigarette, or a bad word in them	9
12011	3622	You might be able to get rid of a few, but would probably never rid the shelves of all of them	10
12012	3622	But let's say that you did, that you were, in fact, able to throw away any title that contained these themes	11
12013	3622	What would there be left to watch	12
12014	3622	If those movies do not exist any more, then what would your kids have to be able to watch, @CAPS12 the @CAPS13 and @CAPS14-@CAPS15	13
12015	3622	Not only that, but what movies would you watch, if all movies with something offensive in them were removed then you wouldn't have anything left for yourself	14
12016	3622	Every thing that you might like and/or think is funny in a film, but don't want your child to see is gone	15
12017	3622	My answer to you is to not just throw everything out that @MONTH1 be offensive, or that you might not want your child to see	16
12018	3622	Instead of going to such drastic measures to shield your child from them, but to simply not allow them to watch those movies or listen to that music	17
12019	3622	It's what I'm sure your parents did you, and I know it's what mine do to me, and guess what	18
12020	3622	It has worked so far, so why should we change it?	19
12021	3623	I don't think that anything that gets checked out from the library should be censored	0
12022	3623	Some of the people that go to the library aren't looking for material with offensive language and/or themes	1
12023	3623	On the other hand, there are some people who go to the library who find that having offensive language spoken when it was meant to be is better than censoring it	2
12024	3623	Take for example a book about @PERSON1	3
12025	3623	It could have some things in it that people could find offensive	4
12026	3623	But if someone has to write a report on @PERSON1, it would be best to have as much information on him as possible	5
12027	3623	I will make one compromise: if there is music being checked out with offensive language, they should provide it with both a clean and explicit version of the album	6
12028	3623	There are ways that censorship can be good, and some ways that it could be bad	7
12029	3623	Some people find bad language and themes offensive, while others find that it gives freedom to the artist or author	8
12030	3623	I think that uncensoring things in the good and bad form is better than not uncensoring things at all	9
12031	3624	A kid walks into the library up town	0
12032	3624	He looks around and finds a movie one of his friends recommended to watch	1
12033	3624	He checks it out and goes home to watch the movie	2
12034	3624	Later on, his parents come home to see their son acting out of the ordinary	3
12035	3624	He starts to say rude comments, being violent, and using profanidity	4
12036	3624	Who is to blame	5
12037	3624	The friend who recommended the movie, or the library for having this movie on the shelves and letting the young kid check it out	6
12038	3624	Today, many libraries have a variety of books, movies, music, and magazines to choose from	7
12039	3624	Some libraries even have computers for kids, teenagers, and adults to use for certain things such as business, personal mail on websites, or games for kids to play	8
12040	3624	But are all the libraries meeting their requirements	9
12041	3624	Some people find many books, movies, music, magazines, and even websites threatning	10
12042	3624	Libraries have movies that are rated @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @NUM1, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4	11
12043	3624	They @MONTH1 also have music that has explicit lyrics on the @CAPS5	12
12044	3624	Some libraries @MONTH1 not meet their requirements and that is why libraries do not have as much business as others	13
12045	3624	In my opinion, I think that if a library has offensive material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and websites, they should be removed from the shelves	14
12046	3624	If the librarians are letting young kids check out explicit music, and @CAPS4 movies, they should possibly be fired	15
12047	3624	From my own experience, I have not had trouble with libraries and materials they have to choose from	16
12048	3624	I have not visited a library that has had explicit music to choose, all of the bad websites are blocked on the computers, and all of the magazines are appropriate for all ages	17
12049	3624	In conclusion, libraries should have respect not only for people, but for the materials they have	18
12050	3624	They need to show respect for the books, movies, music, and magazines they provide for kids, teenagers, and parents	19
12051	3624	Censorship is required for every library and I think that all the libraries around do meet their requirements.	20
12052	3625	Censorship at  the library is not needed at all times	0
12053	3625	It is the parents who should take the books away from the kids	1
12054	3625	It isn't the libraries job to tell people what to do	2
12055	3625	There are certin cases when it's needed though	3
12056	3625	It's the parent's job to tell the kids what to do	4
12057	3625	They are the ones in charge of the kids	5
12058	3625	they are the ones who should tell teach them right from wrong	6
12059	3625	They are the ones who are raising the kids, not the library	7
12060	3625	Other wise, they parents are having their job done for them	8
12061	3625	The libraries have the right to get what ever books they want as long as there isn't anything really bad in them	9
12062	3625	I do get it if they pull off books, movies, and magizines for adults, but if there is one little word in there, people will just have to get over it	10
12063	3625	Isn't that why people are wanting classic books, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2's @CAPS3' and 'The @CAPS4 of @ORGANIZATION1,' changed	11
12064	3625	Because black people find it offensive	12
12065	3625	It's not rignt	13
12066	3625	People are trying to rewrite history	14
12067	3625	to sugar-coat the truth	15
12068	3625	Well, the books are like the real world	16
12069	3625	People aren't always going to be nice to you	17
12070	3625	They can be down right mean some times	18
12071	3625	The whole world is just corupted	19
12072	3625	There shouldn't be a problem with just one little bad word in great works of liturature	20
12073	3625	People will cuss you out if they feel like it while in books, the language limited to one or two bad words	21
12074	3625	They shouldn't be trying to change great books because the minority find it offensive	22
12075	3625	The library shouldn't be the ones who tell us what we can and can not read	23
12076	3625	The library shouldn't censor their books.	24
12077	3626	The seven books which constitute the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series by @PERSON1 are books which are frequently censored in school libraries accross the country	0
12078	3626	The main reasoning behind this is that since these books portray witchcraft in a positive light, they must be harming our innocent children	1
12079	3626	Many books, from @PERSON2's 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series have been banned from school libraries due to their content being deemed inappropriate by a group of people who fail to take the larger meaning of these works into account	2
12080	3626	Works meant to be accessed by the public should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive	3
12081	3626	Under the @ORGANIZATION1 to the @CAPS7, every citizen has the freedom of speech, press and religion	4
12082	3626	By censoring the speech of authors, their rights have been denied	5
12083	3626	It is an author's right to say what he or she feels needs to be said, and it should not be up to a board of parents or directors to prohibit that right	6
12084	3626	By prohibiting books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to be read	7
12085	3626	the greater meaning of these works is being disregarded	8
12086	3626	Many conservative @CAPS12 groups have advocated that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' be banned from schools because of its portrayl of witchcraft (and therefore satanism) and the nominal fact that @PERSON3 has stated that @PERSON4 (the @CAPS15 in the series) is homosexual	9
12087	3626	However the ultimate message of the series is that love triumphs over evil	10
12088	3626	Apparently that is not a message worth teaching the youth of @LOCATION1	11
12089	3626	However, even if every school in the country took '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' off the shelves	12
12090	3626	that would not, and should not, stop children from reading these books	13
12091	3626	Since 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' began to be part of many schools' curriculum in the @DATE1, it has been at the top of the most censored book list due to its vulgar language and a chapter involving a prostitute	14
12092	3626	That has not stopped millions of teenagers from reading this novel, which is considered to be a rite of passage for most young adults	15
12093	3626	Being one of the most continuously challenged books over the last fifty years only seems to add to its allure and its popularity amongst the very people that these censorship boards are trying to 'protect'	16
12094	3626	If a parent, however, does not want his or her child to read such a novel	17
12095	3626	it should be left to the parent to censor what his or her child reads	18
12096	3626	But just because one parent does not want their child to read '@CAPS1 @CAPS2', does not mean that every child should be denied the opportunity to read it	19
12097	3626	Censorship should be a matter of the private, not public sphere	20
12098	3626	Books and other works should not be censored in libraries	21
12099	3626	In doing so	22
12100	3626	an author's freedom of speech is violated and the greater meaning of the work is disregarded	23
12101	3626	And while certain groups @MONTH1 advocate to protect the children of @LOCATION1 from these offensive works	24
12102	3626	the children will still find a way to access them	25
12103	3627	I belive that the view on censorship in libraries are fine as they are for many reasons	0
12104	3627	The main reasons that i belive censorship in libraries are fine are that almost everything in the library are for people to learn about weather they read it or watch a movie about it	1
12105	3627	Another reason is that if they took everything that was offecsive or unliked then there would be a lot less information for people to learn about in libraries	2
12106	3627	I agree with Katherine Paterson in her quote because it means that if we took away every book that someone found offensive then there would be no books left	3
12107	3627	Every person has different things that offend them and it would not be possible to remove everything from the library that offended someone	4
12108	3627	For example, if someone wanted to learn about a historic war from the past, but if someone was offended by the war because they lost a family member or friend to it, should the piece of writing be taken away	5
12109	3627	Libraries are a place that someone can go to, to learn about something	6
12110	3627	They hold a lot of information about many different subjects that people go to learn about even if it @MONTH1 be offensive to some people	7
12111	3627	If someone doesn't like something or finds it offensive then they should just leave it on the shelf and move on because someone else might learn something important from it	8
12112	3627	There are things in life that people need to be opened to or informed about even though they @MONTH1 not always be plesent	9
12113	3627	Libraries are the place that people get introduced to these things and if these things are removed then where will people go to be informed about this information	10
12114	3627	To sum it all up, yes there are things in libraries that some people @MONTH1 find offensive but other people @MONTH1 learn from it and it would be unfair to take this information away from everyone else	11
12115	3627	A library is a place to go to learn about different things and should alway have information on different subjects and topics	12
12116	3627	Many people have learned things from a library that have affected their lives and will keep learning more things as long as they are still opened to a wide source of information.	13
12117	3628	Censorship in Libraries      I believe that there should be censorship in libraries	0
12118	3628	In @DATE1's society there are many kids who are hurting and are getting into bad things	1
12119	3628	There are somethings kids just should not see	2
12120	3628	Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive	3
12121	3628	Censorship in libraries can steer kids in the right direction	4
12122	3628	Odds are, if a kid sees his role model on the front of a movie case smoking a cigarette, then that kid is probably going to become curious about smoking	5
12123	3628	This has happened to me before	6
12124	3628	I once saw this kid that I looked up to drinking, and I almost took up drinking myself, but because I had the right peers, I didn't	7
12125	3628	The point is that when kids see someone they look up to doing a certain thing, it has a great impact	8
12126	3628	If that movie case is sensored then that kid would never even think about smoking because of his role model	9
12127	3628	Every parent is worried about their kid getting into trouble with the law, right	10
12128	3628	Some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it	11
12129	3628	A kid will see this and then they will probably think it is cool and go out and do the same thing	12
12130	3628	I have seen plenty of movies that made me want to go out and do what they did in the movie	13
12131	3628	What if that thing they see in a movie is murder	14
12132	3628	It maybe crazy to think that a kid would go out and murder someone because he saw people do it in a movie, but it could happen	15
12133	3628	A couple years ago I can remember reading an article in the newspaper about a kid shooting his father in the head	16
12134	3628	This kid was only six years old, but he thought that playing with guns was safe because he saw them do it in the movies	17
12135	3628	Censorship can take some of the stress off of some parents' backs	18
12136	3628	Parents stress all the time about where their kids are, what they are doing, who they are with, and so on	19
12137	3628	If the library censors some of the music and movies that kids watch then his parents will not have to worry too much about him going off and doing bad things because he sees his peers do it	20
12138	3628	This makes parents feel good and confident in their child's life	21
12139	3628	Finally, offensive movies are actually offensive, whether this be to the kid himself, the parents, or the audience that the movie is targeting	22
12140	3628	Keeping offensive movies censored can relieve a lot of hate in a kid's life	23
12141	3628	I say this from experience	24
12142	3628	In movies we always see the smart kids getting picked on and it seems like the athletes get all of the attention	25
12143	3628	Well I am sort of considered that smart kid	26
12144	3628	I feel that, because of some of the movies my peers have watched, they find it okay to pick on me	27
12145	3628	This creates hate inside of their hearts, all because censorship was not used	28
12146	3628	In conclusion it has to be obvious that I feel censorship should be used in libraries	29
12147	3628	Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive	30
12148	3628	With censorship, all of these things can be accomplished	31
12149	3628	This is not only helpful to the kids, but the parents as well	32
12150	3628	In my experience, censorship is a good thing to have.	33
12151	3629	People from all over the world have many different opinions	0
12152	3629	If someone doesnt like something they do have the choice of not looking at it	1
12153	3629	Therefore, I believe that when you find something in a library that comes offencive to you you should not be able to remove it	2
12154	3629	One main reason why I feel that the offensive things shouldent be taken out of the libraries is because, not everyone @MONTH1 feel the book, movie, magizine, or music is offencive	3
12155	3629	People have their own opinions on everything, and if someone takes out a book or any thing in the library because they feel its bad, the other person is going to miss out on something they like to read	4
12156	3629	Another reason I feel the bad things shouldent be taken out of the library is because, some people could get mad at another person for taking all the offencive things out of the library	5
12157	3629	Many people like the offencive things in books, movies and soforth	6
12158	3629	I think from my own prospective that I like having a little bad in my life and if reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music, or even reading a magizine is what it takes I want to be able to go to a library and pick out something good with out haveing to worry if its there or not	7
12159	3629	In my own opinion, I believe that with out offencive remarks or words there wouldnt be any humor in books and stuff today	8
12160	3629	Just because the offencive things seem rude and unapproite doesn't mean that they are	9
12161	3629	It's just something said to make a book or anything interesting and funny	10
12162	3629	Although some offincive things in libraries can seem too unapproiate, I believe that if they're there then obviously there not too bad, and they shouldnt be taken out because one person feels that its not something that belongs in a library	11
12163	3629	Everyone has there own opinions in life and sometimes keeping them to yourself is the best thing to do.	12
12164	3630	There are numerous books and movies which are deemed not appropriate for younger audiences	0
12165	3630	By marking movies with a rating, and marking books with a specific age group, it helps categorize them	1
12166	3630	In our public libraries, all books and movies are settled into one place for everyone to have the ability to check out	2
12167	3630	There is the ongoing discussion on whether these should be available to everyone	3
12168	3630	If a child were to check out a book, and it happened to be rated @CAPS1, the parents would most likey become upset with the library for giving the right to the child to check out a rated @CAPS1 movie	4
12169	3630	There is also the instance where a parent would have the child check out a specific movie with a @CAPS1 rating	5
12170	3630	In which the library would be harrassed for not letting the child check it out	6
12171	3630	Furthurmore, should public libraries let certain age groups check out movies/books which are not appropriate	7
12172	3630	The logical answer concludes to no, they shouldn't	8
12173	3630	If a child can not see a rated @CAPS1 movie at the theatre, why should they be able to check them out freely at the library	9
12174	3630	Public libraries should invest in a way to keep underage kids from checking out inapropriate materials	10
12175	3630	By simply having their age on their library card, there would be a lot of misunderstandings taken care of	11
12176	3630	Our public libraries should take it into their own hands, by changing their censorship	12
12177	3630	It would give them a better name, and give our children a secure place to gain access to these matirials.	13
12178	3631	Wouldn't it be nice to walk into a library and be able to find any sort of book possible	0
12179	3631	I believe that it would be very useful and helpful for many libraries to allow a varied censorship of books	1
12180	3631	In my opinion it would be beneficial to students, parents, or teachers to get information on different topics	2
12181	3631	As well as many students who need to write a paper about a certain topic that they @MONTH1 not be familier with, and allowing all the types of books would help anybody with any topic	3
12182	3631	A library is a place where anyone can go to find information on something, find an interesting read, or just relax	4
12183	3631	If your going to get information on a topic that you know nothing about, it would be nice to find a book telling all about the topic	5
12184	3631	This would help students with reports, along with any other person who is trying to find some extra information they might not know about a topic	6
12185	3631	If a person was to not want a certain type of books in the library, then I think that person should just try and ignore the books	7
12186	3631	I think this because I dont think books should be taken out that are beneficial to others, just because it is offensive to someone that could just ignore it	8
12187	3631	Maybe the books are about drugs, sex, or violence, but they still are able to teach many people that aren't already knowledgable about the innappropriate, or offensive topics	9
12188	3631	In conclusion, throwing books out and keeping a library censored, would be a mistake	10
12189	3631	It is a mistake because it is taking away from many people who are wanting to become knowledgable about different topics	11
12190	3631	It takes away from people who need to learn about topics for things such as school, or even work	12
12191	3632	No, cause if that is the case evry  book you read could be offense to somebody	0
12192	3632	If they think the book is bad then don't read it.First off a book should not be banned from a libary.It is just a book.Second the only reason they would want to band a book is because people like to start drama	1
12193	3632	Third reason every could be offense to somebody	2
12194	3632	First off they should not band a book just because people don't like it.If your child read an adult book that is good for them, for reading those big words.And if they just happen to see a naked picture it is not the end of the world	3
12195	3632	I bet it is not the first and it won't be the last	4
12196	3632	Second some people would try to band a book just to start drama	5
12197	3632	They know it will cause a lot of crazy things with the author	6
12198	3632	Finaly If they band books for being offense then they would not have a libary	7
12199	3632	Cause any body says something is offense.In all they should not band one book.	8
12200	3633	In libraries there are certain materials on the shelves that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people.I have seen some of these materials in with my own eyes	0
12201	3633	But Should libraries take them off the shelves because of this matter	1
12202	3633	Thats the question	2
12203	3633	Some might find it offensive and others @MONTH1 not	3
12204	3633	It all depends on the person	4
12205	3633	Libraries cant please everyone	5
12206	3633	In my opinion libraries should not take these materials off the shelves, because a material that they take off the shelf could be a material that another person enjoys	6
12207	3633	Just because you dont take the material off the shelf doesn't mean that there aren't other solutions for those that think the materials should be tooken off the shelfs	7
12208	3633	Some solutions to fix this problem could be to take these 'offensive materials' and put them on taller shelves or in a room by thereselves so that children or people who do not like the idea dont have to see these certain materials.Then 'people who find it offensive' and 'people who dont' both get a side in this matter and it solves the solution to the problem	8
12209	3633	If this solution doesn't work there are many more	9
12210	3633	The librarie can take out the really offensive materials and replace them with others more suitable for all	10
12211	3633	Overall I do not think libraries should take out these materials	11
12212	3633	Just try to make people on the offensive and nonoffensive side both happy then there will be no more conclusions as in this one.	12
12213	3634	Yes  I do think that if material in a library is offensive that it should be taken out  the library because the libary is a place where people go and get a better understanding of something they dont know.Here is why I say this	0
12214	3634	If you go to a library and you see something that you dont like and you dont think it is apppraite for people to see then it should be taken  off the shelf	1
12215	3634	I wouldnt want anybody in a libary unsatistfied with the books, movies, music or anything else especially if childern are involed.People should be able to go to a public place where they are satistfied with the way they carry their place, also it should be suitable place for childern to come and learn.The libary is a learning enviorment where education, growth and devolopement should be inspired	2
12216	3634	My reason for saying all this is that a library should be a place where learning should be its number one goal and that if things in the libary are offensive to a person that it should be taken off the shelf	3
12217	3634	I know that childeren should be able to go to a liabrary and be satistfied on the way the libary is.	4
12218	3635	Should materials in libraries be censored	0
12219	3635	No, i dont think that stuff in libraries should be censored or taken off the shelf	1
12220	3635	If something is offensive to someone then that person doesnt need to look at that material	2
12221	3635	People should have the right to get whatever they want from the library and if someone doesnl't like the materials they have then thats too bad	3
12222	3635	What if kids get bad stuff off the shelf 	4
12223	3635	If a kid were to get something bad or innapropriate for themselevs the libraries wont let them check it out so it is fine, and the parents should be watching the kids get	5
12224	3635	I go to the library all the time and I have never seen anything thing that is innapropriate and i don't know anyone who has ever told me they have found something offensive in a library, because I think the libraries know what people want and what people dont want there	6
12225	3635	and it's not right to take something off the shelfs if a few people dont like it because im sure other people like it	7
12226	3635	But if there is something very offensive that everbody thinks is bad than you can remove but you can't remove material every single time someone complains it is offensive because then there probally wouldn't be anything left in the library	8
12227	3635	So I dont think anything should be removed from shelves just because some people find it offensive because im sure just as many people don't find it offensive and it would be wrong to take it from those people.	9
12228	3636	I believe that if there is a book in a library that a child is not allowed to read that the book should be some where the kid shouldnt be able to get it	0
12229	3636	I think those types of books should be stored in the part of the library were a child shouldn't have access to	1
12230	3636	Also the library should have a section to where only the certain age can read that book	2
12231	3636	In some libraires there are a bunch of books that are not made for a child to read and they have them to where a child can get access to them and that shouldnt be allowed	3
12232	3636	So i believe that they shouldn't allow children to get access to those types of books	4
12233	3636	The same thing applies in a store	5
12234	3636	In some stores they have a magazine section where there are bad stuff that a kid is not allowed to see	6
12235	3636	I know in the grocery store that i go to there are inaproperiate images and words that a child should see or read	7
12236	3636	So there should be an area inside that store that a certain age can access them because one day i was in the store and i saw a little kid reading a magazine and saying the bad words that were in it and looking at the bad pictures it also had in it	8
12237	3636	So that is the reason they should put the magazines in a place were children shouldn't get access to them	9
12238	3636	In the same store there is a music section and there are children in it all the time	10
12239	3636	The music is not all that bad its just that the kids can take these off the shelves and take it home and listen to it	11
12240	3636	This is the part that is the parents fault by buying the @CAPS1 for the child to listen to	12
12241	3636	So if the parent buys the child that @CAPS1 that is bad it is the parents fault	13
12242	3636	But i think that the @CAPS1's for little children should be in one part of the store and the @CAPS1's for the older people should be where the can get access to it	14
12243	3636	This same thing applies with movies	15
12244	3636	There are movies in stores that are rated from @CAPS5, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1@NUM1, @CAPS6, and even for @CAPS7 audiences only	16
12245	3636	In a bunch of the movies form @LOCATION1@NUM1 abd up have a bunch of stuff in them that a child should not see	17
12246	3636	Like in the @CAPS7 audiences only movies they show nudity and a lot more stuff that no one under @NUM3 shouldnt see but they have some of those just sitting on the shelves at stores	18
12247	3636	So children shouldn't be able to have access to those types of movies	19
12248	3636	The reason i explained all of this is so children dont get ahold of them	20
12249	3636	Like in the music if the kids start listening to some bad music they will start saying those bad words and get in trouble at school and anywere else	21
12250	3636	Even if the chid reads a book that has bad stuff in it they will start saying those words or even do the stuff that happens in the book	22
12251	3636	In the movies that a child is not suppost to see like a gory action movie or a movie that shows nudity or even a movie that cuses that child will see that movie and will show there friends or get ideas form the movie	23
12252	3636	And these are the reasons why a child shouldn't be allowed to get access to this kind of stuff.	24
12253	3637	Should we have the right to be able to remove materials from shelves if they are found offensive	0
12254	3637	I believe that we should not have the right to be able to do this	1
12255	3637	I believe that if we had the right there would be no materials left for future children to read	2
12256	3637	A big thing to consider when you think about this right, is even though our materials speak of discrimination, or use a word that someone might find offensive, or even if we did not like the book, movie or magazine and thought that it was a waist of space	3
12257	3637	We should never have the right to be able to remove these materials	4
12258	3637	I know of several people that think the harmless childs first book is trying to discriminate someone, or a race of people	5
12259	3637	There are books out there that are discriminating certain races of people, or informing us of a time when people were discriminated against	6
12260	3637	If we would have the right to remove these materials, all of them would eventualy be gone	7
12261	3637	Our future children wouldnt know that the event even happened or if they did half of their information would more than likely be wrong, since over years people would probably change the story to a version that they wanted their child to think	8
12262	3637	If someone found one single word in the book or even a movie that they thought was offensive then they would have the right to remove the material from another persons view	9
12263	3637	If someone found a curse word in the material that they found offensive, or if they just find the idea of using curse words offensive they would be able have the material removed and that would mean that thousands of good books and movies would disappear for a word that one person did not like	10
12264	3637	Some people might find them to be a waist of space and just remove it, if they did not like the book, movie, music or magazine	11
12265	3637	There are some people out there that like to read or listen to them and @MONTH1 find some of the them that we cant stand to look at, good or entertaining	12
12266	3637	Some people do not like a book by its size or by how big or small the words are	13
12267	3637	These arent ways to judge a book	14
12268	3637	I think that nobody should have the right to remove a book, movie, music, or magazine from the shelf	15
12269	3637	We all should keep these materials as a reference to future generations	16
12270	3637	Past people in the world have destroyed materials that they didnt like, now we will never know what they were about or even trying to tell us	17
12271	3637	There is no reason to remove a material just for the oppinion of one person or even the oppinion a a group of people.	18
12272	3638	Removing certain materials from the shelves of libraries is not the way to go	0
12273	3638	No matter how offensive they might be, there are many other ways to solve this problem	1
12274	3638	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from libraries for being too offensive	2
12275	3638	First off, many people have different opinions about what is offensive and what is not	3
12276	3638	For example, many people have different intrests than others	4
12277	3638	Some people @MONTH1 like certain kinds of books and movies while others @MONTH1 not	5
12278	3638	For instance, one of my favorite types of movies to watch is a comedy	6
12279	3638	On the other hand, there are many friends of mine that love to watch horror movies	7
12280	3638	This is something you can not change	8
12281	3638	Everyone is going to have their own preference on what they want to read, listen to, or watch	9
12282	3638	Why would you take things away that people actually enjoy	10
12283	3638	There are other ways to solve this problem	11
12284	3638	I believe that we can solve this problem by just seperating certain materials from others in the library	12
12285	3638	For example, if something is thought to be offensive, then it can be placed with others like it	13
12286	3638	These materials do not have to be removed completely	14
12287	3638	Mothers are often worried about their children picking up things in the library that they think are offensive	15
12288	3638	If these materials are seperated from others, there will not be a problem	16
12289	3638	Certain materials do not have to be removed completly from a library	17
12290	3638	All in all, there is no need to remove materials from a library because many people have different interests	18
12291	3638	In conclusion, I believe that materials should not be removed from libraries for being to offensive	19
12292	3639	I'm really sick and my head really hurts at this moment while having to write this paper, so please take @CAPS1 easy on me	0
12293	3639	Any source of literature is someone's own creation of imaginiation, taken in whatever direction they so choose for @CAPS1 be to be taken	1
12294	3639	The creation of that art form as writing would be nothing less then lonesome trash floating the winding streets if @CAPS1 were censored	2
12295	3639	@CAPS1 is almost like when watching television	3
12296	3639	your kids are up and want to stay up late to watch the new horror movie but no way, that movie is way to scary for them, plus @CAPS1 shows some nudity	4
12297	3639	If the movie is not appropriate for your children then do not let them watch @CAPS1	5
12298	3639	In a library though, your mother might not always be there to pre-read your books for you	6
12299	3639	So maybe you just have to assume responsibility and read the book if you choose to, or not read the book depending on how your mother would feel about @CAPS1 of course	7
12300	3639	The thought of there being censorship in libraries is quite ridiculous	8
12301	3639	Of course I would not like to see @PERSON1: @CAPS1 in my childrens section but that is all up to just having books in their right sections	9
12302	3639	Have the explicit books on one side of the library and the non on the other side	10
12303	3639	The main point is that most people that make use of the library are old enough to choose a book of their liking and if they are not they have their mother accompanying them	11
12304	3640	There are many different types of books, music, movies, magazines,ect., that fill the shelves of libraries and stores across the country	0
12305	3640	Consumers are constanly taking these items off the shelves without realizing what they are really buying	1
12306	3640	Some parents @MONTH1 not even realize what their teenagers or little children are actually buying	2
12307	3640	Some of the material @MONTH1 be offensive and have a bad influence on those who buy into them	3
12308	3640	But if parents were more careful about what their children buy then there would not be a problem	4
12309	3640	That is why these materials should remain on the shelves	5
12310	3640	One vital reason these items should not be taken away is because it is the consumers choice on whether or not they want to buy or check out these items	6
12311	3640	People should be able to decide for themselves on what they will or will not buy	7
12312	3640	If they do not want to buy or check these materials out then then they should just go to another shelf, or shop at another store	8
12313	3640	I have seen some parents who do not really care what their children buy, and I have also seen parents go the other way	9
12314	3640	If stores take away these items that it is almost like taking away their right to make a choice	10
12315	3640	It is the adult's responsibility if they do not want their children to watch movies that are for mature viewers	11
12316	3640	The parent should be able to prohibit certain things until their child is old enough to make its own decisions	12
12317	3640	If they trust their children with these materials then that is their choice	13
12318	3640	These offensive items can not just be taken off the shelves just because some people are bothered by them	14
12319	3640	With the way the media works, it would be difficult to remove all these items from libraries and stores	15
12320	3640	No matter what there will probably always be a way for younger children to be exposed to these materials	16
12321	3640	On television there is always commercials that will attract kids or teens and influence them to but their stuff	17
12322	3640	I have also seen music videos and magazines with their favorite celebrities on the covers	18
12323	3640	It is almost impossible to control every aspect of society to make it appropriate to younger viewers	19
12324	3640	If all the people were able to take all the items that they did not approve of off the shelves, then there would be many of these shelves left empty and bare	20
12325	3640	If everyone were to take a book they did not like off the shelf then there would be a little selection at the libraries	21
12326	3640	By taking off one of these books, someone could be taking off another persons favorite book	22
12327	3640	People can not just take books off the shelves because they have some bad language	23
12328	3640	There is a reason for separating the children's section from the adult's section, and it is because some books might not be appropriate for all readers	24
12329	3640	From my personal experience I have not seen any problems with kids checking out offensive books	25
12330	3640	Most little kids are attracted to the children's section because of the colorful pages and simpler words	26
12331	3640	There is a variety of materials available to the public that @MONTH1 be offensive to some, especially to their little children	27
12332	3640	As a parent it is their responsibility to keep track of what their children are being shown	28
12333	3640	People can not take materials off the shelves because it is only offensive to some	29
12334	3640	This would not be fair to those who enjoy these kind of materials	30
12335	3640	If they do not want to buy it then they should simply move on to another shelf or to a completely different store	31
12336	3640	It is their choice as the consumer on whether or not they want to buy into the many different types of books, music, movies, magazines, ect.	32
12337	3642	Dear @CAPS1 paper,     I for one do think that certain books should be removed from the book shelves at the libraries, but I also disagree with that same situation as well	0
12338	3642	For example, I believe that certain books shoud be removed from the library shelves because, under age children also attend the library, and because, other people might find certain books offensive and should not be displaed in a library	1
12339	3642	My disagreement to the situation is that the its a library, and libraries have different types of books	2
12340	3642	First, I think that certain books should be removed from the library because, it a public library and not only adults attend that library, but under age children as well	3
12341	3642	I know that certain books under age children are not allowed to check out, but they are not deprivcd of their privlliages of staying in the library reading such books	4
12342	3642	Next, I do not agree that cerain books should be viewed on library shelves because, other people might find such a book offensive to be in a library	5
12343	3642	The reson I say this is because some books oppose humor to other people race, and if for say a black, mexican, maybe even a arbiana person was to come in the library looking for a book and happen to fall upon a book that talks about their race, most people would take that offensive	6
12344	3642	However, I do not think that any book being deprived from a libray	7
12345	3642	My reason for thinking that is simply because its a library, and libraries are developed for many peole types of intrest in books	8
12346	3642	And I don't think it will be fair that certain books should be removed from the library because people think they are inappropraite in certain people interest in books	9
12347	3642	And people should be free to come in and look at books without having to search for books that interest them but are removed because other people find them offensive	10
12348	3642	Therefore, I do and also don't agree that a library should be stripped of a book becuase it lacks intrest in someone or offend someone	11
12349	3642	And that such a person should 'put the shoe on the other foot' as the saying goes and try to see from other people point of view.	12
12350	3644	Censorship in libraries is kind of a big deal in schools	0
12351	3644	There @MONTH1 be  a book that someone really wants to read, and they cannot get it in their school's library	1
12352	3644	A lot of books that are great educational books have been taken off of the shelves of libraries, because they are either too violent, or they have bad language in them	2
12353	3644	If kids or parents are offended by these types of books, then they do not need to check them out	3
12354	3644	There should not be censorship on books in schools	4
12355	3644	There have been a lot of books, teachers view as being educational books, that have been taken off of the shelves in libraries	5
12356	3644	Books that teachers would like to give to there class to read	6
12357	3644	There should not be any problem with giving someone a book that has a few bad word, or a few violent scenes for them to read	7
12358	3644	Some of the books that are banned could relate to someone, and touch them	8
12359	3644	Banning books in libraries needs to change	9
12360	3644	People should have the right to read what they want to read, even if the book or magazine comes from a school library	10
12361	3644	There are books that are very good that have been banned	11
12362	3644	'@CAPS1 for @PERSON1' for example was banned in public schools for some reason	12
12363	3644	This book is one of my top five favorite books, and i could not check it out of the library because it was banned	13
12364	3644	This kind of stuff needs to be open to everybody no matter the age	14
12365	3644	Censorship in libraries is something that needs to go away for good	15
12366	3644	Many peoples lives could be changed, touched, moved, etc..	16
12367	3644	due to a book	17
12368	3644	Many books that have been banned are great books that can have an effect on someones life	18
12369	3644	People should be able to read what they want to read when and where they want to read it.	19
12370	3645	I think certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because the word is just saying 'OFFENSIVE', or those things should be placed where not everybody can get it, like the little kids or when your religion doesn't accept that kind of things	0
12371	3645	For example in my opinion there are some books, music, movies or magazines that show images or words that are offensive, and not just for me or other people too	1
12372	3645	Offensive for me is when its not an appropriate thing like certain images, videos or bad words that should not be use  for everybody to hear or see	2
12373	3645	You have to be careful when you think something is offensive because not everyone thinks like you, and everybody has a different opinion and conclusion and we have to remember, we have the power to talk, read and write what we think is best	3
12374	3645	I'm not saying that they should prohibit certain books or music, I'm just saying that there is time for everything and we are young and we are looking for a good future, not just for us also for the younger kids and the older people have to provide us the best they can, because they have experience and they know what is best for their kids	4
12375	3645	This is a free country and people should express their opinion and make it worth, if you think something is being bad say it, and its important to remember do not let people offend you with words or images and don't let them force you to do something offensive for someone else	5
12376	3646	In @DATE1's world there are so many things around our children that if we tried to take materials away, we would be take most of what is made for entertainment	0
12377	3646	Many adults say that our world has changed so much from the time when they were younger	1
12378	3646	Well, why don't we do something about it	2
12379	3646	People need to stop complaining about everything and just do something	3
12380	3646	Adults can eliminate the amount of materials the children take home with them	4
12381	3646	If you were to walk into any store these days you would find something that you would not want your children to watch, see, or listen to	5
12382	3646	I believe people are doing the best they can to seperate these materials from the family oriented materials	6
12383	3646	Sometimes it is just not enough, children are still getting addicted to some materials at a very early age	7
12384	3646	These children share what they have with their friends, and these other children start doing the same things	8
12385	3646	Many materials such as movies and music have negative ideas that teach children things they do not need to know or learn	9
12386	3646	The material that talks about drugs, parties, and drinking does not even need to be on a radio station or a television channel that a young child would listen to	10
12387	3646	Our adults need to also learn that it is not good for the children to learn and listen to these things, and to keep their children away from it as much as possible	11
12388	3646	Like the author said if everyone was able to take something off of the shelves there would not be anything left	12
12389	3646	We are always going to have these things that we do not want children to see, but we can start to eliminate some of them	13
12390	3646	The others we can not eliminate we can continue to keep on the shelves and other places, but just kept where children don't go	14
12391	3646	I believe that our towns and cities can do a better job of keeping our children away from @CAPS1 rated movies, negative songs, and different books that talk about 'adult things.' The children are the future of the world	15
12392	3646	If that's all they are watching and thinking about then it does not look good for the future	16
12393	3646	There are many things we can do to stop our children from watching, listening, and learning about these negative things in life	17
12394	3646	Keep the children away from these materials, it will be a better world if we do.	18
12395	3647	There are many books, music, movies, and magazines that people find offensive	0
12396	3647	Some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves	1
12397	3647	I do not believe that the books, music, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelves completely	2
12398	3647	Not everyone finds these things offensive and they should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them	3
12399	3647	First, people have different views on what they find offensive	4
12400	3647	Not everyone will find the same things offensive or want the same books or song to be removed	5
12401	3647	With people always having different views it is difficult to take books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves for everyone	6
12402	3647	Just because one person does not agree with what is being said in the movie or book does not mean that every single person wants that movie or book to be removed	7
12403	3647	If one person found my favorite book offensive I would not want it taken off the shelves completely	8
12404	3647	Equally important, if every book, song, movie, and magazine that someone finds offensive is taken off the shelve there would not be many books, movies, songs, or magazines left	9
12405	3647	Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove a book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	10
12406	3647	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if every single book that offends someone is taken off the shelves there would be no books for anyone to read	11
12407	3647	People find different things offensive and if everyone took these things off the shelves there would be none left for anyone	12
12408	3647	Finally, if someone finds a book offensive they do not have to read it	13
12409	3647	When someone finds a book, movie, song, or magazine offensive they don't need to watch it or read it	14
12410	3647	Instead of taking it off the shelves the person could just not read it	15
12411	3647	Not everyone finds the same books offensive and taking them off the shelves could upset many people	16
12412	3647	When someone finds something offensive they could just avoid that instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people	17
12413	3647	If someone was offened by one of my favorite books, I would prefere if they just avoid reading it instead if taking it off the shelves so that I can not read it	18
12414	3647	Some people find many books, songs, movies, and magazines offensive	19
12415	3647	They would like these things to be removed from the shelves permenatly	20
12416	3647	I, however, do not believe that these things should be removed	21
12417	3647	Taking these off the shelves could make some people happy, it could also upset even more	22
12418	3647	Not everyone finds the same things offensive and should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them	23
12419	3648	Imagine walking out of your home and you see right down the street a giant bonfire, right in the open	0
12420	3648	You see men walking into a library empty handed and walk out carrying armfuls of books, magazines, movies, and other media	1
12421	3648	The men then toss them into the raging inferno and you seem them become incinerated, lost forever	2
12422	3648	This is what will happen if we let censorship of our libraries take place	3
12423	3648	We should not let censorship of our libraries take place since it violates a constitutional right, will gradually make our society more and more ignorant, and will let this nation slide from a democratic nation to one where the beliefs and ideals of the people are controlled by a small group of people	4
12424	3648	Letting censorship of our libraries take place will violate a basic constitutional right, plain and simple	5
12425	3648	In the @ORGANIZATION1 it clearly says that there will be freedom of the press	6
12426	3648	By tossing out certain literary works this right will be thrown to the side and by violating one constitutional right, what will come next	7
12427	3648	Will our freedom of speech be negated, or our freedom to assemble	8
12428	3648	As citizens of the @LOCATION1 we can not let this happen to our great nation	9
12429	3648	By allowing certain books and essays to be thrown out of our libraries, the people's knowledge base will eventually shrink down drastically	10
12430	3648	For example take @PERSON1's theory of evolution, a very sensitive subject among people of the @CAPS1 faith	11
12431	3648	If all of his works regarding that were to be thrown out, much information that was very valuable to biologists would be lost and those biologists would not be able to improve upon the existing pool of information	12
12432	3648	If this was to take place our civilization would experience a lessening intellect and a expanding ignorance regarding many fields of knowledge	13
12433	3648	Picture @CAPS2 in the @DATE1	14
12434	3648	Hitler's @ORGANIZATION2 has taken power and our systematically destroying all materials they find to be subversive to the @ORGANIZATION2 cause, only allowing materials that contained beliefs and ideals that they thought were correct to exist in libraries	15
12435	3648	This is exactly what we would be doing if we allowed censorship of our libraries to take place	16
12436	3648	The censoring of the libraries would be controlled by a relatively small group of people which means that the censoring would be controlled by that same people's beliefs and ideals, and those same beliefs and ideals would thus  be forced upon the people, shaping the beliefs and ideals of the masses to those select few	17
12437	3648	In conclusion, letting censorship take place in our public libraries will dismantle the basic structure of our society by violating a constitutional right, making our society gradually become more and more ignorant, and letting the beliefs and ideals of our people rest in the hands of a select few	18
12438	3648	This is not what our @CAPS3 @CAPS4 envisioned @LOCATION2 to become and they were right	19
12439	3648	Letting censorship exist in our public libraries is simply wrong	20
12440	3649	Everyone has things that would offend them, whether they admit it or not	0
12441	3649	Books are known to do this to people	1
12442	3649	However, there are all different kinds of books, music, and all the other materials that could offend all different kinds of people	2
12443	3649	There are even books read in school classrooms that offend people	3
12444	3649	Reading is an important thing and whether or not the reader likes it, they will come across one that offends them	4
12445	3649	I believe we have the right to have those offending things because there are so many books who offend people, music and movies have censorship, and if they don't like it they should ignore it	5
12446	3649	First of all, we have the right to have these kinds of books	6
12447	3649	Just like in life, there are certain things people don't like, but deal with it anyway	7
12448	3649	That's what this is	8
12449	3649	Even though there are the handful out there that don't like those certain books, those books are the ones that are well liked and become famous	9
12450	3649	I have read a book that people have wanted to ban and it was one of the best books I have read	10
12451	3649	To sum that all up, if we took away every book that one person didn't like, there would be only few left	11
12452	3649	Secondly,  music and movies have censorship	12
12453	3649	You can choose whether you want that censorship or not	13
12454	3649	Movies tell what ages are okay to watch those movies	14
12455	3649	Music blocks out the words that need to be	15
12456	3649	If they don't want it they don't have to listen to it or watch it	16
12457	3649	We all have the certain things we love and hate, we can't eliminate all of the hated things	17
12458	3649	Last of all, in my opinion if they don't want it they don't have to have it	18
12459	3649	The music and movies are an option to people, they don't have to listen or watch something they think is a bad idea	19
12460	3649	It's all opinionated, there isn't a right or wrong to it	20
12461	3649	I know of people out there who don't have @CAPS1's or they don't listen to the radio, that's perfectly fine	21
12462	3649	They don't have to complain about because they don't pay any attention to it	22
12463	3649	To wrap this all up, there are so many books out in the world that offend people, the music and movies have censorship, and if they can't stand it they don't have to deal with it	23
12464	3649	As I said, these books, magazines, music, etc	24
12465	3649	are very well liked by many of people, so why get rid of them for those few who get offended	25
12466	3649	We all have things we do and don't like that we cannot do anything about	26
12467	3649	As Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	27
12468	3649	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'	28
12469	3650	There I was, shuffling my way through the library, finding the perfect books to check out	0
12470	3650	It was then that I had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting	1
12471	3650	The cover page featured a depressed girl with the look of hope plastered on her face and the back included the summary of a book I wanted to get my hands on	2
12472	3650	The book, titled @CAPS1, was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it	3
12473	3650	Stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves, it is then our job to discover them	4
12474	3650	Whether literature includes stories of love and breakbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on our library shelves	5
12475	3650	Opinion, everyone has one that conflicts with someone elses	6
12476	3650	Our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas, should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides	7
12477	3650	Literature is an escape for many people, it is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading	8
12478	3650	If we remove books that @MONTH1 be offensive to one, we are taking away that opportunity for others	9
12479	3650	In my opinion, the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries, is sheltering our world	10
12480	3650	Regardless of how hard we try, children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives	11
12481	3650	We should not attempt to hide what our actual world is like, rather allow them to experience it in a safe way, like reading or listening to music	12
12482	3650	If someone views material as offensive, it should be the parent's responsibility to regulate whether their child reads or listen to it or not	13
12483	3650	The removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help	14
12484	3650	In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from our libraries, rather regulated through our parents or elders	15
12485	3650	The idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective	16
12486	3650	If any material has the potential of being offensive, it is not the library's role to regulate whether or not it is displayed to the public	17
12487	3651	The censorship in a library should be kept the same as it is already	0
12488	3651	A few reason explain why the censorship is alright as it is	1
12489	3651	Those reason are That the parents should be in charge of the books their children read, that not all people agree on censorship, and that the libraries have books of different subjects that people like to read	2
12490	3651	The first reason is that parents shoud be in charge of what their children read	3
12491	3651	If the parents would just tell their children no to a certain book, then the child will not read it	4
12492	3651	If the parent does not want their child to go into a section then, the parents can just say keep away from that area	5
12493	3651	Although, sometimes the child @MONTH1 stray away from its parents it is not very likely that the parent will not notice	6
12494	3651	That is why the parents should be in charge of what their children read	7
12495	3651	The second reason is that not all people agree on censorship	8
12496	3651	Certain people think that religion is important no matter what the book shows, but others would think parts of religious book (nudity, swears, etc...) is extremely innapropriate	9
12497	3651	Some people would say that books like @CAPS1 mythology books are innapropriate and need to be censored, although others think these books are past culture and that they should remain in the libraries forever	10
12498	3651	Most children will look at these books and think that the books are to big to read, so they would not even look at them	11
12499	3651	Few people would agree on censorships, and a lot of people would disagree	12
12500	3651	The third reason is that libraries have different subjects than the innapropriate books	13
12501	3651	The people can look at a different book and completely ignore the others	14
12502	3651	It is not like a child will go up to the dirtiest book they can find and say '@CAPS2 I want to read that one.' the child will probably want something that relates to a television show or a movie of some sort	15
12503	3651	The point being that a person can read other books than just innapropriate books	16
12504	3651	Library books should be kept the same because the parents should be in charge of what their children read, not all people agree on censorship, and libraries have different subjects that people want to read	17
12505	3651	The censorship should be fine according to some people other would disagree	18
12506	3651	The children probably would not look at the innapropriate book anyways, because they would not interest the child.	19
12507	3652	So you see a nice, old lady looking at one of many books throught a library, she chucks @CAPS4	0
12508	3652	You look at her, she looks at you, she walks away	1
12509	3652	You go and pick up the book, @CAPS4's about medical marijuana	2
12510	3652	She took offense to that	3
12511	3652	I don't really care what people gotta say, if @CAPS4's on the shelf, @CAPS4 stays on the shelf	4
12512	3652	I'm convincing librarians, readers, and everyone else that if you have offense to a book, magazine, movie, or anything you can find at a @CAPS1 library, shut your fat mouths	5
12513	3652	A library serves many purposes, one, @CAPS4's @CAPS1, itt's open to anyone and everyone	6
12514	3652	Two, if you have a library card, you can check out books, movies, music, etc	7
12515	3652	Three, if your walking down the road and 'gotta go,' you can stop right in and leave	8
12516	3652	What I'm trying to say is that nothing should be removed from any shelf at any library	9
12517	3652	Yeah, I mean there's a certain point at which you got to take charge, but even then you can have an adolescent room or what not	10
12518	3652	I think that if you take something off the shelf at a library, you can just taking away part of the heart	11
12519	3652	Let's say you have @NUM1 @CAPS1 libraries in your town, one library has one thing the other doesn't have	12
12520	3652	Someone riots and they get to take @CAPS4 off the shelf	13
12521	3652	Your never going to find that anywhere else unless you buy @CAPS4 off line	14
12522	3652	And sometimes, that can get a little pricey, especially since you can get @CAPS4 free at a library	15
12523	3652	But then again, I see where people are coming from to take certain materials off the shelfs	16
12524	3652	Say you gotta @NUM2-year old kid, and he walks up to you carrying a sex love book	17
12525	3652	What can you say about that	18
12526	3652	I mean in sounds corny but @CAPS4 can happen	19
12527	3652	Most parents just want to keep their kids in a safe, harmless enviroment	20
12528	3652	That's where they come in and say, 'I thought this was a @CAPS1 library?!' Then that's where @CAPS4 goes bad	21
12529	3652	After all that happens, people just accuse the librarians to @CAPS2 they got these books, movies, and music that's just bad for a young kid	22
12530	3652	But @CAPS4's not the librarians' fault, different people like different books, that's @CAPS2 a library has many, many choices when @CAPS4 comes to books	23
12531	3652	That's when the question comes up, '@CAPS2 don't we just have seperate rooms, for seperate books?' @CAPS3, that sounds good and all, but who's gonna pay for @CAPS4	24
12532	3652	Libraries get donated alot of their stuff, they are profitable, but then again a non-profitable resource	25
12533	3652	Libraries have been around for ages, most of them started out small and now are big	26
12534	3652	That's when the library gets donations, looks through them, and sells the books they don't want or need	27
12535	3652	They make money off that, that's when they start making seperate rooms	28
12536	3652	@CAPS4 sounds crazy, but @CAPS4 wouldn't cause a riot to go on about people	29
12537	3652	Therefore, people are happy, librarians happy, and most of all you are happy	30
12538	3652	You can find the book you want or need easy as one, two, three	31
12539	3652	All you gotta do is go to that certain room, look for @CAPS4, check @CAPS4 out and you got a nice book to be reading anytime	32
12540	3652	@CAPS4 sounds easier that looking @CAPS4 up, get the dewy decimal number, find the number	33
12541	3652	All in all, we shouldn't remove anything from a library shelf bevause @CAPS4 @MONTH1 be the only one in your town, maybe the only one in your state, maybe through the whole country	34
12542	3652	You never know	35
12543	3652	All I gotta say is, '@CAPS4's better to keep a book, than to forget a book.	36
12544	3653	Maybe, to a sense I do not think that boo'ks should be removed to an extent	0
12545	3653	The reason for this is becasue that some books, magazine and other stuff can be informative	1
12546	3653	They can help you wtih certain questions	2
12547	3653	They @MONTH1 not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have	3
12548	3653	But, there is also other reasons things that can be offense to others	4
12549	3653	People @MONTH1 take that aspect to the next level to where they are getting hurt	5
12550	3653	I think that maybe certain books and magazines should be removed	6
12551	3653	They tend to do damage to others and can hurt other poeple	7
12552	3653	The sense of this nautre is to ask the store to remove the books or magazine	8
12553	3653	The store can not take the books off the shelf if one person is offended by the book	9
12554	3653	If you take every offensive book of the the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives	10
12555	3653	They maybe think it would be a good idea to books off the shelf but younger adults could not learn the mature items that the parents do not want to terach	11
12556	3653	They @MONTH1 think they are doing t the right thinking by not showing you sexual offenive stuff	12
12557	3653	You @MONTH1 not want kids or others to see this sexuality and see what the world is becoming	13
12558	3653	Also, I can see why they would want to take that stuff off the shelves	14
12559	3653	They @MONTH1 not like what they see but they think it is the truth and is very offensive to see the sexual, mental illness people have	15
12560	3653	Certain books @MONTH1 stay on the shelf such as a @CAPS1 book	16
12561	3653	@CAPS1 books so the human body they do not hid the human body we should know about the human body	17
12562	3653	So the @CAPS1 books and magazines should stay on the shelf	18
12563	3653	If you want to look at naked provakadive stuff then go to a sex store	19
12564	3653	Do not put out books in public that can show the sexually side of humanbeings	20
12565	3653	The @CAPS1 magazines are there to learn not for enjoyment	21
12566	3653	You can go to a different store for enjoyment	22
12567	3653	But, if you take off stuff that can be offensive to others then that means you would have to take off the @CAPS1 items	23
12568	3653	People could get offenive by not looking like the poeple in the magazine	24
12569	3653	That could offend them so would you take it off the shelf or not	25
12570	3653	Not you would not becasue a @CAPS1 book is there for you learning envoirment not to ofen you	26
12571	3653	That also could go for the sexual magaizes	27
12572	3653	Yes, sex is good for you but would you want to teach that to ounger kids that fast	28
12573	3653	You would want to teach them about sexual introcourse not a magazine	29
12574	3653	I know that @CAPS1 books and tapes can be incouraging sex but they are mainly talking to adults	30
12575	3653	As far as music and tapes go no I do not think that those types should be removed	31
12576	3653	That is for enjoyment and people liek to relax to this sorta stuff	32
12577	3653	I mean I do not buy tapes of @CAPS2's or music but othe people do	33
12578	3653	They enjoy it if you did take it off then what else would they put up	34
12579	3653	You have to think about the younger generations	35
12580	3653	The older generations lived a happy not violent life	36
12581	3653	But, for teenagers now in certain places they have it hard	37
12582	3653	They need to make a living on the street	38
12583	3653	They need something to listen to	39
12584	3653	This offensive music is to listen sure some music is horrible but what music isnt these days	40
12585	3653	If music is what you are instersed in then why would we take it off the shelves	41
12586	3653	People make a living listeing to music and cerating it for others	42
12587	3653	It is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around	43
12588	3653	Making stores and stands take the music and newspapers off would be a disappointment to see such a wonderful thing go down the hole because it hurt others	44
12589	3653	If you go back to the @NUM1's there music was about drugs as well and nobody ever had a problem about that	45
12590	3653	Maybe people don't have a problem with it but its becaseu they grew up around it	46
12591	3653	Just like we have grown up to the rap and the sexual musice	47
12592	3653	We are teenagers and you were once a teenager	48
12593	3653	You know you would not be listeing to a beetles song that wouod not be about drugs or sex or getting high	49
12594	3653	The beetles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now	50
12595	3653	Generations change and so does the enivorment but  you can not change they way we grew up	51
12596	3653	You can try to make it better but it will take a lot of will power	52
12597	3653	The generations now are tough and they wont let down	53
12598	3653	You might as well stop trying to take down what we grew up to away from us	54
12599	3653	Nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours	55
12600	3653	Its not something you want to take away it's somthing you want to look back and see how much are generations have changed from one to another	56
12601	3654	In my opinion I believe all types of material should be allowed in libraries	0
12602	3654	If someone takes offense to a particular topic or section they dont have to read it	1
12603	3654	Not just certain types of genre and themes or magazines	2
12604	3654	Everyones different meaning they have differents personalities and views on what they like	3
12605	3654	I think libraries such actually expand thier variety of books	4
12606	3654	Libraries that don't cater to a persons desires or interests , what would make them want to stay	5
12607	3654	Libraries should be filled with all sorts of subjects appealing to everyone	6
12608	3654	Just like how they have an adult and children section	7
12609	3654	Everyone has a place were that feel like they belong	8
12610	3654	Even if some people get offended	9
12611	3654	A person can get offended anywhere not just by a certain magazine or some music style	10
12612	3654	I do believe if there is a certain line of respect of course	11
12613	3654	Nothing should get to out of line were it's an issue with a numerous amount of consumers complaining about the same topic	12
12614	3654	You can tell if a certain section or material is crossing the line	13
12615	3654	Each section should be written to speak the truth but also in a respectful manner	14
12616	3654	In the times that I've been to the library there @MONTH1 be some things that I don't agree with how certain things are certain ways	15
12617	3654	But then I see a person really enjoying their time at the library	16
12618	3654	I know when I go I always find  my style of music that appeals to me	17
12619	3654	Not just the same thing everywhere I go	18
12620	3654	Theres always a choices, different options and more things I can learn about	19
12621	3654	Keeping all the materials like books, music, movies, etc is a way to appeal for everyone	20
12622	3654	I person should have their opinion and the choice to be able to read what they like	21
12623	3654	There will always be a certain movie or book you don't care for ,but others might	22
12624	3654	If everyone told what they like and don't like about a  certain book	23
12625	3654	Where's the variety	24
12626	3654	What books will be left	25
12627	3654	Everyone has their on thoughts on what they like, if theres a topic you don't like you probably know least about it	26
12628	3654	And the library is a good way to search and find information about anything	27
12629	3655	This essay is all about wether certain materials in libraries should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to some	0
12630	3655	I do not believe things should  be removed from shelves in libraries if they offened someone	1
12631	3655	Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't mean its offensive to all 	2
12632	3655	If you are offeneded by somethings they display there are ways that you can avoid seeing them	3
12633	3655	One thing you can do to avoid it is never go by or around the shelves displaying it , ask for help so you get whatever it is that you need , or try to search what your looking for on the internet	4
12634	3655	When i visit the library I already know what im going to get so i have never found anything offensive to me	5
12635	3655	If I did find something offensive to me I would complain and if they didnt do anything about it I would just never go back	6
12636	3655	I would just research online or go to another library where I know they will meet my needs	7
12637	3655	The libraries I go to always have sections seperating the different age groups	8
12638	3655	The sections are split into children , teens , and adults 	9
12639	3655	I' ve been to the library numerous times and I have never heard anyone with a complaint about something being offensive	10
12640	3655	If the library had something that would offense me I wouldn't know	11
12641	3655	Everytime I go I stay in one paticular section for teens and look at magazines and books 	12
12642	3655	I feel that if people are offended by what they see on the shelves they should just avoid or ignore it because everyone has their own opinion on what offends them and what doesn't	13
12643	3657	I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue	0
12644	3657	While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said	1
12645	3657	When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves	2
12646	3657	The possibility children will see the offensve material appears unlikely	3
12647	3657	Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the childrens books	4
12648	3657	At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place	5
12649	3657	To acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be @NUM1 years of age	6
12650	3657	It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question	7
12651	3657	Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated	8
12652	3657	@PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time	9
12653	3657	Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written @NUM2 years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards	10
12654	3657	While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries	11
12655	3657	For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves	12
12656	3657	If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them	13
12657	3657	When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves	14
12658	3657	When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned	15
12659	3657	Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today	16
12660	3657	I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue	17
12661	3657	If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored	18
12662	3657	When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned	19
12663	3657	With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed.	20
12664	3658	Have you ever been at the library and asked yourselve any of the following questions	0
12665	3658	Who reads this	1
12666	3658	Why is it here	2
12667	3658	Are kids reading or watching this stuff	3
12668	3658	Do kids check these out	4
12669	3658	Or have you ever wondered or said to your self any of these statements	5
12670	3658	I don't want my kids to pick this up and read this	6
12671	3658	This is so offensive	7
12672	3658	This goes against all our morals	8
12673	3658	I don't know what kind of freak convention this is but I'm no part of it	9
12674	3658	Lets get out of here	10
12675	3658	This place is wack	11
12676	3658	Ever consider what books get banned from the library	12
12677	3658	Who bans the books	13
12678	3658	I think things should have to be very offensive to pull them off the shelves	14
12679	3658	I think that they should just stick them to a side of the library and put a age on it or you have to be a certain age to check out those books	15
12680	3658	I dont think the cussing books are that offensive	16
12681	3658	When the person (No matter who it is)goes out into the world	17
12682	3658	They are going to learn and hear curse words	18
12683	3658	People use them like they do the words 'and' or 'the'	19
12684	3658	They are going to hear them till thier grave	20
12685	3658	Wheather they chose to use them or not that's thier choice	21
12686	3658	For them to be banned or moved to a diffrent group of books they should have to be sexist, raciest, have alot of sex, or just really grusome	22
12687	3658	I think they should go upstairs with the mushy romance and wacked out western	23
12688	3658	I mean people could go up there and check them out but that is the adult library area	24
12689	3658	The staircase should be by the circulation desk	25
12690	3658	When they are not busy they should go upstairs and check and see if there are any young children up there	26
12691	3658	I think The top level or a certain area should be the adult area	27
12692	3658	They have mushy lovey dovey stuff, they have cow boy shoot off stuff, and the offensive stuff	28
12693	3658	The stuff with too much sex, really raciest, or really sexist, or grusome stuff like people killing people for fun.Also they should have the adult magazines up there too	29
12694	3658	Don't act like you don't know what im talking about	30
12695	3658	You know how you go down a aisl at the @CAPS1 market and there are girls in thier bikini and half naked	31
12696	3658	Then there are the cosomos both should be upstairs	32
12697	3658	I mean they talk about how to give pleasureable sex	33
12698	3658	I would hate for some little @NUM1 year old or @NUM2 year old to pick that thing up she would be scarred for life	34
12699	3658	Then the main level or area should be teen books	35
12700	3658	You know vampire books, @CAPS1 heros, crazy fiction stuff, and then the magazines and movies that aren't bad	36
12701	3658	Then the bottom level should be the children level	37
12702	3658	Games puppets and movies and easy books	38
12703	3658	That about sums that up	39
12704	3658	I dont think just anybody should be able too ban a book	40
12705	3658	I think it should be open but not just anyone	41
12706	3658	There should be a huge meeting	42
12707	3658	With the mayor, a couple teachers one english teacher from each level, and parents, and the librabiens	43
12708	3658	The person who wants in banned should have to tell everyone why and stuff	44
12709	3658	Like Author Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	45
12710	3658	But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have the exact same right and so does everyone else	46
12711	3658	And then we have no books left for any of us.	47
12712	3659	Censorship in the libraries	0
12713	3659	Do you think that we should be able to take movies, magizens, and books off the shelf	1
12714	3659	There are many different arguments about this subject	2
12715	3659	I believe if they put the books, movies, and other stuff on the shelf than it should be able to be read by children and others	3
12716	3659	They need tho learn about everything thats out there in this world	4
12717	3659	because if they don't learn about this now than they will never know about all of this when they get older	5
12718	3659	I think that it is cridical for our youth to know about it	6
12719	3659	Some people @MONTH1 say that we are two young to be looking at that stuff but the younger you find out about it the better of you will be when you get older	7
12720	3659	So that is my input on the situation	8
12721	3659	the younger you are you can learn more about the stuff	9
12722	3660	I think that certain materails should not be removed because a couple people do not like what is in a book, or movie, or in music	0
12723	3660	If we where to listin to what everyone said and remove the books that they do not like then other people would not have anything to read	1
12724	3660	For example if a man came in a library and asked the library to remove a book that is about murdering and has violence in it	2
12725	3660	A person that @MONTH1 come in the library daily @MONTH1 want to read that book because that is the type of books that the man likes	3
12726	3660	Another example is if a person has children that come into the library and there children were watching movies about gangs,drugs,and violence, the mother would want that movie removed from the library	4
12727	3660	I say that if the mother does not want her children to watch the movies they do she should say something to them and punish them every time they are cought watching it	5
12728	3660	Instead of parents trying to remove the books that many other people like they should be more disciplined with there children.A way for the library to stop children from geting movies or books they should not be reading is to put all the books and movies in a special area where it will be watched	6
12729	3660	Many people like movies with drugs, and violence	7
12730	3660	There type of movies or books should not be removed because of what another person thinks about that certian thing	8
12731	3660	I also think that if a person does not like the type of language or images in a book or movie then they should not read it or watch it	9
12732	3660	And if they say there children watch it or read it without there permission then that is there fault and they should know more about what there young children are doing instead of trying to get that book, movie removed sometimes books and movies have very offensive languge but that is because they are just trying to show some of the stuff that happens in the real world	10
12733	3660	They want the movie or book to be as real as posssible.	11
12734	3661	Censorship	0
12735	3661	the aspect of removing offensive materials from the public eye	1
12736	3661	Is this the right thing to do	2
12737	3661	Should society as a whole take away variety	3
12738	3661	Do you believe our generation or future generations should not get to experience and understand what the past generations have	4
12739	3661	I believe censorship is wrong in every aspect, but I also believe that materials that are offensive, or unappropiate for certain ages can be controlled	5
12740	3661	Movie theatres, video stores, @ORGANIZATION1, and television all do it	6
12741	3661	They use ratings and age control for their viewers	7
12742	3661	Now control can be difficult, and @MONTH1 not always work if not handled correctly	8
12743	3661	To handle this situation before it arises, the library can use a system like restaraunts or bars use	9
12744	3661	such as, checking identification before letting a book that is '@CAPS1' rated or above be checked out	10
12745	3661	Different sections in the library can be available to certain age groups	11
12746	3661	Now you @MONTH1 be thinking	12
12747	3661	doesn't this idea take away from the liberties that libraries give us	13
12748	3661	Well you @MONTH1 be right, but you would rather have our children see violence and other inappropiate materials that they shouldn't	14
12749	3661	It would be just like the movie theatre	15
12750	3661	You would not need to buy a ticket, but the control of content would be phenomial compared to what it is	16
12751	3661	Would you want your six year old girl picking up an adult violence movie, sexual content movies, or even a @CAPS2 with cursing in it	17
12752	3661	Why should the library offer things for children that parents would frown upon	18
12753	3661	I believe the library should be a place of learning and freedom, but the learning should be something age appropiate	19
12754	3661	Our society is maturing too fast for young children, why should the library take part in that	20
12755	3661	Libraries located in schools do not even offer this material because they know that the majority of the readers' for their library are students	21
12756	3661	This being said why should public libraries be okay with stocking this material	22
12757	3661	Yes, media is everywhere	23
12758	3661	Movies, books, magazines, newspapers, music, and much more flash and sell more than they should	24
12759	3661	Media shows children things they shouldn't know about until they are young adults, but does this make it okay	25
12760	3661	Does it make is right for children to see and want all they want to	26
12761	3661	No, it does not	27
12762	3661	Fighting fire with fire only makes a larger fire	28
12763	3661	Why start our children out at a young age with violence, sex, and inappropiate material	29
12764	3661	Would you like to set your children up to fail	30
12765	3661	I know I wouldn't so why let our libraries hand out books, magazines, movies, and more to let our children thrive upon the culture they are stuck with	31
12766	3661	I do not think we should remove these books from our libraries because everyone has a different opinion, but I do believe that control needs to be put into place for our children's and other children's sacks	32
12767	3661	With that being said, censorship is overrated, but some of the material at the library are underrated, and that needs to be handled and controlled	33
12768	3662	Everyone has a favorite book	0
12769	3662	And some of us can't put it down once we read the first sentence	1
12770	3662	Then days later, the library takes it down and states that it's offensive to many people that have read it	2
12771	3662	Why should multiple people lose a good read just because someone doesn't like what they see	3
12772	3662	We're all trying to accomadate to everyone and their needs just to please them	4
12773	3662	Whatever they ask is done because we don't want a big scene	5
12774	3662	A majority of people think, 'That book is offensive	6
12775	3662	Take it down	7
12776	3662	Disgusting!'	8
12777	3662	But why	9
12778	3662	Everyone has a right to read what they want to read	10
12779	3662	No library should uphold to the needs of a minority about an 'offensive' book just because they say it's inappropriate	11
12780	3662	Who are we to judge what's good for everyone and what's not	12
12781	3662	Books are written for a reason, and that's to share the ideas of the author, not to corrupt society with their 'evil' and 'offensive' ideas that could potentially cause a child to rebel	13
12782	3662	That excuse is ridiculous	14
12783	3662	A parent should've taught their child to differentiate between right and wrong, and if they use the '@CAPS1 child will become a rebel if they read this!' excuse, then they're not confident in their childs capability, or the fact that they taught their child well	15
12784	3662	Also, it's not just the readers getting angry, it's the author	16
12785	3662	How bad would someone feel if they spent a year or two on a fantastic book, just to have it banned from library after library	17
12786	3662	Probably angry or upset	18
12787	3662	Authors have the right to write whatever they want	19
12788	3662	If they wish to talk about dragons and princesses, so be it	20
12789	3662	If they want to discuss why we see a full moon when we do	21
12790	3662	Go right ahead	22
12791	3662	No one can stop great books from being made and they certainly shouldn't be able to stop people from reading it	23
12792	3662	If someone is offended by a book, then don't read it, simple as that	24
12793	3662	Parents like to protect their children from harms way and bring them up as fine citizens of @LOCATION1	25
12794	3662	By having this desire, the parents do every little thing to make sure their son or daughter doesn't see, hear, or read anything inappropriate or 'bad'	26
12795	3662	This is just ridiculous	27
12796	3662	Controlling a childs life will just cause them to rebel more and more as they get older	28
12797	3662	Let children have a choice in what book they read, or the movie they watch	29
12798	3662	Parents need to teach their children right from wrong, and in doing so, letting them see, hear, or read whatever they want should be no problem	30
12799	3662	Without books, movies, and music, what would the world be like today	31
12800	3662	No one knows	32
12801	3662	Books are a great source of information, letting the author express themself as well	33
12802	3662	Movies are almost just as harmless, limits are needed, but overall	34
12803	3662	There should be no problem	35
12804	3662	Also, music allows the artist to bring out their side of creativity and emotion	36
12805	3662	Allowing that music, or movie, or book to be made, and then take it away is ridiculous	37
12806	3662	If it offends someone, then that person should just forget it, instead of taking it away from the people who love it and the person who made it.	38
12807	3664	To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3:     I am writing to you today concerning cencorship in libraries	0
12808	3664	I have had a select few instances throughout my life where I have read a book or magazine that to some @MONTH1 seem offensive and to others not at all	1
12809	3664	However, I do have my own view point on the situation and I feel that @CAPS2 is my duty to inform you that I feel offensive books, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves	2
12810	3664	Everyone has grown up and been taught different values and morals that are important to them	3
12811	3664	They stand for these values, but at the same time respect that other people have the right to believe differently than they do	4
12812	3664	With the world the way @CAPS2 is now, violence can errupt from the simplest of things	5
12813	3664	Putting books on public shelves for the public to read, can very easily cause outbursts and debates between people who have opposite opinions	6
12814	3664	Offensive books and magazines put out for the public is asking for something bad to be a result	7
12815	3664	My suggestion to you is to remove these offensive books	8
12816	3664	This will create a safe and happy envioronment for all who visit public libraries,and other public places	9
12817	3664	@CAPS2 will create fewer arguments between adults and set an example for younger children who are observing their parents behaviors	10
12818	3664	Children follow in their parents' footsteps	11
12819	3664	Observing bad behaviors from the parents due to offensive books does not teach the child how to act in a responsible way if they were put in this postion	12
12820	3664	When our children grow up, we want them to beahve in a responsible way	13
12821	3664	Offensive books not being put on shelves will hopefully create a healthful environment for appropriate behavior	14
12822	3664	As a student, I want to grow up in a world that has people who are resepectful, happy, and responsible	15
12823	3664	I want people to get along with each other	16
12824	3664	I feel that taking offensive books off shelves will help with this somewhat peaceful world I would like to live in	17
12825	3664	Violence can be created through anything, and I feel that offensive books should be the last thing added to that	18
12826	3664	Without offensive books for the public to read, will create a better environment for the people living today.	19
12827	3665	Removal of Books      If there is a book that someone takes offensive, should every book similar to that book be taken of shelves?No, even though people @MONTH1 find things in books offensive, they should not remove the books off shelves	0
12828	3665	When i was in the sixth grade my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'	1
12829	3665	I searched the whole library for the book then finally decided to ask for help, the privilage to read the book has been taking away	2
12830	3665	The book was no longer allowed in elementry schools, due to the fact parents were seeing what their children were reading and found the book very offensive	3
12831	3665	After many reports about the book, the book was taken out of the library	4
12832	3665	For me to do as my teacher asked i had to go to a public library and get the book	5
12833	3665	If you find a book offensive keep @CAPS3 to yourself and dont read the book, they shouldnt be able to remove books just because of what people think of them	6
12834	3665	Many people love different types of books, no matter if they are offensive or not others @MONTH1 like them	7
12835	3665	I believe that everyone has a right to read anything they want, books are made to be read and looked at	8
12836	3665	If books are being taking away then very less books will be read	9
12837	3665	But the more books read and understood, more books will be wrote and published	10
12838	3665	The same has to do with music, movies, magazines, ect, they all are made for a reason and should be checked out	11
12839	3665	@CAPS3 is great to learn about different things by reading, listening, reveiwing, ect, even the things people @MONTH1 find offensive, they @MONTH1 teach lessons.	12
12840	3666	Going to the library you would think of it as an family environment, wouldn't you	0
12841	3666	I know that when I think of the library I do not think or offenceive material that would make anyone upset	1
12842	3666	Surprisingly many of the libraries do and I do not think that they should be alouded to, since it is not aimed just for adults	2
12843	3666	Children loved to go to the library to check out books and many more things that they  enjoy, but a five year old does not need to see a movie, a book, or anything else for that matter descrimanting against the other gender or another race	3
12844	3666	These materials should not be able to sit apon the shelves no matter what the writers say if they are putting someone down	4
12845	3666	The writers or the library owners wouldn't let there own children read it so why should it be okay for someone else child to read or watch it	5
12846	3666	I'm not the only one who thinks this, I am sure that there are millions of people like me that would not appericiate their loved ones finding these things and reading them	6
12847	3666	The information that young ones see or hear while they are still young will carry on with them throughout their life	7
12848	3666	who knows what they will do or think when there are old enough	8
12849	3666	Theses places are supposed to be an family place where you can go to get information not for someone to pick up on violence, drugs, racistism, and any other diragotori subjects	9
12850	3666	Young kids are not the only ones that should not be reading these cruptied material	10
12851	3666	teenagers and adults are more likely to understand it better and take the subjects into account	11
12852	3666	I am begging these library owners to please take these offensive materials out of their branches	12
12853	3666	not only because small children could see them, but adults does not need to be reading, listening, or watching these things either	13
12854	3666	If you would not want oyur child to why would anyone else want their child too?	14
12855	3668	Libraries are great for multiple reasons	0
12856	3668	A library is the place to go if you need to do research, meet with a tudor, find an interesting book to read, find that one song you've been looking for, or pick out a new movie to rent for tonight	1
12857	3668	However within a library there are limits toward what they offer and what you can get	2
12858	3668	Censorship in libraries is a topic that comes up every now and then, and people will debate over whether they think censorship is a good or bad thing to have	3
12859	3668	Personally, I think that censorship can just be more unconvienient for some	4
12860	3668	For example, when I was in the ninth grade I was assigned to do a research paper over @ORGANIZATION1's	5
12861	3668	However this topic turned out to be a challenge to research because the libraries I went to did not offer many books or resources over @ORGANIZATION1's because it is seen as an 'inapropriate' or 'offensive' topic	6
12862	3668	Also, the librarians wouldn'@CAPS1 let me check out some of the books because of my age	7
12863	3668	Since they thought that I was too young to be reading that information, they weren'@CAPS1 going to let me proceed with my research	8
12864	3668	I think that if it's something going on in the world we live in, then it might as well be available for the public to access	9
12865	3668	If there are people who wish to not see or hear about certain topics, then they can take it upon themsleves to avoid it	10
12866	3668	Rather than just getting rid of it all together	11
12867	3668	The same goes for any form of media	12
12868	3668	If there is a @CAPS1.V	13
12869	3668	show that you don'@CAPS1 like, don'@CAPS1 watch it	14
12870	3668	If there is a song that you dislike, then don'@CAPS1 listen to it	15
12871	3668	It is that easy	16
12872	3668	I know I do it all the time	17
12873	3668	People need to take it upon themselves and understand what they can and cannot handle, and then apply that to their daily lives	18
12874	3668	When it comes to children, and censoring certain topics from them, I think that it is up to the guardians of the child to determine what is @CAPS2.K	19
12875	3668	and not @CAPS2.K	20
12876	3668	for them to see or hear	21
12877	3668	Then it is the responsibility of the guardians to make sure that their rules, or guidlines, are set and the child understands what they are	22
12878	3668	In conclusion, I think the purpose of a library is to offer information	23
12879	3668	Any information	24
12880	3668	Then people go to that library to find the information that they are looking for, with the wide selection the library has to offer	25
12881	3668	I think that libraries should'nt have to feel responsible for censoring items that @MONTH1 be offensive	26
12882	3668	It is their job to just offer information	27
12883	3669	I do not think books should be censored from the shelves of library's	0
12884	3669	Katherine is correct in many ways	1
12885	3669	We would not have any books if everyone removed the ones the disliked	2
12886	3669	The world would lose alot of information on important things in their worlds	3
12887	3669	I'm writing this to explain why I don't think books should be censored	4
12888	3669	I don't think book's should be removed if they are offensive to some people because they, sometimes, help people see the errors in their ways like a book about gloryfiying the way white men and women treated @CAPS1 @CAPS2 men and women	5
12889	3669	now a days people would read that book and if they were racist they wouldn't be after that book,because they see how wrong @CAPS7 is	6
12890	3669	Music is freedom of speech, some artist's see themselves as 'liberaters', 'idol's',and even 'love spreading',yes their are some songs that could be 'seem' offensive but you'll never know how high a @CAPS3 will grow if u cut @CAPS7 down In example the song titled '@CAPS4' by @CAPS5 @CAPS6,@CAPS7 has catholic churches furious because they automaticly assume she's disrespecting @CAPS8 when in reality she's speaking a whole different tone	7
12891	3669	People learn special, powerful  life leasons from things or situations that are shunned by our society and @CAPS7 will probably always remane that way,we don't know.But one thing we do know is we can change what we do in the present and better what were going to do in the future.	8
12892	3671	Should books, movies, magazines etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	0
12893	3671	No, because all you have to do is ignore it or not pay any attention to it and it shouldn't bother you that much	1
12894	3671	Most people might look at something and think it is interesting like something that happened on the news lately and was published on newspapers or put on the internet	2
12895	3671	For example, the @LOCATION1 story, that has been on the news for the past week, people think that it is awesome that he is was finally found and killed	3
12896	3671	If people found that offensive that might be because they don't know what he did or wasn't around when it happened	4
12897	3671	If they took down stuff that was offensive then we would have nothing interesting to read	5
12898	3671	If someone found a movie that was racist the don't get it, just put it back and find something else like a romance or a comedy	6
12899	3671	Everybody could use a laugh every once and a while	7
12900	3671	For music if your friend recommends something to you, check it out on the internet first to see if it is any good, if not then tell them no and that you find it offensive	8
12901	3671	If they were a true friend then they would understand and perhaps make it up to you with something else	9
12902	3671	Magazines, from what I know don't really have anything offensive in them	10
12903	3671	The only thing the have a some pictures, gossip, facts, and some stories that might peak your interest	11
12904	3671	Books might have something things that you find offensive but, if you like the book so much you might as well finish it	12
12905	3671	If you found a book that you really like then read through it a bit or check it out on the internet to see what is about	13
12906	3671	Out of all the books I have read, I have found none of them offensive they were all good books, books that i would probably read again if I wanted to, but I won't, because I'm lazy	14
12907	3671	Newspapers are interesting to read and might have little to none offensive remarks in them	15
12908	3671	Some might pertain to blacks or mexicans, something like that	16
12909	3671	Well I haven't read any like that yet but, I have heard somethings about it	17
12910	3671	In the newspapers there might be little comics or gags that would probably be more offensive than anything in the newspapers	18
12911	3671	I think that if you find something offensive then just ignore it and move on to something else instead  of throwing a fit about it because that wouldn't do well at all.	19
12912	3672	There are so many things these days that people find offending, in so many different places in magazins, books, movies, cell phones, on the internet,even some words in songs	0
12913	3672	Some people find it so offending that they think they should be able to remove these offending materials off the self	1
12914	3672	A big thing for parents in this situation is what if my child gets ahold of this	2
12915	3672	I dont want them reading this	3
12916	3672	What if it messes up their childhood	4
12917	3672	Honestly parents if you dont want your young child to read these things or see these pictures then why take them too these places where it is at	5
12918	3672	On the occasion that they do get ahold of it, then sit down with them and talk to them about it so they understand that its something they should not be ossiated with	6
12919	3672	Also if  evryone took things off the self what they found unoppropiate then we wouldent have anything left to read, listen to, or watch	7
12920	3672	Alot of times one thing that someone finds funny could offend another person to no end	8
12921	3672	For example @PERSON1 could find something very enjoyable, but @PERSON2 could find the very same the extreamly offending	9
12922	3672	It would lead to many arguments amoung or communites	10
12923	3672	Yet there is still another reason that this would not work out well, and would not be a good idea	11
12924	3672	If this were to happen then kids would grow up thinking that this is a esay world	12
12925	3672	This world is harsh and not easy at all times	13
12926	3672	Kids learn alot of this through the media	14
12927	3672	As long as we have postive role modles to exsplain to kids that what they see in some of the media is wrong, and they should not take part in it, then why would it need to be removed	15
12928	3672	If people were able to do this then the communities would have alot more crime from anger, we would have nothing left to read watch or see, and kids would live a very confused life not knowing what to exspect from the media	16
12929	3672	So now i ask you, what do you think	17
12930	3674	The content of a library should be full of various material even if one @MONTH1 find certain materials offensive	0
12931	3674	Just because someone @MONTH1 think a material is offensive does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgeting it altogether	1
12932	3674	Some subjects @MONTH1 be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ingnore them	2
12933	3674	One subject that @MONTH1 be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases	3
12934	3674	You often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about, but when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases they just walk on by, to uncomfortable to be seen in the area	4
12935	3674	It's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it	5
12936	3674	There are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware even if you think it doesn't effect you	6
12937	3674	Another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history	7
12938	3674	Some history @MONTH1 be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forgot about them	8
12939	3674	The @CAPS1 for example	9
12940	3674	That was a very dark period in history	10
12941	3674	Over six million people died becasuse just one person didn't like what they believed in	11
12942	3674	It's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is	12
12943	3674	We should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening	13
12944	3674	People's likes in music vary	14
12945	3674	There are so many different types and styles of music	15
12946	3674	Some music @MONTH1 be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library	16
12947	3674	The library should always have a large variety of different music	17
12948	3674	Often people would like to widen there music intellect and the library is the perfect place to do that	18
12949	3674	Everyone is different	19
12950	3674	We never all like the same thing	20
12951	3674	Taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information	21
12952	3674	If people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library they would most likely find another way to get that information	22
12953	3674	Having a vary in books, music, movies, and magazines make what the library is, a place to learn new things, no matter the subject.	23
12954	3675	Your watching a movie on tv that you and your friend have seen in theatres	0
12955	3675	You both love the movie and just as it gets close to the best part, the tv skips over that part because people think that that sceen is inapropiate	1
12956	3675	Censorship is good, but sometimes it is too strick when it comes to movies, music, and books	2
12957	3675	Some of the movies that are popular will end up on tv for the viewers entertainment, @CAPS1 some movies have sceens that are a little inapropriate, and even though it's not that offensive, the tv compaies will cut that sceen out of it	3
12958	3675	Also, if there is bad language in the movie, they will take that word out and replace it with another word that makes no sense with what the movie is trying to say	4
12959	3675	Censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love	5
12960	3675	The tv companies even censor historical movies	6
12961	3675	If its a historical movie, it shouldn't be censored because it takes away from the true story	7
12962	3675	Music is another item that tends to get censored quite often	8
12963	3675	With music, if there is a bad word, the word is just skipped over or bleeped out which makes the song sound strange	9
12964	3675	Most songs are censored because parents don't want their children to listen to it	10
12965	3675	I don't think music should be censored just for little kids	11
12966	3675	If the parents don't want their children to hear those words, they shouldn't let their children listen to that kind of music	12
12967	3675	Book tend to be censored and even banned at schools	13
12968	3675	Not too many childrens read books anymore so if they do decide to read a book, we should let them read what they want besause reading helps the mind	14
12969	3675	Some schools banned books becuse of inapropiate language	15
12970	3675	That is unfair because some books are beautifully written, but children can't read them because of language	16
12971	3675	Also, some books are censored because they are too detailed when it comes to certain scenes dealing with sex and crime	17
12972	3675	Some books are just too good to be banned	18
12973	3675	A lot of theings seem to be censored in this world	19
12974	3675	We should have censorship, but it shouldn't be so stricked when it comes to movies, music, and books.	20
12975	3676	The library is meant to be a place that is filled with materials of all different genres and types	0
12976	3676	Many of us go to the library because we are looking for something in particular, rather than just browsing	1
12977	3676	Although some materials that people need to research at the library @MONTH1 be considered inapproproate for certain audiences, it still serves as a useful resource for others	2
12978	3676	This @MONTH1 include getting information for a research paper, renting a movie that needs to be watched for school, or looking for a certain type of book to read	3
12979	3676	By taking certain books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves, we are limiting the amount of materials for people to borrow	4
12980	3676	At many schools, students are asked to write research papers	5
12981	3676	What is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper @MONTH1 include information that is not suitable for all groups of people	6
12982	3676	A student @MONTH1 write a research paper on the effects a certain drug has on an individual	7
12983	3676	Just because the student chooses this topic, does not mean that he or she supports it	8
12984	3676	Some adults @MONTH1 say that information on drugs should not be on the shelves in a library because it @MONTH1 include material that they consider graphic, but a student looks at this material only as a resource for an educational purpose	9
12985	3676	My freshman year we read @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1	10
12986	3676	We also watched the movie to get a better understanding of the differences between our time periods	11
12987	3676	There is death and violence in the movie, along with a brief flash of nudity	12
12988	3676	Many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate	13
12989	3676	The movie helped us to get a real life picture of how things were back then	14
12990	3676	We were mature enough to look past the graphic scences and see the movie for what it really was	15
12991	3676	If this move was taken off the shelf, some people wouldn't have fully understood the story because they couldn't picture it	16
12992	3676	Sometimes, we just want a good book to read	17
12993	3676	Many teens gravitate to the young adult section because it includes age-related material	18
12994	3676	Many books in this section @MONTH1 include works that have a dark or graphic theme with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children	19
12995	3676	If we eliminated books from this section because they are being censored, we will end up with even less teens that read	20
12996	3676	Certain books provide an escape for some teens, and @MONTH1 even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives	21
12997	3676	If libraries start censoring books we @MONTH1 end up with less and less readers as the years go on	22
12998	3676	Instead of censoring the books, we should censor the people reading the books	23
12999	3676	If a parent doesn't want a younger child to read about a certain topic, then they should keep them away from that material	24
13000	3676	Libraries can put age approval marks on certain books to permit only certain age groups to read them	25
13001	3676	Authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library	26
13002	3676	No matter what a person's purpose for reading is, they should have a choice of what kind of material the book contains.	27
13003	3677	There are thousands of books in libraries, which are inapproriate and some that are	0
13004	3677	But libraries are to learn about many things such as reading for fun, reading the newsletter, or just looking for  random information	1
13005	3677	Libraries are places that we refer to when we need to find historical moments, or about animals or anything else	2
13006	3677	We need all books because they teach us the past, they all have a purpose, and we become more intellegent	3
13007	3677	I believe that all books in a library have a purpose	4
13008	3677	They @MONTH1 be offensive but they teach us many things	5
13009	3677	For example, there are books out there that talk about the @CAPS1	6
13010	3677	For some people this @MONTH1 be a touchy subject and some might take it offensively, but if we didn't have those books to learn from we would make the same mistakes as we did back then	7
13011	3677	Books can teach us so much about the past, we can learn so many things from books then anywhere else in the world	8
13012	3677	I also think that all books have a purpose to them	9
13013	3677	whether they are fiction or nonfiction	10
13014	3677	You @MONTH1 ask 'how do fiction books have purpose?' @CAPS2, fiction books have a purpose because they teach us to really use our imagination, quite a bit of books make us relieze that the struggles of a character can be the same struggles of someone in real life	11
13015	3677	And the most important reason is because fiction books not only catch our attention, but they also catch our childrens attention	12
13016	3677	Fiction books are the first books children know how to read, this is where they start their reading skills	13
13017	3677	My last reason for why I don't think 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from shelves is because all books make us more intellegent	14
13018	3677	We learn so much information from all sorts of books	15
13019	3677	Another example would be, that @CAPS3 books could be 'offensive' as @CAPS2, but if we didn't have them we would not have intellegent doctors	16
13020	3677	My final reason why I disagree with books being removed if they aren't suited for everyone is that someone that wants to learn something wouldn't be able to because what they want to learn could be offensive to others	17
13021	3677	What I mean by this is that we would pretty much be telling that person that they are not able to learn something new because others think it's offensive	18
13022	3677	Every human being has a different outlook on something that could be offensive or could not	19
13023	3677	But why should we remove books, magazines, movies, etc from shelves	20
13024	3677	Just because we don't like it doesn't mean we have to remove it	21
13025	3677	Everyone has different taste, we wont ever agree on anything	22
13026	3677	But removing books from shelves isn't fair to anyone	23
13027	3677	Yes, they @MONTH1 be unsuited for others but when we don't like some thing don't we just move along to something we do like	24
13028	3677	Yes we do, so we should do the same thing with books	25
13029	3678	No, I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music , movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the selves if they are found offensive	0
13030	3678	Here are statements on why i believe this	1
13031	3678	First, I think if you are reading, listening, or watching any of these things then dont read the part that is offensive to you	2
13032	3678	If you believe that it is offensive to you then why are you reading it	3
13033	3678	If you believe this is offending you then put it down and forget about it, you dont have to read or watch it	4
13034	3678	I think if you are reading or watching it, then it is at your own fault if you are offended by it	5
13035	3678	When does anyone even write about offending things lately anyway	6
13036	3678	Like I said before if you are reading or watching or whatever it is then it is your own fault, @CAPS1 states that when one of you states you have been offended you just get rid of that thing and tear it away from our lives.Well it stops today I am writing today to stop the people who are ruining other peoples lives by getting rid of what other people like to do	7
13037	3678	If you believe that you should take away our fun and pleasure of doing these things, then do it, but remember of what your taking away from those who like to read all of that.If you get rid of the books that keep us entertained then there will be nothing left on the shelves for any of us	8
13038	3678	I have written in this newspaper of things that should be left alone.I have also written about if you do take away our simple things we like to read, just think about your taking away from those who read, listen or watch these things	9
13039	3678	Take in order of what I have said, goodnight.	10
13040	3679	Libraries @CAPS1't Remove Books     @CAPS2 i would like to start off this story by stating i don't believe that libraries should remove books if they are offensive	0
13041	3679	If a book is offensive thats not a reason to take it off the shelves we watch movies in school today showing the past when @LOCATION1 had slaves	1
13042	3679	I myself don't believe it is fair to show a movie in school about slavery but we cant have a book that doesnt actually show anything to us just tells us whats going on	2
13043	3679	In my eyes a book is less harmless then wating a show on the subject	3
13044	3679	A movie can show alot more detail in it then a book can so i say let the books stay where they are	4
13045	3679	Don't try to shut down a author beacuse you dont like what they wrote their might be more meaning in the book then you can see	5
13046	3679	Just keep reading you never know how the story might go on	6
13047	3679	Just like dont judge a book by its cover	7
13048	3679	We @CAPS1't take away a book someone might like	8
13049	3679	Someone might hate the book but beacuse they hate it would you quit reading it	9
13050	3679	I don't believe it is right to remove something beacuse someone might not like what is it saying	10
13051	3679	i myslef see alot of things i don like everyday but i do not try getting everything changed	11
13052	3679	This is life as i know it there is alot of offencive people in this world and it wont change anytime soon not for me or anyone	12
13053	3679	Unless they make a law against being offencive	13
13054	3679	I can see someone in a band saying something offencive about someone but we cant not sell his cd's beacuse someone might like what he said in that song	14
13055	3679	Or i dont like alot of shows and or movies on tv but i dont try to get the station shut down i just change the channel	15
13056	3679	As should lets say someone in a book store sees a offencive book they should just look away	16
13057	3679	Not go and try to get it shut down	17
13058	3679	All i can really say tho is that i couldnt tell you what i would do beacuse i dont read very many books so i dont see them being offencive	18
13059	3679	So i can not tell you i wouldnt be mad but i still would just put the book down and not touch it again.	19
13060	3680	I will be talking about, do think books, music, or even magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive	0
13061	3680	In my opinion I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive too some people	1
13062	3680	Because not all people have the same interests	2
13063	3680	First of all I think things shouldn't be removed from library shelves because people don't like the items because they get offended	3
13064	3680	But the people who like the item say like an explicit @CAPS1 they would probably buy it	4
13065	3680	But also the people who don't the explicit @CAPS2 would get offended and would want it off the shelves	5
13066	3680	Another example can be a book	6
13067	3680	what if a person didn't like what he/she read and gets offended	7
13068	3680	They would return the book and would not want to sell anymore and wouldn't mention it to a friend	8
13069	3680	But another person comes along and picks the same book and did like what he/she did read and that person would probably recommend it to a friend	9
13070	3680	The same way goes for a magazine also	10
13071	3680	What if a person gets offended at an advertizement	11
13072	3680	A person likes it and returns it, then comes along another person who gets offended at it and doesn't like it it shouldn't stop selling for that particcular person	12
13073	3680	In conclusion I think things in the library shouldn't stop selling because one person gets offended at it	13
13074	3680	they shouldn've look at the item in first place.	14
13075	3682	For as long as people can remember books have been banned for various reasons	0
13076	3682	Whether it be a time of war or a religious restriction, it is always viewed as a negative thing and therefore should be no different today	1
13077	3682	Though it @MONTH1 be a bit less extreme, books or content such as movies, music, or magazines should not be removed from library shelves based on someone else's opinion	2
13078	3682	It is a right to be able to obtain the information theses materials offer	3
13079	3682	No material should ever be removed from a public library based on censorship	4
13080	3682	Some @MONTH1 argue that certain material @MONTH1 be offensive to other groups of people, but who is it to judge how another feels	5
13081	3682	Material is written or made to show the feelings of the author and how they want thier feelings or knowledge portrayed	6
13082	3682	The author is merely taking advantage of their freedom of speech	7
13083	3682	It is at the responsibility of the public to how they use the information they receive	8
13084	3682	It is still a piece of history and was recorded for a reason	9
13085	3682	Religion is always a hot point when it comes to censorship, but is that not in our constitution	10
13086	3682	Freedom of religion includes how we interpret and study our religions	11
13087	3682	Most have holy books and writings	12
13088	3682	Many express their religion by means of music and culture	13
13089	3682	It is a right for the public to be able to access this material	14
13090	3682	There are some rare situations when restrictions @MONTH1 need to be upheld but merely based on age	15
13091	3682	This however doesn't restrict the public, but offers parents the right to censor what information their children are able to get ahold of	16
13092	3682	An age limit on specific types of material could be added in the cases of sexual content, vulgar images, or distrubing content unsuitable for children	17
13093	3682	This way information is never censored completely	18
13094	3682	It is never right to tell people what they can or can not know	19
13095	3682	It is a part of the very structure of our country to allow all information to be shared freely	20
13096	3682	Censorhip of these materials is not and never will be the answer	21
13097	3682	Although, age restrictions @MONTH1 be an answer for younger citizens these materials aren't taken away from the public	22
13098	3682	Whatever it @MONTH1 be called, book banning or censorship, it is a negative thing and should not be a part of our public library systems.	23
13099	3683	Should there be censorship in libraries	0
13100	3683	People think that there should be and some think it shouldn't matter	1
13101	3683	I think there shouldn't be because maybe some people like those books	2
13102	3683	I have three reasons why there shouldn't be censorship	3
13103	3683	My reasons are first people like certain books and should be able to get what ever they want	4
13104	3683	Second, the libraries should be able to put what ever they want on the shelfs	5
13105	3683	Third, if you don't like what the books say then don't get the book	6
13106	3683	Libraries have many books for you to choose from and you can pick which book you want to check out	7
13107	3683	Libraries don't need to censor their books because some people might want books like that	8
13108	3683	Everybody has there own preference on the kinds of books and music that they like	9
13109	3683	Censorship wouldn't allow them to get what they want which would make them mad	10
13110	3683	There is all kinds of genres of books and music around, some have more strong language in them then other genres	11
13111	3683	Some people like their music uncensored and should be able to get it	12
13112	3683	Libraries and entertainment stores are the ones who buy the books and music not you	13
13113	3683	Libraries have the freedom to get what ever books they want to and put them on shelves	14
13114	3683	If you don't like what certain books or music say then go get something you do like	15
13115	3683	There is no rule that says you have to get a certain kind of music	16
13116	3683	Some people like the music genre called rap which does have some strong language in it but its your choice to listen to it	17
13117	3683	the stores just put the products on the shelf to make money not to get you angry about what the products say	18
13118	3683	There are sections on the shelves that say what genre they are	19
13119	3683	People that want to say something about what the language is like in the book should not have checked it out	20
13120	3683	You have the right to ask what certain music, books, or movies are like, and movies have ratings on the case	21
13121	3683	Music and movies have ratings which tell you how strong the language is on the cases	22
13122	3683	People can not say to monitor that when it tells you everything thats in the movie or @CAPS1	23
13123	3683	The libraires and stores usually mark the sections on what genre they are	24
13124	3683	That can tell you where the uncensored parts are	25
13125	3683	You can stay away from those sections if you find them offensive	26
13126	3683	The libraries should not have to censor there books and entertainment store should not need to censor all the music and movies	27
13127	3683	Its your choice what to get not theirs	28
13128	3683	People can stay away from those areas that they find offensive	29
13129	3683	Everybody should be able to get what they want even if it might offend others.	30
13130	3684	Have you ever watched a movie that had some scenes you didnt't want your kids to watch with you	0
13131	3684	What are you suppose to do when this problem happens time and time agian	1
13132	3684	Do you just tell your kids to close there eyes and cover there ears	2
13133	3684	Well i honestly think that shouldn't ever have to happen to you	3
13134	3684	I think that you as a parent or adult should be warned about certain behaviors during a moive	4
13135	3684	That you do not approve your child of watching even if it is with you ,it's just flat out wrong I would say	5
13136	3684	So i say that we should get some kind of extra warning that these innapporiate behaviors are showing up in movies	6
13137	3684	Parents should be able to know what there kinds are bout to watch is ok for there age and what not	7
13138	3684	So to wrap this all up nice and sweet	8
13139	3684	Just make some kind of label that says that there might be things in the movies or whatever item such as books and magazines also	9
13140	3684	That there might be things that a parent will find innapporiate for a child to watch or read	10
13141	3684	If the people that make these products do this it will be much more easier for parents to do the right thing for there children	11
13142	3686	Cencorship     The topic I am going to discuss today is censorship	0
13143	3686	Do you think that censorship is a good thing or a bad thing	1
13144	3686	I am going to list a couple of ways that i think censorship is bad and also why it is good	2
13145	3686	The first thing I am going to talk to you about is how it is bad	3
13146	3686	The bad part about censorship is that it can offend people very easily	4
13147	3686	Most people can handle alot of abuse, but on the otherhand alot of people can't	5
13148	3686	In my oppinion I think that it is fine to have some things out that offend people because that is how alot of people find humor	6
13149	3686	Such as political cartoon	7
13150	3686	They make fun of the @CAPS1 and alot of the other people that are in office, but you dont see them complaining about it	8
13151	3686	In my oppinion if you dont like it then dont read it	9
13152	3686	That is all you have to do and then it will never bother you again	10
13153	3686	But on the other hand i can see how some people can get offended	11
13154	3686	Because some of the things are very mean in books and movies	12
13155	3686	I think that there should be some type of line that seperates going to fare and what is good enough	13
13156	3686	most people can live with it, but others can't	14
13157	3686	Such as @CAPS2, there is a whole lot of @CAPS2 in the @LOCATION1, and expecally in this time period	15
13158	3686	where ever you go there is always some sort of @CAPS2	16
13159	3686	In conclusion I think that people need to get together and create a line that can be drawn befor they get to far	17
13160	3686	and some of the stuff now needs to be taking off of the shelves, but not everything	18
13161	3687	Books, movies, magazines, music, and most of all, life	0
13162	3687	We all know whats wrong, and what's right	1
13163	3687	Every school is different	2
13164	3687	Some schools have limits on their books, such as if you're two years old, and reading something like @PERSON1, then that's gonna be inappropriate	3
13165	3687	If you're sixteen and reading a @PERSON2 book, then that's too inappropriate for their age limit	4
13166	3687	Every age is different, so your not going to find some forty-three year old hobo on the streets reading, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS1' by @PERSON2	5
13167	3687	Most likely, he'll be reading a mystery book, or something appropriate for his age not for someone that's five	6
13168	3687	Books shouldn't be banned because some elementary mother doesn't want her seven year old reading '@CAPS4'	7
13169	3687	Just because some mothers want it banned, doesn't mean it should be	8
13170	3687	Be smarter and watch what your kids are reading, it shouldn't have to be banned from other children just because you don't want your kid reading it	9
13171	3687	Don't we all agree that music is life	10
13172	3687	Not everyone has to listen to rap, nor do they have to listen to opera	11
13173	3687	Don't you see that we have musical artist in the world that depend on music	12
13174	3687	So why should rap be banned just because it talks about killing, drugs, and drinking	13
13175	3687	I say who cares	14
13176	3687	Don't listen to it if you don't like it, it doesn't mean you have to ruin it for everyone else	15
13177	3687	I love all kinds of music, so nothing should be banned	16
13178	3687	In my opinion I hate christian songs, I think they're too slow, and constantly talking about @CAPS5, but that doesn't mean I should ruin it for everyone else, just because I hate it	17
13179	3687	Everyone is different, no one is the same	18
13180	3687	Music helps me gets through life, and I know it helps you get through yours too, it shouldn't be banned	19
13181	3687	Movies, movies, movies	20
13182	3687	Video games, video games, video games	21
13183	3687	We all love cuddling and watching movies together, but not all movies are right for us	22
13184	3687	Movies have ratings like video games do	23
13185	3687	Ratings show what's appropriate for a twelve year old verses a twenty-five year old	24
13186	3687	Adults would most likely be playing a rated @CAPS6 game, and watching rated @CAPS7 movies	25
13187	3687	Little kids about the age of six would be playing rated @CAPS8 games, and watching rated @CAPS9 movies	26
13188	3687	As you can see everyone is different especially when it comes to these things	27
13189	3687	Rated @CAPS7 movies usually have gore, sexual themes, strong language, and things little kids should never watch	28
13190	3687	It doesn't mean it should be banned, maybe blocked in your home, but not banned	29
13191	3687	In my opinion, I think all movies, books, music, video games, etc., shouldn't be banned	30
13192	3687	It just should all be carefully watched to see who's hands it lands into, and who's eyes are viewing it	31
13193	3687	We should be responsible enough to pick out the material for ourselves	32
13194	3687	No one should tell me what not to read or watch: unless I am a youth	33
13195	3687	Then material should be suppervised by my parents.	34
13196	3688	Censorship in libraries	0
13197	3688	That could be a good and a bad thing	1
13198	3688	Is it really that big of a deal for kids to see some bad things in books	2
13199	3688	Will authors remove their books from libraries	3
13200	3688	Censorship in Libraries is not as needed as most people think	4
13201	3688	Children now a days know a lot of things and are intelligent about certain subjects	5
13202	3688	I understand parents dont want their children to read books containing drugs, @CAPS1, sex, etc	6
13203	3688	Their going to have to learn about it sometime in their life though	7
13204	3688	They might as well get ahead start on it now	8
13205	3688	Young children most of the time are not even interested in going to those kinds of books anyway	9
13206	3688	If you censor all the books in the libraries then some students would be in trouble on projects they @MONTH1 need those kinds of books for	10
13207	3688	Say I needed a book on '@CAPS1' for a project im doing in @CAPS2 class	11
13208	3688	If the books are censored then I would have no sources to get information from	12
13209	3688	On the other hand, I can see why adults would want the books censored	13
13210	3688	No parent wants their child coming home from school talking about sex, and drugs they saw in a book at school	14
13211	3688	If I was a parent I would be concerned myself	15
13212	3688	If it's that big of a deal to some adults then what are they going to do when their children see the same stuff only worse on t.v	16
13213	3688	Commercials about condoms, and advertisements telling them to use drugs/@CAPS1	17
13214	3688	Atleast with books, the book is teaching you about the drug and how dangerous it is for you	18
13215	3688	If one author takes their book off the shelf because they don't want children reading it, then that gives all authors to do the same	19
13216	3688	Which could mean that we would have no books on the shelves for anybody	20
13217	3688	Books are a key to learning	21
13218	3688	We need to keep ALL books in the libraries no matter how explicit they are	22
13219	3688	Parents should sit down and talk with their children about not picking up those kinds of books if they don't want their child reading them	23
13220	3688	Yes, I have seen people pick those books up and start making jokes about them, but thats what children do when their immature	24
13221	3688	You have to expect that from kids now a days	25
13222	3688	No matter how bad they are their informational books and we need them to learn	26
13223	3689	NO, I do not think that books, music, magizines and etc	0
13224	3689	should be removed from the shelves if found offensive	1
13225	3689	Books help people in many ways	2
13226	3689	Music helps people find their activity in many ways	3
13227	3689	Also magizines helps people do things thats meant to be done	4
13228	3689	The reason I said books help people is because it furthers one knowledge to understand things better	5
13229	3689	It also hepls one vocabulary more stronger than it once was	6
13230	3689	Last but not least it helps people become more focused and when saying that I mean that it makes you understand how to be focused on the main idea and the whole concept of the book	7
13231	3689	When people read and they don't understand what they are reading, they look further to try and understand the words they misunderstood which is good because you will learn alot more then you thought you did	8
13232	3689	Music is also a very good thing to use because it make people calm when they have had an long stressful day at work, school, doctor, or etc	9
13233	3689	Music also helps you look into your creativity which means you want to do more things such as dance, sing, or some even start to paint	10
13234	3689	When im tired and I have had a long day , I like to go home and lay down and listen to music and that is because I feel relaxed and more calmer	11
13235	3689	Last but not least, magizines	12
13236	3689	Magizines gives you alot of information that one @MONTH1 be seeking for	13
13237	3689	Just say that you were looking for a recipe and you don't have an computer and you have magizines, you can look and a magizine and see when was this recipe effective and by whom it was wrote	14
13238	3689	Also if you were to want to order some things such as shoes, clothes, perfume fragrances, lotions and some even order house hold things if needed	15
13239	3689	When I look in a magizine,I like to order shoes or even just compare the prices of something store bought or the magizine price	16
13240	3689	There are many different things you can look foward to when looking in a magizine	17
13241	3689	So take my advive and try it because sometimes what your'e looking for can be right in your library	18
13242	3689	With all that being sad books, music, and magizines can be very helpful to you and any body else	19
13243	3689	Books are very helpful when it comes to essays or etc	20
13244	3689	Music is very useful when youv'e had a long day at your place of buisness or etc	21
13245	3689	Magizines are very self explanatory when it comes to food, clothing, shoes, topics , essays ,cars ,houses or etc	22
13246	3689	When you have a question or a concern or maybe even a doubt you can go to your nearest own personal library and borrow or read a book, magizine or listen to a little music	23
13247	3689	All  these things can be helpful and all you have to do is take in it and take advantage of free information that is given to you	24
13248	3689	All of these things can help you in a way	25
13249	3691	Censorship seems like a great idea at first thought	0
13250	3691	It allows parents to have their children closely monitored without actually monitoring them	1
13251	3691	Consequently, censorship in libraries creates the possibilty for every book ever written to be removed from shelves around the world	2
13252	3691	There are multiple things wrong with the idea of censorship	3
13253	3691	It creates objections due to differences in opinions and autors being completely and uterly offended	4
13254	3691	Censorship is a disgrace and should not be forced in libraries	5
13255	3691	People have different criteria when it comes to deciding a level of offensiveness	6
13256	3691	For intsense, if a fifty-year-old @CAPS1 female read a violent book with some curse words and sexual content she might think that it was offensive	7
13257	3691	Likewise, if a twenty-one-year-old, careless male read the exact same book he would probably enjoy its content	8
13258	3691	This defference in opinion poses as a huge problem in allowing libraries to censor their selecion	9
13259	3691	I feel that it would be unfair to remove books that some audiences would enjoy	10
13260	3691	Instead of completely banning some texts, why not move them to another section of the library	11
13261	3691	Libraries could take some time to separate the books into categories and the books that they feel are offensive could go into a separate section of the library	12
13262	3691	This section could be as simple a separate shelf, or could go to the extreme of a separate room or area closed in by a curtain	13
13263	3691	Either way, completely getting rid of books because of their content is a terrible idea	14
13264	3691	Authors could potentially lose money from the action of censorship	15
13265	3691	They put in numberous hours and a lot of effort to write books and novels	16
13266	3691	Some spend years trying to perfect their masterpieces	17
13267	3691	Magazines and movies provide the same amount of time, but they also aquire an unimagineable amount of money	18
13268	3691	If these authors, directors, and producers have their specific product taken off of the shelves it would be offensive to them	19
13269	3691	They could have a decrease in sales which would cause a decrease in money as well	20
13270	3691	The idea is simply unfair	21
13271	3691	Librarians have the right to display the content of which they choose, but making them remove products that they feel are fine is ridiculous	22
13272	3691	I think that censorship is a terrible idea	23
13273	3691	If anything should be banned from a library it should be censorship itself!	24
13274	3692	Have you ever seen a crazy person walking around saying odd or unique theories	0
13275	3692	Everybody is different and have their own opinion about what they think is right	1
13276	3692	It is alright to have different beleifs but that shouldnt mean people shouldnt seek to understand others	2
13277	3692	I beleive that the censorship in libraries is very important but that people need to seek to understand each other more, not be so stubborn, and look at different perspectives so that people can get along easier	3
13278	3692	Many different materials are found in libraries and some of them are more censored than others	4
13279	3692	Many times the reason that the books or magazines are censored is because they portray strong ideas and theories	5
13280	3692	People have the right to speech so they should be able to show others what they beleive, but they need to make sure that showing what they know is not hurting anyone else	6
13281	3692	Explicit movies and music are very bad with seeking to understand	7
13282	3692	They are good because of the rating systems but still are very ignorant to others	8
13283	3692	Many people just simply take the ideas of others the wrong way	9
13284	3692	People have trouble looking at things in different perspectives and because of it they can cause trouble	10
13285	3692	If people would seek to understand more, then the conflicts of different beleifs would not be as common	11
13286	3692	When people have different perspectives, they can be more knowledgable of various opionions	12
13287	3692	Some people are just stubborn	13
13288	3692	They choose to only beleive their ideas and refuse to listen to anyone else's	14
13289	3692	Being stubborn is the opposite of seeking to understand	15
13290	3692	If people were less stubborn, they could see more perspectives and become more aware of how others felt	16
13291	3692	When people are stubborn, it can be very hard for others to deal with or for them to get along well with others	17
13292	3692	In conlusion I do think censorship is important but I think that the reasons why we censor things are equally important as well	18
13293	3692	If people were more understanding of others, then we could have more censorship for the things that agrivate other people	19
13294	3692	We would also have less censorship for people who only try to spread there ideas	20
13295	3692	If people sought to understand, ;ooked for different perspectives, and were not so stubborn, then they would get along much better	21
13296	3693	I understand how some people @MONTH1 get offended by some things they @MONTH1 watch or they might read but that doesn't mean that other people shouldn't be able to know about it because one person doesn't like it	0
13297	3693	It's kind of a matter of opinion of whether it is offensive or not	1
13298	3693	I myself have never really read or watched anything that was completely uncalled for	2
13299	3693	On just about every movie or music album that is produced they rate it so that you can know who should be watching this movie and who shouldn't	3
13300	3693	If the movie was made with somekind of offensive parts to it then they put with the rating that yes, their is some rude language and things like that	4
13301	3693	So just because somebody didn't read close enough to see that their might be something they don't like in the movie shouldn't cause everyone else to not be able to see that particular movie	5
13302	3693	Personally I don't find books to be the greatest things but I am sure of that some books or magazines do tend to have something rude or crude in them but it's not always horrible	6
13303	3693	If someone thinks that the book @MONTH1 be inapproiate for some readers then they could tell a person in charge in the library that maybe they should only be letting certain people be reading that book because of the content	7
13304	3693	You shouldn't have to throw a book off a shelf because one or two people thought bad about it	8
13305	3693	If it was me choosing whether or not to take movies, books, magazines, etc off of the shelfs I wouldn't	9
13306	3693	I say this because @PERCENT1 of the time things have been rated or in someway approved to be put on general store shelfs	10
13307	3693	People can simply read details on the back and see that it's not going to bother them in a way or that it could be offensive and they shouldn't be purchasing	11
13308	3693	If someone complained about a new cd or movie that I personally wanted to see or listen to and it was taken off shelfs I would be upset about it because it probley wouldn't even offened me at all	12
13309	3693	So no, i completely disagree with the idea of movies or books and music having to stop sales because two or three people were offended by it's content	13
13310	3694	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies etc	0
13311	3694	should not be removed if they are found offensive	1
13312	3694	The library has different sections for different groups like the yound @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 section, easy children or picture and @CAPS1	2
13313	3694	Young @CAPS1 or the @CAPS2 section is for mainly the teens	3
13314	3694	They have books that a teen who normally read	4
13315	3694	The @CAPS2 section has music which teens listen to	5
13316	3694	For @CAPS4 they have the twlight soundtrack	6
13317	3694	This section does not have any explicit language.The teens who go into the library actually enjoy the select of books offered to them.It has everything most teens like to read about	7
13318	3694	There is nothing offensive in this section and it should not be removed	8
13319	3694	There is also a childrens section called the easy or picture book section	9
13320	3694	This section are for the younger children	10
13321	3694	Children that are not in school or in the early stages of school	11
13322	3694	The books, music an movies in this section are cartoons an animals	12
13323	3694	Things that children would like to read, listen or watch about	13
13324	3694	For @CAPS4 this section has movies like strawberry shortcake, athur, even lilo and stitch	14
13325	3694	eveything in this section is made for children there is not one thing in this section where the child or parent who think is offensive	15
13326	3694	The library has a section for adults	16
13327	3694	The @CAPS1 section is there to catch adults eye	17
13328	3694	It a separate fom the @CAPS2 and Children sections	18
13329	3694	It is located at the other end of the library	19
13330	3694	If there is an @CAPS1 who thinks that something is offensive they have the right to talk to someone who works at the library	20
13331	3694	Most adults do not have a problem with the items in thier section	21
13332	3694	The library keeps the adults section with things that adults would want to look for	22
13333	3694	It would not have something little children would want	23
13334	3694	The entire library is split up into different sections	24
13335	3694	It is easy for the children to look at books for them and for adults to do the same	25
13336	3694	There are only a few that I named but every age group has a specific spot at the library	26
13337	3694	If there is something found offensive to the people I dont think it should be removed because it might just be in the wrong section	27
13338	3694	The library takes great precaution to the censorship of their books, movies music etc	28
13339	3696	Everywhere one goes, something is being kept from them	0
13340	3696	It is either to keep them safe, pure, or happy	1
13341	3696	In the everyday world people who break the law are put into jails and prisons	2
13342	3696	Not only is it a punishment for them, but it is also to keep them away from other people	3
13343	3696	This is much like how our libraries are becoming	4
13344	3696	Books that have questionable content are being thrown out	5
13345	3696	I do not believe that this should be done	6
13346	3696	Books are here to enlighten people and let them experience something they never would have been able to on their own	7
13347	3696	People should be able to choose what they @CAPS5 and if it offends them they can choose by theirselves to stop reading that book	8
13348	3696	Many times I have learned new things from books that @MONTH1 not have been appropriate for my age, but it taught me a valuable lesson	9
13349	3696	For example, I @CAPS5 a book about a teenage girl engaging in sexual relations, she became pregnant and it ruined her life	10
13350	3696	From this, at the age of ten years old, I learned that I do not want that to happen to me, so I am abstaining from adult relations until I am married	11
13351	3696	Of course the libraries should be seperated into different categories such as: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 at Your Own @CAPS6	12
13352	3696	Also, the same with magazines and music	13
13353	3696	That way, a person could go to a specific section and know what to expect from there	14
13354	3696	This is much like the movie ratings, a mother can pick up a movie and see that it is rated @CAPS7 and know that it is exceptable for her nine-year old to watch, except possibly save for a few curse words, but a child hears that in their everyday life anyways, wether the parent knows it or not	15
13355	3696	In conclusion, I believe that literature should not be censored from the people	16
13356	3696	However, it should be categorized so a person could have an idea of what age group it would be most appropriate for	17
13357	3696	People have the right to choose what books they @CAPS5 and what they @CAPS5 about	18
13358	3696	Everyone can learn a valuable lesson from any book, it just depends on how they interprate it.	19
13359	3697	I belive that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves if they are found to be  offensive	0
13360	3697	The main reason I say that is becuase there are not just postive things in this world ,but there are alot of negitves also	1
13361	3697	It is very important for children to learn and understand the things that are going on in the world they live in reguardless if they are good or bad	2
13362	3697	Everyone is going to have to learn about the things going on around them sooner or later ,so it is better to find it out as a child rather then later on in life when you might not have someone there to explain it all to you	3
13363	3697	I understand, there are some age limits that should be inforced becuase of some of the fowl nature of them	4
13364	3697	Though at some point and time before a child becomes an adult they should know most of the basics of life no matter how positive or negitive	5
13365	3697	Children should not be shelter at a young age to just young adult things because they need to know what else is out there in the world	6
13366	3697	For example, children should be taught that there really are bad people in the world	7
13367	3697	If they dont understand that something bad could happen to them beucase they did not know the dangers around them because they never learned it	8
13368	3697	When I was younger it was required to know other people out side of your race or religion beucase not just your race or religon is in this world	9
13369	3697	Also we learned the diffrence between good and bad choices	10
13370	3697	If us children did not learn that at an early age many of them would be in some very rough situations today	11
13371	3697	On the other hand there is an extent the children need to learn also	12
13372	3697	For example, say you buy a video game for your child ,but make sure you inforce to them that killing and shooting is not something that they should be doing out in the real world	13
13373	3697	Make sure you teach them the diffrence between really and fakeness	14
13374	3697	That is a main reason why kids today do not have self control becuase of the things they learn off of video games	15
13375	3697	Now a days on @CAPS1 there are people being preasured by the media to act out of there charater just to get attation	16
13376	3697	They are publicsizing sexual and inapproprate things for child to be learning about at a young age ,but they need to be aware that its out there and it is bad	17
13377	3697	In magazines they will destorte famous peoples bodies to make them look like something they are not to make people feel like they are not good enough	18
13378	3697	Children sould be taught that not eveything they see, hear ,and read are not always right or true	19
13379	3697	With todays media and materials it is easy to know the diffrence between right and wrong ,but they put it out there as if one person is doing it it is ok for everyone to be doing it	20
13380	3697	In most cases it is not until that person understand all of the facts about it and can make rashanal dessicions on there own and on there own time	21
13381	3697	Children now a days will get  presured by media, magazines ,and sometimes by peers	22
13382	3697	The media is telling them to do something that is not neccessarliy right ,but is popular	23
13383	3697	You should not teach you children off of things like that it will make them want to do things without thinking or considering what is really going on	24
13384	3697	With todays magazines, the writers will make people look like something they really are not just to make them look good	25
13385	3697	That is not fair to readers, the person that is being expoused, or the author themself	26
13386	3697	Finally, with peer pressure today kids will see something off of television and try it then try and get there friends to do it even though they know it is not the right thing to do	27
13387	3697	I belive that children, when they are faced with delimia's like these, should know right from wrong with the trouble they are faceing	28
13388	3697	If they know nothing about it they need to walk away or learn how to say no reguardless of how hard it might be	29
13389	3697	In conclusion, I believe that the children now a days that are exposed to any type of offensive things should know the meaning behind it	30
13390	3697	Also they should know the right ways to haddle it when they are put in certain situations	31
13391	3697	Lastly, I believe kids should know what is going on around them so when they grow up they know how to fend for themselves ,and not be counting on someone else to tell them baisc things that are going on in the world around them.	32
13392	3698	In @DATE1, there are many rap/hip-hop artists	0
13393	3698	They all sing about gangs, narcotics, alcohol, and using women for favors	1
13394	3698	@DATE1 is something that our children should not be exposed to at such a young age	2
13395	3698	There are children that know the words to alot of the rap songs out there	3
13396	3698	The parenting skills of some parents also reflect on if the children learn the words or not	4
13397	3698	I understand that children have to be exposed to some things in life	5
13398	3698	There are other genres of music that deal with all of the things i listed above	6
13399	3698	I dont think that it is right though for young children to learn about these things	7
13400	3698	How would you feel if your child came up to you asking what drugs are 	8
13401	3698	Or what alcohol is	9
13402	3698	I also understand that we should let our kids get a little taste of the real world to see what it is like for themselves but that can only go to a certain extent	10
13403	3698	After that extent, the kids would be learning too much at such a young age	11
13404	3698	In my personal opinion, we could let our children listen to an edited version of the songs or even chose a different genre that doesnt use those such topcis as much	12
13405	3698	Country music for example is very peaceful to me	13
13406	3698	I suggest that people listen to it because it is very realistic in ways	14
13407	3698	I also understand that rap music can be realistic in ways too	15
13408	3698	Everyone has a different outlook on what kind of music children should be allowed to listne to	16
13409	3698	I will sometimes listen to rap music but i would never allow my kids to listen to the uncensored version	17
13410	3698	Magazines also have alot to do with why children are so 'street' smart these days	18
13411	3698	Magazines can put false information out so people will believe it	19
13412	3698	Magazine companies put revealing pictures of people on the front cover to catch someones attention	20
13413	3698	It works most of the time and children also see that	21
13414	3698	They are young and nieve so they will do what they see someone else do	22
13415	3698	That includes looking at the magazines with good looking men or women on them	23
13416	3698	Another subject is the movies that are coming out in @DATE1 world	24
13417	3698	Movies can reveal whatever they want	25
13418	3698	Normally the movies that are inappropiate for children are rated @ORGANIZATION1 will find a way to see @DATE1 stuff	26
13419	3698	A child could be on the internet and something accidentally pops up	27
13420	3698	All of the advertisements on the side of the computer screen are viruses just waiting for children to click on it unintentionally	28
13421	3698	These are my strong opinions on what we should do with todays society	29
13422	3698	We need to try and watch what our children are listening to and watching	30
13423	3698	I know that we cant watch their every move but we can do our best to watch what they are doing when they are in close watch	31
13424	3698	Thank you for your time!	32
13425	3700	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf	0
13426	3700	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
13427	3700	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'	2
13428	3700	Although I understand her message, I don't completely agree with it	3
13429	3700	I believe most things such as books, music, magazines, etc	4
13430	3700	should be censored in some cases	5
13431	3700	One reason why I think there should be censorship is because of minors that @MONTH1 want to see things that @MONTH1 not be suitable for them	6
13432	3700	First of all, children often follow after what they see	7
13433	3700	For example, adutly trends that they see on the television	8
13434	3700	Not all things adults do are not appropriate for the young eyes.That's why I consider that the things that are broadcast should be censored	9
13435	3700	Children are being influenced by things that they see, read and/or listen to	10
13436	3700	Another reason why I believe there should be censorship is because of a lot of very explicit action that appears in today's movies, books, magazines, and music	11
13437	3700	Violence is a main topic  in newspaper articles	12
13438	3700	For instance, most front page content is about the wars and hostility in the world	13
13439	3700	It is hard to believe that we ever had a peaceful day without any violence	14
13440	3700	Disrespectful acts, cussing, and rude gestures are not a positive way to keep a more mature role going that will make a better environment	15
13441	3700	Because libraries are public, they are open to all eyes so we must be careful about what we allow on their shelves	16
13442	3700	In addition, censoring is the correct thing to do	17
13443	3700	Where would it lead us if we don't	18
13444	3700	Do we want our society to be badly influenced by a bunch of profanity, violent slogans, or jargon	19
13445	3700	Shouldn't we all want to be treated with respect and common courtesy and avoid promoting outrageous movies, music, and books on the shelves of our public libraries for everyone to see	20
13446	3700	So now you can see why I believe that such things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc	21
13447	3700	should have some type of censorship	22
13448	3700	We don't want all the disrespect in the country, so why make it available in our public libraries	23
13449	3700	Keep these things separate: adult books, magazine, movies, music, etc.	24
13450	3701	Censorship	0
13451	3701	If someone does not like what a book, magazine, movie, etc., shows then they should put it back up and not worry about it	1
13452	3701	But their are people who do make a big deal about that kinda stuff	2
13453	3701	Most people who do i personally think are immature	3
13454	3701	Censorship in libraries would take away from people some historical readings, because of nude statues and the way they talked	4
13455	3701	A lot of the old plays were very sexual and many people find them offensive today	5
13456	3701	Sometimes their is no way of getting around inapropriate materials	6
13457	3701	Then their are a lot of people who find those subjects very intersting and like to study it	7
13458	3701	So by taking those books off the shelf those people would not have any way of researching those materials and therefore they would get upset and complain	8
13459	3701	The music that is out today has a lot of inapropriate words and sayings in them that would be offensive to most people	9
13460	3701	But the teens and younger adults like that kind of music and enjoy listening to it	10
13461	3701	Most of the time they aren't listening to the words, but just like the beat of the song	11
13462	3701	Almost all of the older people hate this music and never wanna hear it and think it should be banned	12
13463	3701	What they dont realize is that if it was taken out of the library their would be more upset and angry people then happy	13
13464	3701	Magazines and movies today have a lot of inapropriate advertisements and pictures, but now that is what most people like and want to see	14
13465	3701	You cant really take anything out of a library because either way their would be a lot of upset people	15
13466	3701	Taking all the materials out of the library would most likely take the number of vistors that come to the library go down, because what they are intersted in would not be their anymore so they would have no reason to go anymore	16
13467	3701	That is what most likely would happen if the books, magazines, movies music, etc., were found offensive and were taking off the shelves	17
13468	3702	From what I seen in my life about censorship is that they should not take stuff off of the shelf just because of its content	0
13469	3702	I think that libraries should keep the thing in the shelves but seperated from the rest if found offensive	1
13470	3702	It's bad enough that everybody is offended by the smallest thing which makes it difficult for everybody else to enjoy it	2
13471	3702	I think that we should not even censor the content because I feel like that is making people wanting to know why they censored it in the first place	3
13472	3702	My personal opinion is that censorship is useless because it ruins it for everybody because one person got offended	4
13473	3702	I like the saying sticks and stones @MONTH1 break my bones but words will never hurt because it says if your offended then get over it	5
13474	3702	Why should your opinion speak for everyone else	6
13475	3702	Another reason why I believe that we shouldn't censor things is if someone really wants to know they could always find a way to get it so the censorship thing is kind of pointless	7
13476	3702	I also feel like censorship is making people soft because everything is censored and when people get into the real world they get hit hard	8
13477	3702	My conclusion is that they should seperate the stuff that is offensive and put it in another section of the library	9
13478	3702	They could also develop a rating system like they do in video games so you know what kind of content is in it	10
13479	3702	Simple stuff like this can make everyone happy because the person who is offended doesn't have look at the stuff that he hates.	11
13480	3703	I do not think that libraries or any one should have censorship to books, movies, music, magazines ect	0
13481	3703	People who put there time to writing all of there thought and ideas in that should not be just thrown off the shelf	1
13482	3703	People who wrote that stuff have freedom of seach and the wright to write that stuff or say that stuff	2
13483	3703	Yes I have read books that I have found offensive or that I don't like, but I dont think they should not be in libraries	3
13484	3703	They are there because some other people @MONTH1 like that kind of stuff no reason why we should exclude what they like to read out of the libraries that everyone shares and goes to	4
13485	3703	There would be nothing left in libraries because almost everything out there someone could find offensive	5
13486	3703	For example people such as @ORGANIZATION1	6
13487	3703	People say his lyrics and music say alot of bad stuff but most of his music is about him and his life	7
13488	3703	He has the freedom of speach to wright and publish that for the world to see and hear	8
13489	3703	His music is just i @CAPS1 of his life	9
13490	3703	In history @CAPS2 because he killed people	10
13491	3703	Should take him off the shelf because jews @MONTH1 think it was offensive, yeah it might be but it lets people know about our history and what has happened	11
13492	3703	If we keep that cencored who know history my repeat its self	12
13493	3703	which is a saying I have heard many of times	13
13494	3703	So censorship or not I just think they had the freedom of speach to write that stuff down and be put in a library for people to see learn, edgucate, and entertain themselves by	14
13495	3703	Doesn't mean if it offeneds you that its offensive to other people	15
13496	3704	Do you think that books, music, movies, magazines and other media material in libraries should be censored	0
13497	3704	Why should information and knowledge be with held from people	1
13498	3704	Learning is exceptional for not just only the person reading, but also the human race	2
13499	3704	There are two arguments to cenorship in libraries	3
13500	3704	I believe in not allowing censorship in libraries	4
13501	3704	In the @ORGANIZATION1, everyone is given the right of free speech	5
13502	3704	Taking someones work and blocking it because it is 'unorthodox' or 'offensive' takes away that persons' rights	6
13503	3704	Also, people go to libraries to find something out	7
13504	3704	They look for knowledge and taking away a persons' learning capacity can be harmful to everyone	8
13505	3704	When one article gets censored another artical after that gets censored and soon most material will be 'offensive' and 'unorthodox.' We will take away man kind's capacity to learn	9
13506	3704	Many reasons support censoring for minor offenses such as: inappropriate language in songs, books, movies, and magazines	10
13507	3704	Also, obscene graphic material in movies and in magazines	11
13508	3704	These are small issues that can be blocked and censorships can make a clean version	12
13509	3704	All minor adjustments and easy to make	13
13510	3704	Taking media off the shelves is not needed	14
13511	3704	The material is not serious enough	15
13512	3704	Minor adjustments can be made so that people can be allowed to read, listen, or watch	16
13513	3704	A library is made forwhat the people want to learn	17
13514	3704	Taking that away is very serious.	18
13515	3706	Turn @CAPS1     @CAPS2 I see a book that I don't particularly care for, I simply put it down	0
13516	3706	I really don't see the need to due @CAPS1 with all books that @MONTH1 be offensive to a single person, or group of people	1
13517	3706	Any time I look through the library, I come across a few books that are slightly inappropriate	2
13518	3706	However, @CAPS2 I see these books, I don't make a big deal about it	3
13519	3706	I just put that book down and continue my search	4
13520	3706	I couldn't imagine how scarse out book selection would be if we were to rid the libraries of all books that people might find offensive	5
13521	3706	Also, there are many people that find The @CAPS3 offensive	6
13522	3706	If we were to remove all @CAPS4 text from libraries, then we would have a hard time passing the word of @CAPS5 to people who do not have access to such literature	7
13523	3706	Although I do not fully agree with the ideas of many theorists, I do not ask that their work be banned from public libraries	8
13524	3706	I don't like @PERSON1's book on eveolution	9
13525	3706	but because of our freedom of speech, he has every right to write about his discoveries and belifs	10
13526	3706	As you can so clearly see, I am by no means claiming to be open-minded to others thoughts or beliefs	11
13527	3706	However, @CAPS2 it comes to literature and and art, I think that a variety makes us unique	12
13528	3706	If everyone read the same books, listened to the same music, and watched the same movies, then we could have a very boring culture	13
13529	3706	That is certainly not the basis on which this great country was founded!	14
13530	3707	Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 are many books, music, and magazines that are saturated with offensive words or obscene themes	0
13531	3707	However, just because a book or song contains an foul word does not mean that the book needs to be sheltered from the public's eyes	1
13532	3707	@CAPS2 are many reasons we should not censor public media	2
13533	3707	We cannot ignore wrongdoings happening in our world	3
13534	3707	plus, in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech	4
13535	3707	and, finally, if media was censored, people @MONTH1 start to think every little word has an offensive connotation	5
13536	3707	If a bystander observes a person being abused in a hallway or alley, the bystander just cannot pretend like the incident never happened	6
13537	3707	If the world never reported accidents, @CAPS2 would be too much crime and terror	7
13538	3707	Sometimes, a book or movie is like a cry for help or a way to raise awareness about some wrongdoing in the world today	8
13539	3707	Most of the time, I only hear about an event through movies or books, and I want to know the honest story, not a fairytale version of it	9
13540	3707	After all, if the language in some slavery books was not as vivid as it is, some people @MONTH1 not oppose slavery as strongly as they do	10
13541	3707	Here in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech	11
13542	3707	We are allowed to give our opinions on any topic, and describe it in any way	12
13543	3707	We should be permitted to say anything we want, even though in our hearts, we should know what is right and wrong	13
13544	3707	People should at least be trusted enough to use their own conscience	14
13545	3707	Also, another reason why books and other media should not be censored is because people @MONTH1 judge almost every little word offensive then	15
13546	3707	Then we @MONTH1 have 'no books left on the shelf' according to Katherine Paterson	16
13547	3707	Once people are allowed to censure books or other media, they would look for words with negative connotations	17
13548	3707	If a word was close to being offensive in one person's perspective, it would be left out	18
13549	3707	Then, many words would be gone	19
13550	3707	Sure some types of media, especially songs and movies, just spill out nasty themes and foul language	20
13551	3707	However, I have the choice to watch a movie or listen to a song	21
13552	3707	I can always change the radio station if I do not like what I am hearing	22
13553	3707	People however, just cannot remove the words of another right from their mouth, no matter how bad it is	23
13554	3707	We just cannot pretend that we all live in a perfect world where everyone is polite and caring	24
13555	3707	If we hear about something wrong in our world today, we need to act	25
13556	3707	However, we might not act if we do not know the full extent of its terror	26
13557	3707	Sincerely,                                                              @PERSON2	27
13558	3708	Everyone likes to watch movies, jam to some music, and get lost in an interesting book	0
13559	3708	Therefore everyone should be able to read, watch, or listen to what they want and the same things as other people are reading, listening to, and watching	1
13560	3708	Some things are needed to look up or look at if one is doing a project	2
13561	3708	Other people just @MONTH1 be entertained by certain peices of liturature, or music	3
13562	3708	In that case, why censor certain things that people are interested in, or even things to research, in libraries	4
13563	3708	Many people enjoy violent writing or gorey movies	5
13564	3708	Reading these things also amusses them	6
13565	3708	So why take away what they like	7
13566	3708	If a library takes certain books off of their shelves, then they could be taking away a type of literature that people are interested in	8
13567	3708	If one removes a book that twenty people take pleasure in reading, then thats twenty people that are not going to want to read anything else	9
13568	3708	People are different in many ways	10
13569	3708	That includes the variety of things humans are interested in	11
13570	3708	For example, things they are interested to read	12
13571	3708	Humans having a major differences in characteristics, meaning they don't enjoy all the same things	13
13572	3708	The articles, magazines, or movies @MONTH1 be not suited for schools or libraries, but if it's a topic people like, or if it's someone needs for a project, then there is no reason to get rid of it	14
13573	3708	Some books offten offend certain groups or races of people, but the book gets it uniqueness from what it says	15
13574	3708	Some books are writen in times of racisim	16
13575	3708	This shuold'nt make a book worth critisizing because that was the way things were said in that time	17
13576	3708	It allows the book to give off a feeling of living in the time is based in	18
13577	3708	On the other hand, some magazines are writen about horrible events and wars, but people find entertainment in reading about these events going on in the world	19
13578	3708	They want to know what is really happening across seas or even around home	20
13579	3708	Someone isn't able to know what's happening is no one lets him or her read the magazine	21
13580	3708	Authors and writers write these things for the entertainment of people who want to read them	22
13581	3708	Due to the wide veriety of interest people have, there are many different types of writings	23
13582	3708	People should'nt have their favorite book taken off shelves just to see that the guy right next to him found the book he loves	24
13583	3708	That just would'nt be fare	25
13584	3708	Libraries should put on the shelf what people write, so that others @MONTH1 enjoy them.	26
13585	3709	When you go to a library you think its going to be a place that is a good influence	0
13586	3709	Your not thinking when you send your kids their that there's going to be bad things	1
13587	3709	Most people go the the library to study or use the computers..	2
13588	3709	But what about the other people	3
13589	3709	I went to the library and saw racest books most adults would find that offensive especially if its an afracan american	4
13590	3709	The thing is that people would also go there and check the books out to sutdy about the old times it's not there to offend people	5
13591	3709	Some books are very infromational and people need to study and learn about the past so that it doesnt happen again	6
13592	3709	Another peroblem most people have is with the adult books parents defantly dont want their children looking or checking thoughs books out	7
13593	3709	But when noone stops them from checking the books out there really is not anything you can do about it	8
13594	3709	I believe that libraries should have an age limit for checking out certen books	9
13595	3709	The last thing is the music it has bad language in it and kid can just check them out with out even trying hard	10
13596	3709	Most parants the to sheild their kids so they will be good and not use dirty language but when the and go to a comunity plase and just listen to anything that causes a peopblem	11
13597	3709	Personially I think that it gives the library a bad name and therefore that get little business	12
13598	3709	You know that if you were a parent you really wouldn't want your kids grabbing racest, adult books, and music and you would like for the government to take some the books and music out of the library	13
13599	3709	I believe that their should be a vote to see if we could have thoughs books amd music removed or atleast put in an adult section in the back	14
13600	3709	My main point of this essay is that they either need to have voting for what goes into the library or they need to start censioring the books and @CAPS1's they put in the library and make accessalble to the comunity	15
13601	3709	The up side to doing that is the library would get mor customers and that means the government would make more money	16
13602	3711	I agree and disagree with the prompt	0
13603	3711	I think that it is good everyone is allowed to take any book off the shelf, listen to any music, watch all types of movies, or read any type of magazine	1
13604	3711	Then I think it isn't okay	2
13605	3711	First, reason for agreeing is because some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc	3
13606	3711	@MONTH1 not be suitable for most young children	4
13607	3711	They @MONTH1 use profanity, show naked pictures, or take about things that a child is not yet supposed to be exposed to at that age	5
13608	3711	Most music and movies these days use bad language or show people having sex or without proper clothing	6
13609	3711	Also, adults @MONTH1 use these materials in a way that could cause many problems with the library	7
13610	3711	So these are my reasons for agreeing that certain materialsm such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if found offensive	8
13611	3711	Then, on the other hand I think that libraries should leave most of the books, movies, music, or magazines on the shelves for everyone to take off	9
13612	3711	I say this because if a child does not be experienced to what could happened if they use bad language or go out without proper clothing, or go on watching adult movies	10
13613	3711	So this gives them an opportunity to see what is wrong with it if they are exposed to these things at a certain age	11
13614	3711	I think it would be better if they had a section for the books other than just taking them off the shelves permenantly	12
13615	3711	In conclusion, I think that this could go both ways	13
13616	3711	But, the books, movies, music, or magazines that are felt like they are offensive should be move to a certain area in the library	14
13617	3712	Hello, I am writing to you today about my concerns about my views on the cencorship in a library	0
13618	3712	First, I think some of the music they play and listen to can be a little graphic	1
13619	3712	I know some of the music that is being played can deprive the feelings of others	2
13620	3712	Music should have meaning and instead of blood and killing it should be about the better things in life	3
13621	3712	Second, I would like to talk about some of the books libraries have	4
13622	3712	I think if they want adult type material they should have a section just for adults	5
13623	3712	reading sould be about what you like but it should also be about what you are able to read	6
13624	3712	Next, I would like to talk about some of the inapropriate magazines that some libraries feature	7
13625	3712	Some magazines show off a little to much for some of the people that go to the library.Most magazines that are show are for adult and teen over a certain age.I believe they should make a section for each of the ages and age group	8
13626	3712	Finally, I would like to get on some of the movies they let people check out	9
13627	3712	Libraies has a graphic selection of movies that are easily in the reach of young children	10
13628	3712	Children do not need to know about any of those types of things at all	11
13629	3712	Libraries need to learn more about there surroundings before they continue what they are doing	12
13630	3712	In conclution, I believe that everyone has the right to a library I just feel everyone doesn't have a right to have everything libraries hold	13
13631	3712	Bad things create bad minds and we have to learn to stay above those influences.Libraries need to change some of there ways and there selections to make things more sucessful on thier behalf	14
13632	3713	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf..' said by Katherine Paterson	0
13633	3713	Books are used to entertain and even teach readers in certain aspects of life	1
13634	3713	Not exactly all books are offensive but some are	2
13635	3713	Those who are, should be taken off the shelfs, especially if it is in a school library	3
13636	3713	Children could take that offensive or violent book into action	4
13637	3713	Other children could show the book to other peers	5
13638	3713	And also, children can get very offended	6
13639	3713	Now should offensive books be taken off the shelfs	7
13640	3713	Children nowadays are being motivated alot	8
13641	3713	Whether it's through television shows, video games, or even music	9
13642	3713	On the news, there has been reports about children being influenced to have a gun and hang themselves, etc	10
13643	3713	Books are meant to entertain readers in a good way and not teach them to become a violent person	11
13644	3713	Some readers who read such things can turn those words into action	12
13645	3713	Then the student could be in trouble	13
13646	3713	And people really wouldn't want that	14
13647	3713	Children have a tendency of showing off to friends	15
13648	3713	If a student sees something offensive or violent on a book, there is a big chance that they will show it to their peers	16
13649	3713	Just because children think it's cool	17
13650	3713	Having one person read this could be a problem, now imagine having more than just one, a whole clique seeing this	18
13651	3713	It could end up in a huge problem, not only for the children and their parents, but also for the school	19
13652	3713	The children learning these new things from the book can cause the children to use everyday and make it popular	20
13653	3713	The school can have a bad image from the students	21
13654	3713	Passing on the information can become a conflict, and people certainly do no want that	22
13655	3713	School is not only a teaching building, but also a social place	23
13656	3713	There are cliques in every school	24
13657	3713	Within the each person there is a different color, religion, style, and personalities	25
13658	3713	Children can be easily hurt	26
13659	3713	If books are being offensive, it can just easily hurt anyone reading that book	27
13660	3713	Once again, books are meant to entertain readers and not to hurt them	28
13661	3713	So why even have authors write something offensive in their books	29
13662	3713	Maybe authors feel the need to add interest in the book and suspense, but not all readers would take it easily	30
13663	3713	Hurting people isn't a fun thing to do, and people certainly do not want to do that	31
13664	3713	So why have offensive books in shelfs	32
13665	3713	These books can cause children to use it in action, to show it off to other peers, and to hurt them as well	33
13666	3713	Children nowadays have it hard on themselves, why make it harder	34
13667	3713	Books are meant to entertain readers, why not just do that	35
13668	3713	So yes, take the offensive books off and there will be no problems.	36
13669	3715	Censorship     In everyday life we see stuff that we think is appropriate and should be romoved but do we have the right to be able to get that certain item off the shelfs to stop the sppread of this certain item, and is it safe for the future of kids not to see this kind of material in stores, librarys and book stores	0
13670	3715	Most cartoons have violence in them, matter of a fact almost all them do, every conflict is resulted to violence over a certain thing, kids sit down to watch these and not understand that there is violence in them, and understand that it is wrong not to be violent like they see on tv, some shows, movies are not right for kids	1
13671	3715	Same with books, now days kids get into newer books based off of movies, like twilight, these book series have violence in them and if parents had to censor what their kids could or could not read, most of these books would be off the shelf and won't be able to be viewed by anyone mostly kids	2
13672	3715	In newspapers there are violence shown, reported, or even been told, as a fact of kids safty if they saw it they would want to go and see if it still going on and to see it, kid safty is a high priority because we care about the future of them, on what they read, view, or even hear from books, tv, movies, and in newspapers	3
13673	3715	All these reasons are good enough to give parents some censorship on what their kids read, hear, and view on a daily bases, even if cartoons show violence, kids can watch them and enjoy them, but not act the violence shown in the cartoons and be saying some of the bad stuff it says in them.	4
13674	3716	Should libraries remove offensive reading material	0
13675	3716	No, I don't think certain reading material should be removed from libraries just @CAPS4 some people find @CAPS5 offensive	1
13676	3716	There's offensive material everywhere	2
13677	3716	Just because you find @CAPS5 offensive doesn't mean someone else does	3
13678	3716	In my opinion if a person finds something offensive they shouldn't look at @CAPS5 or read @CAPS5	4
13679	3716	A few months ago I was at the library	5
13680	3716	I was trying to find a book to read for an essay I had to write	6
13681	3716	I over heard two girls talking	7
13682	3716	They were arguing about something	8
13683	3716	I moved closer to them so I could hear	9
13684	3716	'@CAPS1's this one about?' The girl asked	10
13685	3716	'That's a really good book	11
13686	3716	@CAPS5's about these two people who fall in love and their love lives	12
13687	3716	@CAPS5 goes on to talk about how the man tries to find a woman after the girl he fell in love with dies, and about his love life after @CAPS6's gone.' The other girl said	13
13688	3716	'So you're saying @CAPS5's about sex?' The first girl asked	14
13689	3716	'@CAPS2, but only slightly.' The other girl answered	15
13690	3716	'I'm not going to read this!' The first girl said	16
13691	3716	'@CAPS3 why not?' The second girl asked, confused	17
13692	3716	'@CAPS4 @CAPS5 talks about sex	18
13693	3716	Teens shouldn't be able to check out books like this.' The first girl answered, '@CAPS5 sends the wrong message.' @CAPS6 added	19
13694	3716	After those girls left I went and got the book they were talking about	20
13695	3716	I started reading @CAPS5	21
13696	3716	Intresting	22
13697	3716	Actually, @CAPS5 was a very good book	23
13698	3716	The second girl was right	24
13699	3716	@CAPS5 wasn't mainly about sex	25
13700	3716	@CAPS5 was mostly about the love those two people shared for each other and @CAPS1 the man went through after his love died	26
13701	3716	That got me thinking	27
13702	3716	Should certain reading material be removed because @CAPS5 talks about sex, drugs, murders, ect or @CAPS4 someone finds @CAPS5 offensive	28
13703	3716	No, @CAPS5 shouldn't	29
13704	3716	There's offensive material in real life and @CAPS5's not being removed	30
13705	3716	Why should @CAPS5 be removed from a library	31
13706	3716	@CAPS1's @CAPS5 matter if @CAPS5's in a book	32
13707	3716	There is always going to be something somewhere that offends someone	33
13708	3716	That's just how life is.	34
13709	3717	Should books, music, etc	0
13710	3717	be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	1
13711	3717	well people have the right to look at what they want, to hear what they want	2
13712	3717	Some think its not right to have offensive things out in the open on the shelves.Some people think its alright	3
13713	3717	I gusse it all just depends on that person and thier feelings	4
13714	3717	Lets say i was in the library and i did see  something offensive	5
13715	3717	well the world does not stop and say ''hey look at that @ORGANIZATION1 finds that offensive so lets take that off the shelves just to please her''	6
13716	3717	Am sorry but thats not how life works	7
13717	3717	If you dont like looking at it then turn the  other way	8
13718	3717	If it were me i would be worried about more important things such as war or things going  on in my life other then something offensive on the book shelves	9
13719	3717	Its a big world out there and it is not getting any smaller and it is not going anywhere anytime soon	10
13720	3717	There are going to be things in life we the people dont like to look at, to maybe hear thats offensive	11
13721	3717	Heres what i say to it, get over it 	12
13722	3717	The other  day i was at the bait shop and i heared a word that  i dare not to even  say and i hate hearing that word	13
13723	3717	What was i going to do tell a grown man to not say that?.....	14
13724	3717	I just  rolled my eyes and went on about my  buisness	15
13725	3717	Should books, music, ect	16
13726	3717	be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	17
13727	3717	well like ive  been saying this whole time, in live there are going to be certain things that are offensive to you	18
13728	3717	You have to get over it 	19
13729	3717	Sometimes geting over offensive things that you see are not easy but hey lifes not  easy	20
13730	3718	If I found a book that offendide me i would have to go and take it off the shealf because if I find that a book is offensive i know that others would think the same	0
13731	3718	I agre some books can be offensive to some and not to others and its really not fare for thows who think that way	1
13732	3718	One reason that i would take it for that shelf would be to keep youn childern form reading it	2
13733	3718	Parents dont really want there childern reading about vilence and murdare	3
13734	3718	Most of what I would take off the shelf would have to be about people being racist agents another person or people	4
13735	3718	people killing others and be doing sexaule things	5
13736	3718	People really shouldent read things like that because it puts things in there heads and somtimes make the think the same way as the writer	6
13737	3718	If childern read books about vilence and sexaule actions they could think that its ok to do these things to other people and get in to alot of trouble with the law and there parents	7
13738	3718	Children really need to be keped way from these kinda of books, tell there older and undersdtande whats right and whats wrong	8
13739	3718	Some books have alot of cursing in them and alot of childern pick up on words and start using them more and more tell it becomes a habbit	9
13740	3718	Evern thow some books are of real people they should still be taken off the shealfs	10
13741	3718	In some of these books there is alot of vilence and childern should not be exsposed to that kinda of book     Books can sometimes be more bad then good	11
13742	3718	If everbody had there way and could take a book that offendid them off the shealf whenever they wanted then there would be no books left.	12
13743	3719	If a people want to remove books, movies, music, magazines, and exetra then they will if they feel it is offensive to others	0
13744	3719	I wish they would not ,but they feel the need to take things off the shelves if so	1
13745	3719	They feel that if someone can find some kind of offensive thing then they will feel it is okay to say or do thoughs things that they read or hear	2
13746	3719	It also commine sence to not do thoughs things that people wrote about	3
13747	3719	The auther's wright things to intertane and to egicate us about things that where okay in the time peroid that the story in this case was okay back then	4
13748	3719	Most people these day take things way to serous now mostly because we have things like lawsuits and dercrimation	5
13749	3719	If someone can find something to complane about they will do so	6
13750	3719	if there is a book out there that is about back in the day when @CAPS1's had slave's and if there calling them a name that is not very nice	7
13751	3719	Then someone and complain and say that it is rashal and there will be a disbute about it and the auther will most likely loose and have to change that word into something els	8
13752	3719	People do not relise how much this happens it happens a lot expeshally with books	9
13753	3719	Movies are a whole different thing now the things that happen on the movies get away with it mostly because they have money to get away with	10
13754	3719	There is a reason why things are @CAPS9 @CAPS2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, and @CAPS4	11
13755	3719	@CAPS2 is for children under the age @NUM1	12
13756	3719	There are serten things that can be in though's movies	13
13757	3719	@CAPS2 @NUM1 there can be a lot more things it can be scarry to an extent and there also sometimes sexual things ,but they do not show the whole thing	14
13758	3719	There also can be villons and some swaring not a lot though	15
13759	3719	@CAPS9 @CAPS4 that's a whole new level they can have anything they really want and its a little more than @CAPS2 @NUM1 they kind of have a little more graphic than @CAPS2 @NUM1	16
13760	3719	Sometimes they have to choose between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @CAPS9 @CAPS4 it depends on how graphic things are	17
13761	3719	Music is a whole other thing depending on what kind of music you are lissening to like theres @CAPS11, @CAPS4 & @CAPS13, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS17, and exedra	18
13762	3719	with all thoughs they talk about sex and volints	19
13763	3719	Now all of them excepent contry talk about drugs and @ORGANIZATION1 talks about @ORGANIZATION1	20
13764	3719	There are some that talks about more things, but most of them thats what they talk about	21
13765	3719	If perents do not want there childeren lissening to it then they do not lissen	22
13766	3719	there are ways of still lissening to it	23
13767	3719	most radio stations they can not swre on the radio, but they just cut it out	24
13768	3719	there are ways to have the uncut version, but thats on a @CAPS18, @CAPS19, or @CAPS20 @NUM7 player	25
13769	3719	There are ways to get around it	26
13770	3719	See i think that it is dumb to take things like that away mostly, because they are going to see or hear about it someday anyways expeshally when they are in high school	27
13771	3719	Most teens do things with out there parents knowing and when they start driving they can lissen to whatever they want	28
13772	3719	Also they can read anything they want too, because they can buy the book and read it and hid it	29
13773	3719	Face it kids even younger find ways to do things that their parents do not want them to do	30
13774	3719	Matter what age they are they find ways to do what they want if they want it bad enoff	31
13775	3719	I think if a school wants to read something than they should have to have parents exent about it and if the kids can not read it than they can do something els insted or read something els	32
13776	3719	Do not take thing off the shelve just, because a couple of students can read or watch it	33
13777	3719	Your spoilling it for the kids that want to and can it is really unfair to the rest of the students they can not hepl it that there parents wont let them	34
13778	3719	If the parents won't then try to talk to them and tell them about it help them understand	35
13779	3719	Also people should have to watch what they do just because theres a kid the parent should leave them with a babysiter or something.	36
13780	3720	Books That Are Offensive     @CAPS1 view point is that books should not be taken off the shelfs if taken offensive to one person	0
13781	3720	Sometimes people get help from books that are offensive to others because somebody is doing something wrong and the book @MONTH1 help the other person	1
13782	3720	Everybody should be able to read a book if they want in a library	2
13783	3720	In a library everybody should have the right to read every book	3
13784	3720	The idea of taking a book off the shelf is a bad because people want to read books like that	4
13785	3720	Some people have a problem with that type of book but if they don't like it then tell people not to read it not take it off the shelf	5
13786	3720	If anything put it in a different area or just move it put all that type of book in one area not mixed in	6
13787	3720	When people need help they read a book or look it up	7
13788	3720	So if the book is offensive but can help somebody with problems then don't even move it	8
13789	3720	People do have a reason to read books that are offensive	9
13790	3720	We don't know all of the reasons but there are alot of them	10
13791	3720	If a movie is not good for children or just very horid it @MONTH1 need to be put in a place where nobody will look	11
13792	3720	Kids and grown ups are the same and nobody needs to see a movie if it is really bad	12
13793	3720	Usually when somebody takes something offensive they are guilty of something and know they are but will not admit it	13
13794	3720	People think other people write things that are just offensive on purpose ,but they don't they write it and somebody is guilty if something and can not live up to it	14
13795	3720	Sometimes just the reading is read wrong and misunderstood	15
13796	3720	Everybody has had a book that they thought was offensive but then the next person read it and they might think it is funny	16
13797	3720	The biggest problem is some people can't read	17
13798	3720	then some people read so fast they do not comprehend it correctly	18
13799	3720	I don't feel like them certain materials should be taken off the shelf if found offensive because that person @MONTH1 be feeling guilty of something	19
13800	3720	If the materials should be moved they should just be moved to a different area not off of the shelves totally	20
13801	3720	If it is taken offensive they should tell the librarian and then if very many more people say it is offensive then it can be taken off the shelf.	21
13802	3721	The belief of certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are offensive, depends on the situation the material is relating to	0
13803	3721	If one wants to see these type of resources, then he/she must be mature enough to withstand it	1
13804	3721	It all depends on where the material is at in the library and what situation it's in	2
13805	3721	If it is in the children's area, I highly suggest that it should be removed from there, since it's clear that a child should not process this type of information	3
13806	3721	If it's in the teen section, then the person must be mature enough to take this sort of inappropriate matter or just leave it be	4
13807	3721	In the adult section however, there should be no argument of any sort because it is obvious that the person must be fully mature to take in this sort of material	5
13808	3721	One example on why this sort of aspect on whether or not inappropriate material should be removed are the comic books called '@CAPS1 tales' or '@CAPS2 the @ORGANIZATION1'	6
13809	3721	These type of materials have some from inappropriate to disturbing events in the books, but have been distributed to the teen section	7
13810	3721	Now from ages @NUM1 years of age usually spend their time there and would likely read this type of information	8
13811	3721	Some teens would be horrified of looking through these books and others would be fascinated by it	9
13812	3721	It varies through the people and what type of material they would like to read	10
13813	3721	It all depends on the situation where this material is distributed in	11
13814	3721	Another example on whether or not inappropraite material should be taken out of the shelves is how movies are put in situations	12
13815	3721	There was once a time, a young lady around her early teens who wanted to check out a type of movie in which she have never saw before	13
13816	3721	So once she checked it out, she watched it with her parents and saw some uneasy sections during this movie	14
13817	3721	The person should have thought this through before jumping into the situation	15
13818	3721	If the person was mature enough to go through this matter, it would have been fine	16
13819	3721	but she was young still and so it made the matter worse	17
13820	3721	Whether or not inappropriate material should be removed from shelves depends on how and where the material is distributed and so it shows that one person can change the difference in the situation.Therefore whether this type of material should be taken off the shelves depends, once again, on the situation it is at	18
13821	3722	Books, music, movies, magazines, we've all had the pleasure of seeing/reading/watching our favorites, but many are considered unsatisfactory in their content to younger children	0
13822	3722	Parents, now than ever, are concerned about how their children are raised, and are always looking to clear inappropriate things away from their lives	1
13823	3722	Things with heavy violence, gore, language and even scenes of sexual content, all of these are wanted by all parents to be censored from their childs' eyes	2
13824	3722	There are many reasons why parents worldwide wish to hide these things from the eyes of the young, such as	3
13825	3722	personal influence, emotional growth and even the chance of a child becoming disobedient to the parent	4
13826	3722	These are all valid reasons why some things should be removed from the public eye	5
13827	3722	Again, we've all read or heard things that affect us personally, maybe you read on how you can make your life happier, or maybe you heard an inspirational song that conviced you to follow your dreams	6
13828	3722	Well, this is also true for everyday books, movies, magazines or music	7
13829	3722	If someone is introduced to something telling of a life with hatred or someone living in a violent way, it can influence a young reader to wish to live the same style of life if it sounds even a little remotely fun	8
13830	3722	True, children are encouraged to have fun, but to a certain, but safe extent	9
13831	3722	These are even known to affect someone's emotions	10
13832	3722	Maybe a great song that made you happy, or a movie that made you laugh	11
13833	3722	But it is true the opposite way as well	12
13834	3722	Songs that are dark and have a gloomy feeling to them can make a person feel depressed, or a scary movie @MONTH1 leave a person with a new fear or a nightmare in their sleep the same night	13
13835	3722	It has even been known that some children are left traumatized for life just because they weren't ready for what they saw in certain violent and gorey scenes	14
13836	3722	These are all things that parents want to keep away from their children in order to keep them safe	15
13837	3722	People are very easily moved by any form of information, song and story alike	16
13838	3722	It is our responsibility to keep the good influences around and keep the bad ones away	17
13839	3722	Children are easily affected in behavior, maybe they just saw a movie of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and thought he was so cool and they wanted to be just like him	18
13840	3722	If a child is exposed to a movie of great violence or bad influence, the child @MONTH1 then start following what happened in it and begin not listening to their parents	19
13841	3722	It is only right to keep these bad influences away until they are able to handle things so violent or misfortunate	20
13842	3722	So yes, certain materials should be taken away from the public eye, for the safety of the community and for its' children	21
13843	3722	Books, movies, music, magazines - We've all seen/read/listened to them, but what have they influenced on you	22
13844	3722	Have you become a better person for doing so	23
13845	3722	Or a worse one	24
13846	3722	Or maybe you weren't affected at all	25
13847	3722	We need to be careful about what is available to us and to the rest of the world	26
13848	3722	Keeping the bad things away from our children and from anyone who can be influenced in a negative way is a top priority for any one person, group or business.	27
13849	3723	Newspaper staff and/or whom it @MONTH1 concern,      Reading material found in a library is very useful and informative to the world, there is no limit to what could be found on paper	0
13850	3723	Whether it be offensive or not, having limits to books will only create tension, effect the economy, and will lead to illegal activity, ironically enough, in which offensive books will be written and sold, completely undercover	1
13851	3723	In today's world, it would be nearly impossible to pick up a book and factually state that it is not offensive	2
13852	3723	Almost everyone has some little issue with something in the world today, and because of that, original and unoffensive material are hard to come by	3
13853	3723	With the stripping of offensive material from libraries, authors will be devastated, not just emotionally, but will be out of a job and will have less income	4
13854	3723	Because of how virtually impossible it is to write a book that is not offensive, authors will become very frustrated, and most are very passionate about what they do	5
13855	3723	Also, because almost all reading material is offensive in some way, there will be little to no reading material on the selves of the world or nation's libraries	6
13856	3723	@CAPS1 could potentially lead to violent protests that quickly tear down even the most successful of nations	7
13857	3723	However, physical devastation would not be the only toll paid for the stripping of offensive reading material from libraries      Books cost money	8
13858	3723	to make books costs money, to buy books costs money	9
13859	3723	Paper companies would take a major nose-dive in the market, having almost no clientel	10
13860	3723	When a major divistion such as the paper industry falls, it will bring others down as @CAPS2, and due to the nation's market complexity, almost all major companies rely on paper	11
13861	3723	@CAPS1 would ruin the economy	12
13862	3723	Some might say, '@CAPS1 means that the people of @LOCATION1 will be much more green!' @CAPS2, the past few centuries when economics and the environment are put on a scale, economics takes the cake by a mile	13
13863	3723	Obviously, @CAPS1 will do much more harm than good	14
13864	3723	The people of the world always have a priority	15
13865	3723	Also, the majority of the people don't enjoy having something taken that they have grown so fond to	16
13866	3723	People, in general, want what they can't have	17
13867	3723	An obvious example would be illegal drugs	18
13868	3723	the drug market is extremely successful, but it's illegal	19
13869	3723	If people were to have these currently illegal drugs for their use, being completely legal, chances are that the success of drug marketing will plummet	20
13870	3723	The opposite situation for books: We have them now, but when they are taken, we will want them even more	21
13871	3723	People who read tend to be very passionate about literature and very intellegent	22
13872	3723	All it takes is one group to gain numbers, and have a very talented speaker persuede others to follow in a potentially violent revolt to be given back permission to write and publish alleged 'offensive' books	23
13873	3723	All other material found in libraries, such as music and movies, being taken away will have the same effects, give or take a few similarities or differences	24
13874	3723	Avoiding such problems is easy, keep the books and all other material in a library on the shelves	25
13875	3723	It will only be problematic to take it all away, especially for being offensive, when there are very few books that the general population will find not offensive	26
13876	3723	If keeping the material in libraries means individuals will become offended for very different reasons, let it be organized chaos	27
13877	3723	@CAPS1 is how people work, and keeping the material on the selves is how the people are pleased or motivated	28
13878	3725	Hello my name is @PERSON1 one day me and a friend were in the librairy on @DATE1 @TIME1 looking at some books	0
13879	3725	Later that day my @CAPS1 and I were at school reading our books she came up to me in the hallway	1
13880	3725	@CAPS1 said that her book was offensive and she was going to tell somebody about it	2
13881	3725	So school went by the bell rang it was time to go	3
13882	3725	When she got home she went and told her parents he parents said that she should go and tell the librarian	4
13883	3725	On our walk to the librairy @CAPS1 and I stopped at the store to get something to drink	5
13884	3725	While were were there she got a newspapaer to read about what was going on at the scool when she noticed something about books about how they needed to be taken off the shelf	6
13885	3725	when we walked in the doors to the library the librarian was sitting at her desk she asked us if we needed any help	7
13886	3725	@CAPS1 said no but I need to talk to you about a book the librarian said she was way ahead of her	8
13887	3725	That she had already had complaints about the books and she was taking them off the shelfs	9
13888	3725	And moving the to the back closet	10
13889	3725	About a week or so later @CAPS1 and her mother were reading the newspaper about the library it said that all the offensive books were being taken off the shelf and they were replacing them with newer and better ones	11
13890	3725	Some people thought it was wrong and they shouldnt do it because of one person said it was offensive but they did it any way.	12
13891	3726	Censorship helps prevent people from viewing, listening, or read disturbing images or ideas for certain age groups	0
13892	3726	But in the case of libraries, all the books would have to be taken off the shelves	1
13893	3726	And if all the books are taken off the shelves, then all the books in stores would have to be thrown out as well	2
13894	3726	Books are essential part of life	3
13895	3726	They have great ideas and thoughts expressed through these amazing pieces of word art	4
13896	3726	People who think that the books in libraries should be censored, are fools	5
13897	3726	These people want to keep their children and themselves safe, and that is understandable, but at the same time they are hurting people with the decision they have decided to put forth	6
13898	3726	Authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored	7
13899	3726	People who enjoy reading the books, that are wanted censored, would no longer be able to read those books	8
13900	3726	It is mainly the choice of the person to avoid these books if they truely find it offensive to themselves	9
13901	3726	They should not go all out of their way and try to censor them, because they would eventually might cause everyone or some people to think that they could find a book that should be censored	10
13902	3726	And if that happens, then there would be no more books on the shelves	11
13903	3726	The government will take notice and ban these books or worse remove all books forever just like what happened in @CAPS1 @NUM1	12
13904	3726	Over all, books are a good thing	13
13905	3726	They gives us inspiration, and help us pull through life with the thoughts expressed in them	14
13906	3726	It is your choice to avoid the books that upset you, not what other people think about them.	15
13907	3727	Do I believe that ceertain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
13908	3727	NO, the reason I say that is because if it was offensive to me,they might not be offensive to other people	1
13909	3727	Im not saying things like that are offensive to me because there not	2
13910	3727	I personaly love reading books like comic books with super heros in them	3
13911	3727	That excites me	4
13912	3727	Back to the point if people thinks a book is offensive to them then they don'@CAPS1 need to pick it up	5
13913	3727	If I knew a book would be offensive to me I would never pick it up	6
13914	3727	I know what your going to say 'but what if they didn'@CAPS1 know it was going to be offensive to them'	7
13915	3727	Well thats a gud question	8
13916	3727	Just put it up and dont complain because the writer didn'@CAPS1 know you were gonig to take it offensive or the wrong way	9
13917	3727	They were just writing a book	10
13918	3727	It's not the writers fault	11
13919	3727	He or she was just probable writing a book that they though was a good book	12
13920	3727	When it got published and you read it and you took it offensive	13
13921	3727	DON'@CAPS1 because they exspecing there self's	14
13922	3727	So dont take no book's off the shelf's in the libraries because stupid people wont to get mad  beacause they took it offensive	15
13923	3727	Your going to ruin it for the other people that though the book was either a good book or an azsome book	16
13924	3727	So now that we got that out of the way lets move on and get on with our life's	17
13925	3727	Thanks for the conversation	18
13926	3727	See you next	19
13927	3728	Society is always dealing with what is appropriate and what is not	0
13928	3728	We witness things of that nature every day even when we are not trying to	1
13929	3728	It is the classic argument between two parties trying to prove eachother wrong, what is admissable and what is not	2
13930	3728	We should try with all our efforts to keep inapporpriate books off of our shelves and out of the hands of the young population	3
13931	3728	People can be influenced to do just about anything	4
13932	3728	There are too many of these tales to pick out even one	5
13933	3728	The interesting thing is people can be affected by someone indirectly	6
13934	3728	Whether it be through television, music, or books, man can be molded into something through what they are conditioned to believe	7
13935	3728	The influences one encounters can be either positive or negative	8
13936	3728	As a lowly person who only wants what is best for society, I know that movies with criminal acts or explicit images do not help anyone become a better citizen	9
13937	3728	It is no different with books	10
13938	3728	Books that have politically incorrect messages are in no sense better than movies that achieve the same goal	11
13939	3728	I am not in any way against reading books, rather I am quite on the contrary	12
13940	3728	Reading is overall good for mental and social health because it allows us to explore things deep inside of us that are often rendered useless in our fast-paced world	13
13941	3728	But if one is constantly overexposed to books that are against our very human nature, they should be removed for the good of the people around us	14
13942	3728	If one cannot find a book to read that is not deemed appropriate, then he or she needs to take a look at themselves	15
13943	3728	There are millions of books that are not only exciting and stimulating but also can have a positive influence on one as well	16
13944	3728	We as members of the @ORGANIZATION1 are already in enough trouble as it is with all our financial troubles and what not	17
13945	3728	We do not need to add more to the table when we let the population gain access to obsene books that would typically make someone only rebellious to society	18
13946	3728	If something is making the people of our lands more riotous than it should immediately be censored or removed from society in general	19
13947	3728	Believe it or not, there are ways to have fun and get a good message across at the same time!	20
13948	3729	Dear Newspaper	0
13949	3729	In libraries I do not feel it is neccasry to take stuff away that poeple could find offensive, because honestly if it offends you than don't look at it	1
13950	3729	You are your own person and can make your own decisions, if this so called offensive material is not veiwed offensive by someone	2
13951	3729	Then why should that person be  punished by someone who has to make a big deal out of something	3
13952	3729	Just because you don't like it doesn't mean I don't like it	4
13953	3729	If someone finds a book offensive then don't read it, if there is a magazine that you find offensive, don't read it	5
13954	3729	It is as simple as that, people are wise enough to know what is good and what is bad for them	6
13955	3729	There is no reason why someone can't choose what they want to get, where they want it	7
13956	3729	From observations of my own I have seen numerous times when someone has found someones music offensive, but they don't say anything	8
13957	3729	They just ignore it, the world needs more people like that	9
13958	3729	More people who will stand up for what they believe in and won't judge others for what they belief in	10
13959	3729	It seems as if the world is becoming filled with a bunch of people who care way to much about what other people are doing	11
13960	3729	That is not a bad thing nessaccarily but everyone will be offended by something but it is your choice to whether or not let it bug you for the rest of your life	12
13961	3729	Listen to what ever music, read what ever books or magazines that you want	13
13962	3729	If someone finds them offensive, so be it	14
13963	3729	You are your own person and that won't ever change	15
13964	3729	Do what makes you happy and nothing else.	16
13965	3730	Why censor things	0
13966	3730	When there's always going to be someone out there wanting to read a book or magizine that others think should be censored	1
13967	3730	If this visious circle would continue then we wouldn't have any books left at all to read	2
13968	3730	Theres lots of things out there that some people dont like but that doesn't give them the right to take it off the self	3
13969	3730	Then by doing that and taking it off the self just because they didnt think it was an apropriate book	4
13970	3730	Will leave someone with nothing to read now	5
13971	3730	If the books or magazine would start being taken off the selves then we would have less ways to research or learn certain things	6
13972	3730	Even though there might be graphic pictures or writing in books or magazines doesn't make them inaproprieate	7
13973	3730	It needs to be labled on the book that it has it in there	8
13974	3730	If you see the mark and you dont want to look at it then you dont have too	9
13975	3730	We need to code books for different ages	10
13976	3730	Then parents could be happy if there little boy or girl could only read certain books because of how old they are	11
13977	3730	Then if parents give permission then children could read books that were ment for older kids or adults	12
13978	3730	Even though im not the biggest fan of reading but i will sometimes pick up a book that has things for me to learn in it about an engine	13
13979	3730	I dont think that people should be able to restrict anything and take it off the selves everyone has there own right to read the book or watch the movie, etc	14
13980	3730	But children are different because they dont need to learn all those things at an early age	15
13981	3730	So parents can pick what they can read	16
13982	3730	but if your an adult you should be able to read, listen, or watch whatever you want to.	17
13983	3731	There are many things in this world that childeren should not see and that poisen the minds of them and others whatever age they @MONTH1 be	0
13984	3731	The things people see these days can be bad and shouln't be seen by anybody of any age	1
13985	3731	These things should be disposed of so our minds will be clean and the minds of future generations will be clean also	2
13986	3731	The reason that I think that no one of any age should think about these bad things is because if kids shouldn't know about them than, then why should the same kid that has grown up know these same thing	3
13987	3731	But if things like this are in libraries thenthe question is who should be in charge of deciding what is right for wroung	4
13988	3731	Sence the worlds population is so large and so many people have diferent ideas then how could we get one person to look through all things and decide between good or bad	5
13989	3731	Well the awnser would be that it is impossible to	6
13990	3731	That is why it is up to the head of the family to decide what to do about this crisis.	7
13991	3732	I believe that some materials should not be on the selfs, but not removed.They should have a room with everything that someone could offened anyone.Some books	0
13992	3732	music, movies, magazines,and etc	1
13993	3732	should not be totally removed from a public library	2
13994	3732	I have seen a little kid pull a adult book of the self.The mother got very mad at the library for having it so low, on the self.I can understand some books being in the library.They should have all the adult book and etc	3
13995	3732	on the higher selfs so the little kids can not reach them.The library should have a room for only kids, and teenagers books	4
13996	3732	magazines, music, movies and etc	5
13997	3732	The kids should not be aloud in parts of the library that are to vilont , or sexual.The library should also have a room for all the adult movies and books with a locked door,along with the kid room.If the library does not have enough money for the rooms, they can atleast put all of the adult stuff on a top self or higher self	6
13998	3732	I believe that some materials should not be on the shelfs,but not removed from the library.Because, someone might need that book to research something for school or a job.It could also take someones history out of the library if it is removed.I mean there is a reason the book	7
13999	3732	movie, magazine, music,or etc	8
14000	3732	was made.There is a reason that the material is there.Also the parents can help the library, by keeping a closer eye on their kids.Watch what the grab off the self.The parent can even have a friend or neighbor watch the children while the parent goes to the library so the kids wont see anything the shouldn't	9
14001	3732	I believe everything i have wrote here is the truth about the way things should be in a public library.The adult stuff should be higher up.If a parent doesnt like it they can leave their kid at home,or not go to that library anymore.	10
14002	3733	There are many kinds of books, music, movies, and magazines in one library	0
14003	3733	People all over the world have different interests in differtent subjects	1
14004	3733	Some people take offence to certain books, songs, movies, magazines, etc	2
14005	3733	Another person @MONTH1 not and think its offencive at all	3
14006	3733	For example, a religous book that talks about @CAPS1 being one guy when some people beleive differently	4
14007	3733	The book should not be put away, for there are also books that will be all about your beliefs	5
14008	3733	The variety of subjects in a library such as songs, magazines and everything else in the library is huge	6
14009	3733	There should never be a book, movie, or item removed when one person takes offence to it because in Katherine Paterson quote, its makin the point if someone decides they want to remove a book from the shelf anyone could	7
14010	3733	Which eventually would leave people with no variety in books which would start a huge problem	8
14011	3733	People would not be able to read as much as they'd like because they would not have the ability to pick between many options	9
14012	3733	The library provides information for teachers, students, researchers, writers and for readers who do it as a hobby	10
14013	3733	If that was takin away from people, the people would become less informed about many things in the world	11
14014	3733	In @CAPS2 freedom is important and we expect it, freedom of speech and the freedom to have your own opinions and interests	12
14015	3733	Therefor if items were being removed from a public place that gives that, @CAPS2 would not let this happen	13
14016	3733	People have the right to like whatever they want, if someone takes offence to an item in the library they should walk away from it and not stress about removing it	14
14017	3735	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves because little kids shouldn't be watching: seeing: or hearing them	0
14018	3735	Vielence is not a good thing for little kids to be watching because they will want to grow up and fight	1
14019	3735	We already have a high teen vielence rate	2
14020	3735	Our teen vielence rate really needs to be lowered	3
14021	3735	When teens start to fight they don't have control of themselves	4
14022	3735	The movies in my oppion need to really be removed because that is how children are learning to fight	5
14023	3735	They see an older kid fighting and they want to try it out	6
14024	3735	Movies are a bad influnes on little kids when it comes to fighting and killing	7
14025	3735	Movies could also get kids to be bullies	8
14026	3735	When a kid is a bullie they don't really know what they are getting themselves into	9
14027	3735	Another bad example would be drugs and alchoale	10
14028	3735	Teens and other children get put into peer prushior	11
14029	3735	When teens and other children have peer prushior its hard to say NO	12
14030	3735	The kinds of music people listen to	13
14031	3735	Music could also be a bad influence on kids	14
14032	3735	The music that kids listen to would have something about killing, drugs, and alchoale	15
14033	3735	When kids get involved in drugs and alchoale that will mess up their whole life	16
14034	3735	For example the screamo music to me sounds like someone would be killing or beating up someone	17
14035	3735	Magazines are a bad thing for teens and children to be looking at and reading	18
14036	3735	Magazines have bad imangs in them and when teens see the imangs they want to act and or be just like the people that are in them pictures	19
14037	3735	Books, movies, music and magazines should be removed from the shelves because of all the vielence	20
14038	3735	There are so many different fights and different teens that get other kids into peer prushior	21
14039	3735	That is why im persuativing you to take the books off the shelves	22
14040	3736	How much hurt can someone take from a book, popular music, a movie, or even a magazine, etc.	0
14041	3736	Well, as shown by studies, @CAPS1 ctizens @MONTH1 take what these items say more offensivley than what it @MONTH1 seem	1
14042	3736	They @MONTH1 seem to go overboard or exaggerate what these updated articles are spreading across @LOCATION1, but is it really true	2
14043	3736	Due to all the diffrent races @LOCATION1 sees every single day, sometimes we @MONTH1 @CAPS2 be doing our best to accept their diffrent cultural backrounds in our modern day society	3
14044	3736	I have noticed just by going to a pretty much all white school how most people judge other races other than their own, wheather it be making fun of what they wear or how they talk, etc	4
14045	3736	Sometimes I wish they could just consider that we are all human beings and no one deserves to be treated that way	5
14046	3736	Taking this all into consideration, I think that wheather or @CAPS2 they are racial books, magazines, or movies they should @CAPS2 be removed from there distribution around the world	6
14047	3736	I know that wheather or @CAPS2 that these books, movies, magazines, or music are racial they should still be able to be heard by those who want to hear it	7
14048	3736	I think that there are some people out there, for example myself, who like to watch movies and read books about slavery, the holocaust, etc	8
14049	3736	It's a part of @CAPS1 @CAPS4 and I enjoy learning about it very much	9
14050	3736	It @MONTH1 seem racial though to those who went through these hard times and these items which try to explain the pain these people went through @MONTH1 just seem like a joke towards them to make fun of all they went through, eventhough it is @CAPS2 meant that way at all	10
14051	3736	I also understand that there are people who write books about mexican jokes, black jokes, etc	11
14052	3736	or even make comedy movies joking over diffent races	12
14053	3736	These types of things I think should be taken OFF the shelves everywhere	13
14054	3736	These are the types of things that I feel are what bother many different races and make fun of their cultural backround	14
14055	3736	When it comes to music these days, it seems they always sing about love, being hurt physically and mentally, and so on	15
14056	3736	I feel like music shouldn't really have an affect on diffrent races, unless it is purposley made for the reason of making fun of people	16
14057	3736	I don't see where magazines can be harmful to a certain cultural backround	17
14058	3736	The magazines I read about aka seventeen magazine seem to comment about how beautiful these people	18
14059	3736	Overall, I think that making fun of diffrent races around the world is never going to get better if we never do anything to help it get better	19
14060	3736	Eventhough all these diffrent items such as: movies, magazines, books and music @MONTH1 seem racial I think they should be left on the shelf of every library to let people watch and understand more about the @CAPS4 of our world, but if it is a truly written book, song, movie, or magazine article that is aimed to hurt someone of a diffent race, that should definatley be removed from every shelf around the world	20
14061	3737	Should books that are offensive be removed from library shelves	0
14062	3737	Some books in the library are offensive to some people but should the books be removed from the shelves	1
14063	3737	I personally don't think the books should be removed	2
14064	3737	Some people @MONTH1 think the books do need to be removed some don't	3
14065	3737	What is your choice to this difficult question	4
14066	3737	First off as I said before I don't think the books should be removed	5
14067	3737	but some people @MONTH1 not like my opinion	6
14068	3737	These books should not be removed just because they are offensive to other people	7
14069	3737	If another finds any book offensive that person should just ignore the book, not asked for it to be taken off the shelf	8
14070	3737	someone else might want to read that same book but if it is taken off the shelf then that person can't read the book	9
14071	3737	It isn't fair to take books off the shelf just because someone finds the book offensive	10
14072	3737	Any person that finds a book offensive should just ignore it and not read the book	11
14073	3737	That book that is offensive to someone isn't directed to he or she	12
14074	3737	the authors opinion shouldn't matter	13
14075	3737	Second, everyones opinion is different	14
14076	3737	Some people want the books off the shelves some people don't	15
14077	3737	So who gets their way in this little arguement	16
14078	3737	I think the books should stay on the shelves	17
14079	3737	One person @MONTH1 find the book offensive and the next person @MONTH1 not	18
14080	3737	Other people @MONTH1 not even read the offensive book	19
14081	3737	But no matter if the book is read or not it shouldn't be taken off the shelf	20
14082	3737	it just isn't fair to all the other people who actually do want to read that book	21
14083	3737	Lastly, everyone enjoys different book themes	22
14084	3737	If you don't like the theme of the book then why are you reading it	23
14085	3737	If you don't like the book or you find it offensive go choose another book	24
14086	3737	Don't make it to where other people can't read the book if they like those kind of themes	25
14087	3737	You wouldn't like it if that happened to you	26
14088	3737	No one would like that	27
14089	3737	Just pick a book that has a theme you like	28
14090	3737	So as you can see I don't think it is fair that books get taken off the shelf if people find the book offensive	29
14091	3737	Some people @MONTH1 like that theme of the book or the story it has to it	30
14092	3737	Some people have different opinions of the book or it means something different to them	31
14093	3737	And just because someone finds a book offensive doesn't mean it should be taken off the shelf	32
14094	3737	it just isn't fair to other people.	33
14095	3738	Have you ever read a book you thought was offense	0
14096	3738	Have you ever read a book you didn't want any one else to read	1
14097	3738	I agree with katherine paterson if we can take one book off the shelfs we can take all the books of the shelf	2
14098	3738	Katherine Paterson says if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that I abhor	3
14099	3738	Which  means that if one person takes a book off the shelf then so does everone else then we will have no books to read at libraries	4
14100	3738	This is why I agree with katherine on this subject books are wrote for us to read not to be sensored just because so stuck up parent doesn't want their kid reading some book that so many other people enjoy	5
14101	3738	Magizines that people think are offense then the should put in a differnt area so the kids cant get them	6
14102	3738	The same with movies so movies are not ment for kids, but that doesn't mean that we have to take them off the shelf	7
14103	3738	One thing we can do is put the valgur moves that we dont want are children watching behind the counter and have the libraian get them when we watch them	8
14104	3738	As far as for the books make a separte part of the library for books that kids shouldn't read, such as romance or horror books, adult books, some action books	9
14105	3738	Music is another thing that some parents have a had time with because of the offense lyrics in them, but some poeple like that kind of music so we can't take that away from them because we don't like it	10
14106	3738	does that seem fair?	11
14107	3738	Now does some of those books seem a little better now	12
14108	3738	Yes we still dont want are kids read valgur books about killing, and romance, and serial killers, but for some people enjoy  reading those novels	13
14109	3738	This is why i agree with Katherine @PERSON1	14
14110	3740	In Libraries there are many books, magazines, music, or movies that @MONTH1 be found offensive to many, but it might be what some people like to read	0
14111	3740	therefore we must keep all of the materials no matter how crude	1
14112	3740	These library materials are all part of the worlds past and all have a bigger story behind it which has an even bigger story behind it and so on	2
14113	3740	If we start removing books and everyone removes one then we are going to be left with nothing to learn off of	3
14114	3740	The world will be less intellegent and we start to forget and lose our past	4
14115	3740	This is the reason that we must never take any books, movies, music, or magizines off the shelves of a library for it @MONTH1 be special to someone or @MONTH1 be crude to others but it in the end they all contain some past that no other book @MONTH1 contain	5
14116	3740	A world with no so called innapropriate books, magazines, music, or movies would be a less crude place but it will be stripping people of knowledge that @MONTH1 be needed	6
14117	3740	If everyone took a book off the shelve than none would be left	7
14118	3740	The books would start to lose their love, compasssion, and livlyhood within them	8
14119	3740	Other books @MONTH1 contain segregation and segregation is a big part of americas past	9
14120	3740	The word negroe is offensive for some and if we took all of the books with the word negroe out than we would lose @NUM1 years of americas past that cannot be forgotten	10
14121	3740	Documents containing stories of wars, leaders, rising and fallsing of many empires and kingdoms would all be gone because the violance was to offensive	11
14122	3740	Many historic moments in the world's history woul.d be lost forever	12
14123	3740	We cannot get rid of offensive books for the sake of the world's past	13
14124	3740	The world would lose too much history in getting rid of offensive books	14
14125	3740	If the books were put in there own section in the library than kids would not be able to see them causing this to be no  problem for young eyes to see	15
14126	3740	If you find many books offensive than you just should not go to a library because no matter what happens no books are going to be just thrown away for they have history within them	16
14127	3740	If we start deshelving books than soon movies will be going and than magazines will be limited to only say so much	17
14128	3740	I believe that if our kids cannot get to the section with offensive books then we will not  have to worry about them seeing the offensive materials	18
14129	3740	If we want to keep all the books and people are still trying to throw away offensive books than we should just have a section where offensive books should be and kids cannot get to	19
14130	3740	In @CAPS1 this is how we could censor books in libraries	20
14131	3740	Books, Movies, Magazines, and music are a part of every country in the world today	21
14132	3740	It is was changes countries and makes them different, it gives them there own culture which we can share with each other	22
14133	3740	So no matter what we should should never try and take offensive or any kind of book off the shelves of libraries	23
14134	3740	Censorship @MONTH1 be needed but the offensive materials do not need to be taken off the face of the earth or thrown where no one could ever read it again	24
14135	3740	All in all we cannot get extinguish the flames of our past or we @MONTH1 never have a future	25
14136	3742	Libraries are a place where anyone can find books to read, on any topic they choose	0
14137	3742	This is a right that should stay in the reader's hands, and not the library's	1
14138	3742	Every person can read about whatever topics they please, and those working at libraries should not have an influence on which books peole read	2
14139	3742	Censorship of books is competely unneccessary	3
14140	3742	If somebody wants to read about a specific topic, then they have the right to	4
14141	3742	Reading a book that is offensive to the reader is the reader's choice	5
14142	3742	nobody forced them to read it	6
14143	3742	Upon finding a book that is offensive, the reader then can make that decision, and not read the book	7
14144	3742	Though just because this one reader finds this book offensive, does not mean a different person would, and this different person has the right to read this book if they choose	8
14145	3742	Finding a book offensive is a simply an opinion, and has no factual evidence	9
14146	3742	So who has the right to say whether a book is offensive or not	10
14147	3742	Just because somebody running a library belives a book to be offensive or innappropriate, does not mean the book should be taken off the shelf	11
14148	3742	There is no one person who can say whether or not a book is offensive	12
14149	3742	Other items such as music, movies, or magazines also should not be censored, though some of them are already	13
14150	3742	Movies for example, are all rated, and this therfore gives the viewer the choice of what level of movie they would like to watch	14
14151	3742	The viewer should not expect to check out a rated '@CAPS1' movie, and see no material with foul language, violence, or other 'offensive' subjects	15
14152	3742	By choosing a higher rated movie, the viewer is making their own choice of what they see, and so the librarians should not take it upon themselves to take away these films	16
14153	3742	It is simply not thier responsibility	17
14154	3742	Music also is rated, and if thought neccessary, has a parental warning label, telling the listener that this album has explicit content	18
14155	3742	Though just as with movies or books, everybody has the right to listen to whichever music they please, and should not have to search at places other than a library, because the librarian thought the music to be innappropriate	19
14156	3742	Magazines @MONTH1 not be rated, but this does not mean the library should make the executive decision to rate them, and get rid of the ones found to be 'offensive'	20
14157	3742	As mentioned several times above, it is the reader's choice to view material	21
14158	3742	not the librarian's	22
14159	3742	Whether the material is books, music, movies, or magazines, the consumer has the right to read, listen to, or view whatever they please, without the influence of librarians	23
14160	3742	Each person has their own say of what material they choose to consume, and nobody else has the right to tell them otherwise.	24
14161	3743	Dear Newspaper,     I don't think there should be censorship at all	0
14162	3743	Everyone has the right to read or watch whatever makes them happy	1
14163	3743	Just because someone is offended by them doesn't mean it shouldnt exist	2
14164	3743	Maybe if you were to take books and movies off the shelfs for censory that alone would offend someone	3
14165	3743	It would offend the person who wrote the book or made the movie	4
14166	3743	There are many reasons why censory shouldnt be in libraries	5
14167	3743	My first reason is freedom of speech	6
14168	3743	People have the right to say or write whatever they believe	7
14169	3743	Just because it can offend someone doesnt mean you should take the opportunity to read away from the people it doesn't offend	8
14170	3743	Give people the full right to read and write whatever it is they want to	9
14171	3743	Also if you use censorship then it's going to effect literature in a bad way	10
14172	3743	By using Censorship you will have to take the books that offend people off the shelves	11
14173	3743	Not having these books up on the shelves, means no one can read them	12
14174	3743	If no one can read the books, no one learns	13
14175	3743	One more thing to take into consideration, is the authors money	14
14176	3743	Alot of times in the library if I see a book I really like, I'll go buy it	15
14177	3743	But taking these books off the shelves means no one will see them	16
14178	3743	The author's write these books so they can make a point and make money	17
14179	3743	If we take the books down, they dont make money and they dont make their intended point	18
14180	3743	In conclution I think censory is overall a bad idea	19
14181	3743	One because of freedom of speech	20
14182	3743	Second is it could possibly drastically effect literature	21
14183	3743	Third is its taking away authors money and point of view	22
14184	3743	These are the important reasons I do not surrport censory.	23
14185	3744	I dont think that music, magazines, books, or movies should be removed from the shelf because if some people dont like it some other people might find it intertaining than what other people do	0
14186	3744	I think that if people dont want there children to see it then dont let them	1
14187	3744	I believe that children should have the right to know about some things but not all	2
14188	3744	I mean everyone has the right to know about what is going on or what happened years and years ago	3
14189	3744	I mean it is all put out there to be seen not hidden from eople because people want others to know what has happened even if they take  it the wrong way	4
14190	3744	I would rather my children know about everything so they know what is wrong and what is right	5
14191	3744	There is some stuff out there in books, magazines, and ect	6
14192	3744	that shoouldnt be seen or heard of but people listen and read it all the time no matter what it is	7
14193	3744	Schools teach children about almost anything does that mean schools should be shut down	8
14194	3744	No	9
14195	3744	Some people homeschool their kids for that reason ,but do they think about when they go out in public what people say or do	10
14196	3744	I dont think so, there is really no reason that if people take it offensive about something they read or listen to	11
14197	3744	There is no reason for people to take it off the shelf if they dont like it because other people will and they will buy it just to listen or to read something	12
14198	3744	People need to realize that there is stuff everywhere that people dont want their children hearing but they hear it anyway	13
14199	3744	It is just hoe our economy is these days.	14
14200	3746	In the current life we are all living we find a need to make things more an more private	0
14201	3746	If this something is said and we don't like it we find the urge to rid the @CAPS2 of to '@CAPS1' other people from it	1
14202	3746	In modern writing @DATE1 and all throughout history there have been certain books that we don't like because they go against what we find moraly right	2
14203	3746	But just because a group of people say it's wrong is there a need to completely abolish from the @LOCATION1	3
14204	3746	No	4
14205	3746	When something is written it is written for a purpose	5
14206	3746	If there was no purpose then we wouldn't have anything to read at all in the first place	6
14207	3746	Yes, there are some books and magazine's that can be very vivid and unsutable for younger minds to experience	7
14208	3746	But that it is why these books are created for older people to read	8
14209	3746	I am a large fan of books over the two @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that took place	9
14210	3746	I find them very fascinating and I love to see what my life could be like @DATE1 if the outcomes of those @CAPS3 would have been different	10
14211	3746	I will admit many of these books contain things that are very real in a sense that some adults even can't handle, but this would be no reason to get rid of them all together	11
14212	3746	These books signify a great part of human history that many people need to know	12
14213	3746	Without these books these @CAPS3 can become something in the past and nothing more	13
14214	3746	There are also many books out there that have a large deal to do with very mature themes	14
14215	3746	These bookos can include very detailed areas about a sex scene	15
14216	3746	Yes indeed these books can definently be very unsutable for younger kids	16
14217	3746	But that is where the idea that these books were not created for them	17
14218	3746	They were created for older more mature readers	18
14219	3746	Also if we are so concerned as to what our children are seeing then that is where the parent would have to step in	19
14220	3746	The parent can control the limit in the intensity or maturity of the books their child is reading	20
14221	3746	Looking out for what are children see is a large matter, the other side though is the thought of people getting ideas from reading more intense books	21
14222	3746	For instance when people find something that they truly believe in they can become very motivated to expand peoples knoledge of that matter	22
14223	3746	If one person reads a book about poloitics and see a side that they have never seen before they could become driven to form a group to drive that thought or matter into all of the minds of the human race	23
14224	3746	This could greatly affect us by having a large amount of people come to an uproar at a group even as large as our current governament	24
14225	3746	But even though this could happen what type of free, run by the people for the people, group are we now	25
14226	3746	Overall putting restrictions on the things we read or see, to our country, would have to be moraly wrong	26
14227	3746	Limiting what are nation can see would lead to most likely more of an uproar than just having to deal with different thoughts or outlooks of a group of people	27
14228	3746	This could happen because people would see it as the government maybe making more socialist acts by trying to control our knoledge.	28
14229	3747	I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the library shelves	0
14230	3747	If the materials propose things like racism, I would like those items taken off the shelves	1
14231	3747	Sometimes politics have a say in this	2
14232	3747	This is my say on this topic	3
14233	3747	First off, people have an option of looking at those things on the shelves or on the internet	4
14234	3747	All of us have our own opinion about what is offensive and what is not offensive	5
14235	3747	Lots of people have families and kids and they don't want their kids to have to see that kind of stuff	6
14236	3747	The parents have the knowlegde of where most of the materials in libraries are	7
14237	3747	Also if the parents want to get books, why not go to a different library and get books	8
14238	3747	Or go to a store that sells books and is a little more censored	9
14239	3747	I only have one execption though, if the materials in the book, music, movie, magazine is racist in anyway, I would want that removed from the shelf	10
14240	3747	Many people have the choice of wheather or not to go to a place that has offensive materials	11
14241	3747	Sometimes the local, state or even the federal government have a say in wheather or not this kind of material gets put on the shelves of libraries or on the internet	12
14242	3747	Who knows, maybe someone likes these kinds of books, music, magazines, movies etc., and they don't want them takin off the the shelves or off the internet	13
14243	3747	Even going on the computer and 'surfing the web' for stuff like that is a little bit crazy, but thats their choice	14
14244	3747	So thats my view on the censorship in libraries.	15
14245	3748	Should certain books and magazines be removed from the shelves if found offensive 	0
14246	3748	YES	1
14247	3748	Children shouldnt be exposed to certain things	2
14248	3748	Some books and magazines are to explict for children at certain ages	3
14249	3748	Children should read books that meet their age group	4
14250	3748	If children read books that are inapporiate for their age they might start to act out that way	5
14251	3748	Parents should try and remove all books that are offense to their children because that can have a real bad affect on them	6
14252	3748	Children at a certain age group should read books thats on their level and apporiate for them	7
14253	3748	Certain books, magazines, music, and movies are to explict for kids these days	8
14254	3748	I think they should all be blocked and out of children reach	9
14255	3748	If children started to listen inapporiate music and read offense books it might affect the way they act	10
14256	3748	Children shouldnt be exposed to things that might brain wash them	11
14257	3748	If kids start toread horrible book and listen to bad music imagine what affect it might have on them in the world we live in today	12
14258	3748	I think parents should try and do all they can to keep certain things out of the reach of their children	13
14259	3748	Parents should protest and call meetings to make sure libraries are taking inapporiate things off the shelves for kids	14
14260	3748	Parents should want to keep kids far away form certain things that @MONTH1 appear offense	15
14261	3748	It will mean that they'll doing their job as a good parent	16
14262	3748	Sometimes kids wont always agree with what the parent might say but they hav to realize it could be whats best for them	17
14263	3748	Parents shouldn't always want to be their child friend because, sometimes kids would run over you	18
14264	3748	I know from personal exprience because sometimes peoplecan take kindness for weakness	19
14265	3748	Being a parent you should already be prepared for things like this	20
14266	3748	In conclusion explict magazines, books, and music should really be taken off the shelves from kids	21
14267	3748	It might expose children somethings that isnt always good for them	22
14268	3749	If i had the right to remove books, music, magazines or other things that were offensive from a library i wouldn't do it	0
14269	3749	I wouldn't do it because everybody as a right to read, lisen and see whatever they want	1
14270	3749	If people really didn't want to see offensive books or anything else why would they be seeing it in the first place	2
14271	3749	Some parents think that they shouldn't have offensive books beacuse it would affect their children.Their would be a change in kids education	3
14272	3749	Everybody has the right to read whatever they want	4
14273	3749	Their are different kinds of people that like to read different kinds of things	5
14274	3749	If books would have to be remove from the library then everybody would start taking all the books out	6
14275	3749	One way or another evrybody ends up reading all those offensive books at a certain point of their lifes anyways	7
14276	3749	The parents that are so worried about what their kids would see at a library should inform themselves of what their kids are reading and prohibid them from doing it	8
14277	3749	In my opinion I think that if parents took the time to explains their kids the good and bad things about life it wouldn't be that offensive for their children	9
14278	3749	Another reason of why i wouldn't remove books from a library is because it would affect the education of many kids	10
14279	3749	Removing books means taking away history from them	11
14280	3749	There are many painters in our history that painted naked womans many people find that offensive	12
14281	3749	I think they should never take that history from them beacuse they are just learning things about their history	13
14282	3749	Books, music, magazines, ect should not be remove from libraries	14
14283	3749	Because those things are important for everybody whether you read or not	15
14284	3749	Removing this items would just be a total chaos	16
14285	3749	They should leave the libraries just the way they are	17
14286	3749	Everybody has the right to read, lisen and see whatever they want.	18
14287	3750	Should certain material found to be offensive be removed from the shelves of our library	0
14288	3750	Many people find material they see in libraries such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., to be offensive	1
14289	3750	but does that mean that they should be removed	2
14290	3750	I believe along with many others that libraries should not censor out offensive materials	3
14291	3750	To censor libraries would neglect parent responsibilities, destroy our profitable media, and be unconstitutional	4
14292	3750	Parents are responsible for their children, not only when it comes to providing food and shelter, but also when their children are viewing inappropriate or offensive material	5
14293	3750	If you do not want your child to be offended or see vulgar shows, texts, and music, do not let them see it	6
14294	3750	For instance, if a child is listening to a sexual song on their I-pod take it from them	7
14295	3750	It is not a right to have the device it is a privelage and parents are aloud to take away privelages	8
14296	3750	In addition to neglecting the parent's responsibilities, it would be a gigantic blow to the media economically	9
14297	3750	Most media is viewed, because of the inappropriate material appearing in their shows, books, and music	10
14298	3750	If you censor all of that material out less movie tickets will be bought, less books will be sold, and less music will be listened to	11
14299	3750	In a time of recession, like the one we are currently coming out of it is more beneficial to provide as much income as possible, instead of destroying current oppurtunities for profit	12
14300	3750	Both of these points are valid, but most importantly censoring libraries would be unconstitutional	13
14301	3750	In the preamble we are given rights to the freedom of speech and press	14
14302	3750	These offensive materials are included in this right	15
14303	3750	I understand admentments can be added to specify what type of speech and press is appropriate, but how will officers monitor that	16
14304	3750	Not to mention all the jail space that would be needed for people smuggling inappropriate material to buyers	17
14305	3750	In brief censoring libraries is a bad idea in the areas of parent responsibilities, media economics, and our constitutional rights	18
14306	3750	When negatively effecting all of these areas the consequences are much more influential then the benefits	19
14307	3750	Obviously censoring is not the answer to offensive material	20
14308	3751	Let your mind wander to a place of peace and tranquility	0
14309	3751	You are in a world of endless possiblities	1
14310	3751	To each side of you lies a vast collection of diverse adventures and anecdotes	2
14311	3751	You are in a library where each book holds the key to a door of knowledge and adventure	3
14312	3751	Looking for an adventure of your own, you drift down each section searching for the one suitable to your liking	4
14313	3751	Turning the corner, your eyes suddenly glance over to some books and magazines with provocative and inappropriate pictures on them that are blatantly out in the open for anyone to gaze upon	5
14314	3751	Quickly turning your eyes from the unfortunate meeting of offensive pictures, you race down the hallway to a different section	6
14315	3751	You think to yourself how unecessary those images were, now scarred into your mind	7
14316	3751	In most libraries, you will find anything you are looking for that can be contained within the confines of a book	8
14317	3751	I believe that because libraries are used by everyone of all different ages, races, and genders, that some censorship should be put into effect	9
14318	3751	Some of the content found in libraries should be censored due to a diverse group of people in the world with different views, opinions, and morals	10
14319	3751	This censorship is @CAPS1 narrowed down to just inappropriate images, but religious, political, and cultural innuendo as well	11
14320	3751	Censorship should be evident in all sections of the library	12
14321	3751	I do @CAPS1 think that certain books should necessarily be removed from the shelf because of violation of rights to speech which includes written speech as well	13
14322	3751	I do, however, think that they should be sectioned off and clearly marked to warn unwanting eyes and ears of the material found there	14
14323	3751	Libraries are one of the number one resources when researching, reading, or gaining information and knowledge	15
14324	3751	Most everyone has used, uses, or will use a library in their life	16
14325	3751	This includes children and families	17
14326	3751	Children do @CAPS1 need to be experiencing, learning about, or exposed to some of the content and material found in libraries	18
14327	3751	I do @CAPS1 think the books should be removed from the shelves, but put somewhere else where a child could @CAPS1 find it	19
14328	3751	Children have rapidly developing minds and are sometimes defined by the images that they are exposed to	20
14329	3751	Something a child sees is more commonly and easily remembered for a longer time than if an adult would see that	21
14330	3751	This shows that it is @CAPS1 good for a child to see such offensive things	22
14331	3751	Censorship, in regard to moving the books to a new location where a child can @CAPS1 stumble upon it, is the best choice	23
14332	3751	Another reason that I believe that the books should @CAPS1 be removed completely, but rather taken somewhere else in the library, is because that everyone has the right to express their opinions and feelings toward a subject	24
14333	3751	Also, others have the right to express their opinions toward another's thoughts	25
14334	3751	Just because you find something offensive doesn't give you the right to take that away from someone	26
14335	3751	I think that if a person so desires such things and feels the need to read about them, then they have the right and the choice to do that	27
14336	3751	Although, people who do @CAPS1 want to see that should also have the choice to have that somewhere where they will @CAPS1 come across it	28
14337	3751	This is why the books should @CAPS1 be out in the open for all to see, but taken to a secluded section	29
14338	3751	In conclusion, the best solution when dealing with offensive material found in libraries is to @CAPS1 remove it completely, but section it off from everything else and allow exclusive access to only those who so desire such material	30
14339	3751	Everyone should have a choice and a right to see or @CAPS1 to see certain material they might find offensive	31
14340	3751	In doing so, the library, I believe, will become a better environment to all those who wish to access and use it	32
14341	3751	More people will use it and the library will then appeal to everyone.	33
14342	3752	No, I do not believe that anything should be taken out of a library because someone thinks it's offensive	0
14343	3752	I believe that poeple have the right to read what they want and so do authers have the right to wright what they want	1
14344	3752	One of the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 statements is @CAPS5 of speech giving people the right to say and wright what they want	2
14345	3752	People shouldn't take anything out of libraries because libraries are built for storing things like books, magazines, music, and movies	3
14346	3752	If people start to take those things away then what use would be for a library	4
14347	3752	If everything is taken out then nobody would have any reason for going to a library	5
14348	3752	This brings up the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2	6
14349	3752	''@CAPS5 of speech'' meens that people have the right to wright what they want to	7
14350	3752	if others find it offensive, then don't reed it	8
14351	3752	Also @CAPS5 of expresion lets people do this to	9
14352	3752	If people wish to express themselves by reeding it then they have that right	10
14353	3752	One of my personal experiences is that I love music, so do my two best friends	11
14354	3752	One of them goes to the library to find music and we both listen to it	12
14355	3752	He found these bands I had never heard and I realy liked them	13
14356	3752	If someone found them ''offensive'' I would have never got to hear how good they were	14
14357	3752	This is why I believe that people shouldn't take things out of the libraries	15
14358	3752	not only does it deny others of something they could love but it also destroys history	16
14359	3752	libraries will be around for a long time and they store so much information,it would be a shame to deny future people the right to read these wonderfull peices of work someone worked real hard on to create.	17
14360	3753	In libraries there are a bunch of books, music, movies, magazines, and etc	0
14361	3753	to let the general public check out	1
14362	3753	This topic about censorship in libraries is a diffitcult one because everyone has different views on things in life	2
14363	3753	Certain materials in libraries should not be remove from the shevles if they are found offensive by someone	3
14364	3753	Being in a library there are lots of choices to see and check out	4
14365	3753	In a library, someone comes arcoss a book or a movie that seems offensive to them	5
14366	3753	That someone should just look at the other way because a library is for the general public	6
14367	3753	It seems to be harse about this, but it is not up to that person if the material in the library should or should not be in that library	7
14368	3753	The materials that are offensive to people could be in a special place in the library to comitdate everyone	8
14369	3753	Libraries have the right to censor any type of material that seems or is offensive to the community	9
14370	3753	This is right if the community strongly agrees with their local libraries	10
14371	3753	If the whole community disagree with a library about a certain material then the community have a say in it	11
14372	3753	Yes, there are books out in libraries that are offensive to a group of people, but that does not mean take that material out of the library	12
14373	3753	Our country, @LOCATION1, say that everyone has the right to free speech	13
14374	3753	@LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 has banned books thats are offensive to @CAPS1, but other countries around the @LOCATION2 might have those books in their libraries	14
14375	3753	There is a thick line if a certain type of material in a library is offensive or not	15
14376	3753	Someone should not have the right if a  book seems offensive to that person, but if the whole community says that the book is offensive then yes	16
14377	3753	The libraries and the community have choices to not have a offensive book on the self	17
14378	3753	If it is offensive to everyone then it should be off the shelf	18
14379	3753	Censorship is a diffitcult topic to agured on	19
14380	3754	No, I dont think you should be able to take the magazines off the shelf because it is pointless,to some people @MONTH1 find everything offensive and others @MONTH1 not find it offensive like me personally stuff people find offinsive I find it kind of humorous	0
14381	3754	And I understand how some people are more likely to be offended because of say their sexuality or ethnicity	1
14382	3754	But other than that there should be no censorship it makes the place that is doing it seem like they are very strict and because of those strict policys it makes some people wanna go there less to get what they want and who knows the thing you @MONTH1 want @MONTH1 be censored	2
14383	3754	And I understand that when you have a kid you dont want them to fo the wrong things in life and try and keep them away from the bad stuff as long as possible	3
14384	3754	But as your child grows older he will be introduced to older/adult type material and you should cut them a break and not punish them very bad when something like that happens	4
14385	3754	From my humble opinion some parents are very strict about censorship and I completely understand the parents point of view	5
14386	3754	Eventually people will have to let their children find out about certain things, so you might as well allow them to see it at possibly the age of @NUM1 or so that seems like a suitable age for early privelages	6
14387	3754	When it comes to taking items off a shelf some peole have worse judgement than other people and that can effect everyone from their bad judgement.	7
14388	3755	Imagine	0
14389	3755	A nice sunny day, sitting outside under a tree and reading one of your favorite books	1
14390	3755	Feeling the wind in your hair and taking in all that is going on in the story	2
14391	3755	You not only read at home but at school as well	3
14392	3755	Just think, what if you could not read that book because it was offensive to someone else in your school	4
14393	3755	How unfair it would to allow nobody to read that book just because of one person	5
14394	3755	This i could not imagine	6
14395	3755	At my school, teachers and other faculty are always encouarging kids my age to read more often	7
14396	3755	Most teenagers are always busy participating in after school events such as: band, playing a sport, theater, choir, ect	8
14397	3755	Not many teens are able to just be alone and read a good book, which is why I was so shocked when i heard about this strange news	9
14398	3755	Should books, magazines, ect., be removed from shelves if they are offensive	10
14399	3755	I do not think doing that would be a good decsion	11
14400	3755	Kids should be able to read what they want to read	12
14401	3755	As you probably know, not all kids are alike	13
14402	3755	Some enjoy things that others @MONTH1 not	14
14403	3755	For example, not all kids like to eat corn	15
14404	3755	This goes with reading as well	16
14405	3755	Not all kids like to read romantic or action books	17
14406	3755	I enjoy reading romantic and mystery novel	18
14407	3755	Some novels, more than others have a lot more graphic content such as @CAPS1	19
14408	3755	@CAPS1 has a lot of fighing in it	20
14409	3755	If a mother did not want her son to be exposed to fighting, should we take all @CAPS1 movies, books, and magazines out of our libraries	21
14410	3755	Another example would be the @CAPS3 series	22
14411	3755	Some parents do not want their children reading about vampires and werewolves	23
14412	3755	Should we not be able to borrow or rent this movies	24
14413	3755	I do not think so	25
14414	3755	Another reason I do not think that we should take out book and magazines in our libraries is, not everyone is offended by the same thing	26
14415	3755	For example, @ORGANIZATION2	27
14416	3755	Personally in my family, me and my brother believed in @LOCATION1 for many years	28
14417	3755	My cousins however, do not teach their children about @ORGANIZATION2	29
14418	3755	If I brought over @ORGANIZATION1 and read it to their kids and they got offended, should we get rid of @ORGANIZATION1	30
14419	3755	The answer is no	31
14420	3755	Some families have a tradition	32
14421	3755	Just because one family does not want their kids to know about @ORGANIZATION2 does not mean that eveyone should not be able to get the satisfaction of reading or seeing a movie about @ORGANIZATION2	33
14422	3755	So the final question is, should certain materials be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	34
14423	3755	Can one person eliminate more than one book just because it offensive to them	35
14424	3755	I guess it all depends on your view of the situation	36
14425	3755	I do not think that offensive novels should be taken of the shelves because: kids should have a choice in what they want to read, not everyone is going to think that the same book if offensive and lastly because if we got rid of all the offensive books	37
14426	3755	what books would be left to read	38
14427	3756	There are many books, types of music, movies, magazines, etc	0
14428	3756	that are found offensive to people	1
14429	3756	Should they be removed	2
14430	3756	It depends	3
14431	3756	If something is so inappropriate or offensive then it should be removed	4
14432	3756	Today, there are many books that teach or give a bad message	5
14433	3756	If I see one, I just try ignore it	6
14434	3756	I do not pick it up and read the back or take it home and read it	7
14435	3756	I know what I am allowed and not allowed to read	8
14436	3756	But does that mean I should take it off the shelf and throw it away because I'm not allowed to read it	9
14437	3756	No	10
14438	3756	As much as I would like to, just to prevent others from reading it, I cannot	11
14439	3756	It is sad that we have to worry about these things in the first place	12
14440	3756	I think the area where the most offensive things are, are movies	13
14441	3756	There are so many movies now that have inappropriate scenes: bad language, scary scenes, etc	14
14442	3756	Some movies are not rated appropriately either	15
14443	3756	There is a movie out now that is rated @NUM1 and is extremely scary	16
14444	3756	I cannot imgaine watching this movie as a middle schooler	17
14445	3756	I watched it as a sophomore and was scared	18
14446	3756	I never would have though it would have been that bad because of its rating	19
14447	3756	Some movies for children even have inappropriate things	20
14448	3756	they might be hidden and the child not understand, but it is still there	21
14449	3756	Why does it need to be there in the first place	22
14450	3756	Is it that important	23
14451	3756	No	24
14452	3756	Another area that is bad, are video games	25
14453	3756	There are kids who play them so much, all they think about is killing, guns, and war	26
14454	3756	There are kids who think of these things so much they begin to think it is cool to point guns and knives at other kids	27
14455	3756	Some do it in a joking way, but others do not	28
14456	3756	These things are dangerous and hurt people-mentally and even emotionally	29
14457	3756	You go to a grocery store or a gas station and see magazines with inappropriate things on them	30
14458	3756	No child should see those things, but if they are there anyone is going to look	31
14459	3756	Different genres of music @MONTH1 even send bad messages	32
14460	3756	There are some radio stations that, with certain songs, bleep out words like drugs and alcohol, but with other songs that have curse words, keep them there	33
14461	3756	I do not really understand that	34
14462	3756	Yes, drugs and alcohol are bad, but why isn't a curse word	35
14463	3756	Just saying the words drug or alcohol are not bad	36
14464	3756	These types of things are very offensive to people	37
14465	3756	But is there really anything they can do	38
14466	3756	Not really	39
14467	3756	We all have our opinions and we can speak our minds, but sometimes we do not get want we always want	40
14468	3756	We cannot really do anything about this	41
14469	3756	Others belive it is okay to watch and listen and read these kinds of things, but with the things we read, watch, adn list to on a regular basis are what we think about	42
14470	3756	If you put bad things in your mind that is all you will begin to think about and it will become a part of your life	43
14471	3757	I belive that beople have the right to know and learn about stuff even if it is found offensive, the reasone why i say this is because if one person finds it offensive doesn't mean that another person might think it is	0
14472	3757	If people think that a film from back in the late @NUM1's about the @ORGANIZATION1 that is used for educational perposes is racist, then they need to just grow up and to go back to school for this stuff	1
14473	3757	Just because some people think that a book with vulger language is offencive then they need to know that more than half of the worlds book have profanitey in them and just because it does, doesn't mean that they need to be removed form the shelfs in the library	2
14474	3757	I have had my own incounters with books that i thought were offencive, there was a book that i was reading in my fresh year of high school and there were people in it that were part of the @PERSON2 and they were having meetings and one guy said that he hated negros and they he had picked one for tonigh and were going to lynch them with the nuse they had made the night before and that really hurt me because I have some one in my famliy that is black and to think about someone doing that to him, that would just break my heart and I would probaly go out and find the people that did it and kill them	3
14475	3757	In the quote that was writen by Katherine Paterson, she talked about how if she has the right to remove a book then we do to and if we do so then there will be no more books left for us on the shelf is a great way to say that almost everybook we have has something volger in them and if we were to take them all away then there would be none left	4
14476	3757	If there was the posibility of all the books being taken away from us then there would be a huge uprising and everything would be going down hill form there, because there are people that can't go a day with out reading a part of there book and some people have devoted three hours to reading ounce a day	5
14477	3757	What im trying to say is that there is no way to get rid of our books today that have volger langage or something offencive in them because if we tryed to do that then we would be taking every book away in the world and then no one would be learning anything	6
14478	3758	The question is, should we censor materials in libraries if it is offensive	0
14479	3758	In my opinion I dont think they should censor the material	1
14480	3758	Some things that we read, see, and hear are just going to be offensive, and we cant control everything that offends us	2
14481	3758	I do agree that people have freedom of speech, but not over everything	3
14482	3758	People need to stop over reacting to something that might have been said @DATE1	4
14483	3758	Some things just need to be left in the past and kept there	5
14484	3758	For example, some @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are still upset over slavery, and that happened over a @NUM1 @DATE1 @DATE1	6
14485	3758	Censoring certain things means that people are not going to learn from the mistakes of our pass	7
14486	3758	We need to stop all this over protection in our libraries of all places	8
14487	3758	Children need to know what has happened in our past to see what they can change in our future	9
14488	3758	Why	10
14489	3758	Why is my only question to why the people want to censor material in the libraries	11
14490	3758	Are they trying to keep their children from seeing it or just for their own selfish reasons	12
14491	3758	My conclusion is that they should not censor material because it offends someone	13
14492	3758	I have been offended by lots of things that I have read but I dont try to get them censored or removed from the place I read it	14
14493	3758	Sometimes you just have to deal with things that you dont like or dont agree with sometimes.	15
14494	3760	There are so many resaons why taking a book, movie, or anything else off the shelves is wrong	0
14495	3760	If it is violent or sexual i can see why it shouldn't be on the shelves but if the reader doesn't like the book or movie, then don't read it or watch it find something else	1
14496	3760	If everyone took a book of the shelf that they didn't like then what would we have to read because everyone has a book or two that they don't like or think is offensive	2
14497	3760	Every book can't be perfect for that person	3
14498	3760	Everyone has there own veiws on books wether they like it or dislike it	4
14499	3760	If that book isn't what your looking for then put it back and stop reading it	5
14500	3760	There have been many of people say 'If you don't like it then don't listen to it'	6
14501	3760	They are excaclly right because if there is something that you can't stand to listen to or read and you do it anyway thats going to make you mad	7
14502	3760	Then your going to complain that it is on the shelfs and say it is bad and it shouldn't be on the shelves anymore	8
14503	3760	That is what starts all these things of people saying it is offensive	9
14504	3760	People know what they like and don't like, so if there is something that you don't like then don't listen to it or read it	10
14505	3760	It all comes down to common sence	11
14506	3760	We all have it we just need to start using it	12
14507	3760	That means if you like country music then don't listen to hard rock or rap because that isn't what you like so don't listen to it	13
14508	3760	Because if you listen to it then your like why is that stuff on the shevles for people to listen to it's bad for you it is puting bad thought into those teenager's heads	14
14509	3760	If eveyone sticks to doing what they like and don't worry about the other stuff then eveyone will be fine.	15
14510	3761	History is bond to repeat itself right	0
14511	3761	Well, we must make sure that this is a great opportunity to ensure our future @LOCATION2	1
14512	3761	By censuring items on certain shelves is like when your mother makes you leave the kitchen so you don't get burned	2
14513	3761	This is just a way to protect the minds of young ones, which are like little sponges soaking everything they see or hear up	3
14514	3761	The effects of what @MONTH1 come are far worst than making it so an adult must reach a little high for the book they want to read	4
14515	3761	Making it so only certain material is available to young children and teenagers is a way to prevent the same racism, poverty, assinations, and religions protests of the past	5
14516	3761	The @ORGANIZATION1 prides itself on that children are the future, well, why not put in the effort to prevent the from seeing what the see or read	6
14517	3761	I wish that when I was younger many people were trying to stop causes of such things as teen pregancy, drugs, alcohol, and abuse	7
14518	3761	But, there wasn't, there was a thirteen year old girl in my class who got pregant	8
14519	3761	She thought it was cool, because she read it in a book	9
14520	3761	This book she read wasn't hers it was her mothers and she left it on the table to take back to the library	10
14521	3761	Her mother forgot and @PERSON2 read that book	11
14522	3761	She told a bunch of friends and me about it	12
14523	3761	@PERSON2 said the book explained what guys wanted	13
14524	3761	She did that because of a made up story her mother checked out at a library	14
14525	3761	This story makes me think about why they should put books on a different shelf or higher up	15
14526	3761	I have two younger sisters who already have to worry about being picked on	16
14527	3761	because of their clothes, their religion, the fact that they only listen to certain music	17
14528	3761	They should be able to go to school, and not worry about the book that they @MONTH1 grab at the library	18
14529	3761	My sisters are the inspiration for me to make the world in which we live a better place,well, my brother is too	19
14530	3761	But, my point is they should have to live up to the expectations of others, or the what's cool	20
14531	3761	By censuring what children are reading or listening to is a way to make them be children	21
14532	3761	When they look at magazines or listen to music, they make discissions that could effect the rest of their lives	22
14533	3761	Just like how @ORGANIZATION2 has a new song out	23
14534	3761	The lyrics are inapporiate of many young children, but you can look it up on youtube	24
14535	3761	The lyrics of many songs or singles that have just been released are astounding	25
14536	3761	These songs show us why children are having children, or doing drugs	26
14537	3761	It is all caused by what they see or hear around them	27
14538	3761	Our country has hit an economical low, and this is caused by the youth not taking life seriously	28
14539	3761	I think that if we could focus on the factors in hand, such as censuring we @MONTH1 accomplish something no one else has	29
14540	3761	To show the world @LOCATION2's youth is the future, and it is looking pretty bright	30
14541	3761	We each should take proud it making the children learn better, act better, and above all make their dreams come true	31
14542	3761	If we have more students reading stuff such as, ' @LOCATION1, or To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2,' and enjoy them it would show that their dreams can come true fiction or non-fiction	32
14543	3761	It doesn't aways matter as long as your reading something that isn't stopping your mind to grow and develop fully	33
14544	3761	Many of the young women in my sophmore class have read, ' the @CAPS3 series,' and they loved it which made them read other vamiper books	34
14545	3761	It shows we can read stuff that is stimulating and not just to make us act like celebrates who party all the time or go to jail	35
14546	3761	By looking at those magazines or reading books about those people teenagers think that everyone is doing it	36
14547	3761	To tell you the truth more people aren't doing it and have found other ways to stay occupied	37
14548	3761	We have say in whether or not the future is good or bad why not make the choice easier by elimating the ones we would choose for ourselves at the age of children picking up the books or reading the magazines	38
14549	3761	about @PERSON1 who just drove around with her baby on her lap	39
14550	3761	What choice are you choosing for you life	40
14551	3761	In my personal oppion I believe children and adults should have separate televisions shows, magazines, and books	41
14552	3761	We want children to mature without the lies that everyone lives this way	42
14553	3761	These are the reasons as well as more to why censuring in libraries would help the impact of lies to children lessen	43
14554	3761	To add one final thing, would you tell everything you know to a five year old if you knew they would retain every word	44
14555	3761	I don't think I would want them to mature that fast, otherwise what is the point of life, or school	45
14556	3761	To go and learn what you already know	46
14557	3763	Books and movies are a way for many people to use their imagination and creativity	0
14558	3763	Taking certain books off the shelves @MONTH1 have a negative effect on people	1
14559	3763	Certain books, music, movies, and magazines are not always as bad as what some people think	2
14560	3763	People have different views on what is good and bad, so you cannot really remove certain books because, like Katherine Paterson said, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We need to leave every book on the shelves	3
14561	3763	Using my own observations, reading, and my own experience I will prove to you that we need those books on our shelves	4
14562	3763	First, I watch younger children getting so many books off the shelves and maybe they aren't the best for them	5
14563	3763	I believe from watching them, that it helps them grow	6
14564	3763	Being a young kid you're curious and they need to be able to look at just about anything	7
14565	3763	Honestly, if it's really that bad to you they won't remember it the next day	8
14566	3763	Personally I think that them seeing what we call 'bad things' will make them not want to look again, and help them learn right from wrong	9
14567	3763	Secondly, I have seen many magazines, read many books, and watched many movies that I probably shouldn't have	10
14568	3763	I feel from seeing and reading those things it has made me a better person not to do the 'bad things' that they are doing	11
14569	3763	I've read books about slavery, and war and it just wants me to make the world a better place	12
14570	3763	Knowing that younger children than I are reading and seeing all this negativity in this world doesn't always put me in the spot to say 'keep everything on the shelves,' but I also believe children will know between right and wrong	13
14571	3763	Lastly, I have experienced children and young adults abusing the library and getting movies they shouldn't be watching, which would make many people want to take certain books off the shelves	14
14572	3763	Certain books need to be kept away from young kids, but not from everyone.We older, and more wiser adults need to realize that it's not all bad, yes bad for our young ones but maybe not for someone else	15
14573	3763	A family member of mine is a photographer and he looks at nude magazines and movies to help him with his career	16
14574	3763	Not every nude movie and magazine is abused, and everyone should realize this	17
14575	3763	All in all, I understand of removing some books, magazines, and movies but we can't	18
14576	3763	I don't believe a certain book is offensive to everyone, just certain people	19
14577	3763	Different people need books and movies for different things, and they aren't all used for bad	20
14578	3763	We need to all come together as one to keep certain books out of young peoples' reach, so that the books and movies aren't abused	21
14579	3763	Hopefully, everyone keeps every book on the shelves	22
14580	3763	Again, as Katherine Paterson stated, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' if we remove them	23
14581	3765	Censorship in Libraries     The library presents to the community many different things for entertainment	0
14582	3765	They's a large variety of enterianment such as: romance movies, adventurous novels, dramatic music, comical magazines, and many others	1
14583	3765	Yet they're are some that have unappropriate things	2
14584	3765	I believe that any of the things in the libraries that have unappropriate things in them should be censored or removed from the public view	3
14585	3765	If this is done it will benefit our children's moral beliefs, the library's family image, and save money for better things	4
14586	3765	Our children are the most important things to us	5
14587	3765	They are the future of our country and our world	6
14588	3765	They are the people who will be leading our country	7
14589	3765	We teach our children from a young age our moral beliefs	8
14590	3765	Yet, if they start seeing or reading unappropitate things that they can find at a library then their moral views will change	9
14591	3765	They will think that the things they see are okay in society because it's in a library	10
14592	3765	If the library, which is thought to be one of the most educational places, has bad things then the image of the library will be thought as bad and dirty also	11
14593	3765	The library needs to censor the bad things to allow their self image to look well	12
14594	3765	Many parents won't want to take their children to the library if they know that there can be a magazine of death and murder laying out on the shelves	13
14595	3765	The library would also save alot of money if they censored the things they have	14
14596	3765	Many of the pornagraphical things they have cost alot of money	15
14597	3765	Usually if they buy movies that aren't censored it cost extra	16
14598	3765	If they buy things that are approptiate they would benefit greatly	17
14599	3765	They could us that money and buy better books and at a lower price	18
14600	3765	The library is a very important part to one's community	19
14601	3765	We need them in our lives and our children's lives also, but we won't take our children if we know that the things there aren't good for them	20
14602	3765	That's why the library need to censor the unapproptiate things so that the parents feel safe when going to the library	21
14603	3765	The library is a fun place to go, and it would be even better if everything there was good and not bad	22
14604	3766	Certain books, magazines or even music contains mature or graphic nature	0
14605	3766	The music will always have ratings, just like movies	1
14606	3766	They dont need to be deleted from a library unless it is an elementary school	2
14607	3766	Most language arts are sorted through out the library in an orderly fashion, so the younger children will only purchase there age level books, or art of choice	3
14608	3766	Music always contains warnings for the rating of the book	4
14609	3766	a child should never murchase a mature level book	5
14610	3766	books, movies, and music are all the same	6
14611	3766	they are made for certain types of audiance	7
14612	3766	If a movie is rated @CAPS1, then it is made for eighteen or older audiance	8
14613	3766	They are situated throughout the library for children, adults, and teens	9
14614	3766	The children just need to stay in there own age levels	10
14615	3766	If there is a mature or graphic book in a childrens library then that should cause conflict	11
14616	3766	any parent would agree with that statement	12
14617	3766	The only way these mature arts can be shared without conflict is through public libraries	13
14618	3766	public libraries that are divided to connect with all age groups	14
14619	3767	Keep or Remove	0
14620	3767	Every year, more and more books of significance to literature are being taken off of the shelves in our local libraries and classrooms	1
14621	3767	And although these books @MONTH1 contain some writing that is offensive now, they still have shaped the @CAPS1 culture today	2
14622	3767	Along with books, many movies and magazines are also being taken off of the shelves because of offensive material	3
14623	3767	Just because some of these materials @MONTH1 contain offensive content, does not give people the right to make them out of reach and deprive the public of what they enjoy	4
14624	3767	So is it right to remove offensive material from libraries	5
14625	3767	Absolutely not	6
14626	3767	Many people enjoy books, magazines, and movies of this nature	7
14627	3767	In reality, it is more than likely hurting the library's business more than anything because these types of materials is what @CAPS1 culture is all about	8
14628	3767	People don't want to read about what's happening at the animal shelter across the street	9
14629	3767	They want to read about what's going on in @LOCATION1 and about the hottest trends for seasons	10
14630	3767	All in all, removing these materials will only hurt the library's popularity and the amount of customers they attract	11
14631	3767	Artists write about what they love and how they feel	12
14632	3767	How can someone tell an author of a book that his or her writing is too graphic or too offensive	13
14633	3767	That is what he or she chose to write about	14
14634	3767	That is how he or she expresses themselves through their writing	15
14635	3767	By 'frowning upon' books, magazines or songs with certain offensive content, officials diminish the creativity and uniqueness of authors	16
14636	3767	If a certain author or artist has a really great, original idea for a new song or book, but is worried about it not being carried by libraries because it is a little offensive, then obviously that author or artist is not going to write that book or song	17
14637	3767	By removing offensive books, songs and movies, we the public are being robbed of creative and imaginitive writing	18
14638	3767	All in all, the removal of offensive books, magazines, movies, and songs is harmful to the public and to the libraries themselves	19
14639	3767	Generations @MONTH1 never even hear of 'The @CAPS2 of @PERSON1' just because it uses racial terms	20
14640	3767	So what would you do if put in this situation	21
14641	3767	Keep or remove?	22
14642	3768	In this persuation essay it will talk about the content of should we or shouldn't we remove all offensive books, music, movies, magazines of the shelf	0
14643	3768	In this essay everyone will agree with the content or be in the opposing side of the aurgument	1
14644	3768	In this essay it isn't the exception that this essay will disagree with some of the viewing audience	2
14645	3768	however, there are situations in which the audience can go with both sides	3
14646	3768	To begin with, in the matter of the case should we or should we not remove offensive books,music, magazines, or movies from the library	4
14647	3768	I don't believe that all content should be remove for all to see	5
14648	3768	In some cases there are the exception, but in banding all material doesn't seem logic	6
14649	3768	In my point of view the removal of materials seems a little extreme	7
14650	3768	however putting the content in a higher shelf seems more pratical instead of removal all for good	8
14651	3768	Yes, it might be offensive but in this time period offensive movies, books, magazines, books, and so on are look as more comedial and not taken serious	9
14652	3768	For example, a really offensive show called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' is a really offensive and people just see it as entertaining	10
14653	3768	This show can be offensive to everyone, but yet we still see it	11
14654	3768	In this show there is warning label stating only be seen to children @NUM1 and older	12
14655	3768	Parents are advice and to be acknowledge what their kids are seeing	13
14656	3768	It's not the creator of the content to be banned, yet it is the job as a parent to be mindful in what their kids are reading, watching, looking, or listening not them	14
14657	3768	In which case there there isn't away to be right in this subject	15
14658	3768	However the creators of the conent see it as a way to vent over their lifes, experiences, and what opticals they had to faceor just to make people laugh	16
14659	3768	They see it as a safe way to espress themselves	17
14660	3768	It might be offensive to you, but for some people that's there life	18
14661	3768	You might not like it or it @MONTH1 seem harsh for you, but that's real life	19
14662	3768	Secondly there are always something that @MONTH1 offend you, but it doesn't seem logical to banned it	20
14663	3768	An example might be religion	21
14664	3768	A religion a person might be it might offend you	22
14665	3768	It doesn't mean if the religion offensive that it will get banned or be remove for everyone	23
14666	3768	Your religion @MONTH1 offend someone, but they deal with it and embrace the differnces	24
14667	3768	If your friends has a different religion it doesn't mean you will never talk to them ever again	25
14668	3768	Thirdly, you might express yourself and there are going to be people out there that won't agree with you	26
14669	3768	You might create a book, a song, or a movie that will offend someone in a way	27
14670	3768	For example, the @CAPS3 series is offensive to some guys and girls	28
14671	3768	A disagrrement between two girls fighting over which charater is better for @CAPS4	29
14672	3768	There are always an opposing side	30
14673	3768	A @CAPS2 might be tried of hearing about @CAPS5 all of time and might find offensive when a girl @MONTH1 compare him to @CAPS6 or @PERSON1	31
14674	3768	Saying why can't boys be like them, but even then they don't remove @CAPS3 all together	32
14675	3768	For you it might seem the greatest movie ever, or the most terrible movie in the universe	33
14676	3768	Fourthly, another example is a @CAPS8 show called, '@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12' (queen of the south) where a women that had nothing to begin with, yet ended up being the most wanted in some countries	34
14677	3768	Some people @MONTH1 seem that it might be cool to be just like her	35
14678	3768	It doesn't seem that people will go uot there and do what she does cause in the television show shows all of the consequences there are if you do what she did	36
14679	3768	This show is an example of what could happen if you become exactly like her	37
14680	3768	Some offensive material @MONTH1 teach a lesson and can pervent a person to do something that they @MONTH1 later regreat	38
14681	3768	In conclusion, everything in our life offends us in some way	39
14682	3768	It doesn't matter what it is we deal with it and our life goes on	40
14683	3768	There is no way to see this, but one thing you enjoy maybe be offensive to others	41
14684	3768	It wouldn't seem fair to take something you enjoy just because it offended one person	42
14685	3768	So I belive that the libaries censorship isn't at risk	43
14686	3768	In my opinion everyone has the freedom to choose what they want to read, watch, or even listen to	44
14687	3768	And also have the choice to stop reading it, watching it, or listening to it	45
14688	3769	My views are that if it is offensive to someone or other people the certain maeterial shouldn't be taken off the shelf	0
14689	3769	I think you should have to have permission from a parent, or guardian if the material is explicit	1
14690	3769	For example in a store where you buy cd's, games ect..	2
14691	3769	you have to be of age to buy the material that should be the same with books	3
14692	3769	Say a book has a certain word on it like '@CAPS1' it shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because of its name	4
14693	3769	That brings up the subject don't judge a book by its cover	5
14694	3769	Just because the name isn't to someones standards it shouldn't matter	6
14695	3769	Pick the book up read the back and see what it's actualy about	7
14696	3769	Then if it's what you was exspecting it to be talk to someone who is in charge, and explain top them what the problem is in your case	8
14697	3769	Also you could always have a section of the store, or librarie just for adults only	9
14698	3769	It @MONTH1 sound stupid, but it can actualy help out alot	10
14699	3769	There is tons of books out there that have things in them not appropriate for children	11
14700	3769	Such as love books, they talk about love, and passion in ways that are very innappropriate for children	12
14701	3769	If there was a section of a store or librarie it could help keep these things out of your children, or other childrens minds	13
14702	3769	You or anyone else wouldnt have to worry about children picking certain material up that you wouldn't want them to see	14
14703	3769	Just keep this in mind next time your in a librarie and you see something you wouldn't like for your children to see	15
14704	3770	Censorship is a very sensitive topic	0
14705	3770	Everyone has to deal with censroship whether it is directly or indirectly	1
14706	3770	There have been many complaints and arguments involving the government regarding acts of censorship throughout the past	2
14707	3770	If censorship were to be equal for everyone, there would be nothing left in the world to be censored	3
14708	3770	Censorship is a major subject when dealing with books, newspaper articles, movies, and other literary subjects	4
14709	3770	The writer or director must be able to create an interesting topic or story line while at the same time keeping it appropriate for most audiences	5
14710	3770	If everyone were to censor one piece of literature or film that offended them in a certain way, then everything in life would be censored in one way or another	6
14711	3770	No matter what, there will always be a certain situation in which one person in the world will be offended by	7
14712	3770	Censorship is wrong, especially in the @LOCATION1	8
14713	3770	the @LOCATION1 citizens are granted the freedom of speech and the freedom of press	9
14714	3770	With an understanding of these basic freedoms, one would think that censorship is against the law considering it is one of the five basic freedoms granted to @LOCATION1 citizens	10
14715	3770	Censorship is wrong because it violates at least two of the five basic freedoms granted to all @LOCATION1 citizens	11
14716	3770	There should be absolutely no censorship when dealing with books, movies, and newspaper articles, because they all deal with the freedom of speech, or the freedom of press	12
14717	3770	If the act of censorship begins to expand, everything we know today will become censored in some manner just because one person would find it offensive	13
14718	3770	Some citizens @MONTH1 argue that censorship is a positive thing because it filters out all of the inappropriate, offensive, and derrogatory language and situations from our nation's youth, but from a teenager's standpoint, the children will find out about such situations and language use regardless	14
14719	3770	There is no point in hiding the truth from anyone, because no matter what they will find out eventually	15
14720	3770	We need to push for less censorship in the @LOCATION1, because if we want to keep our five basic freedoms of life granted to us by the first amendmant, then we need to fight back censorship and remove it completely from our society	16
14721	3771	Libaries everywhere might have a book or two that @MONTH1 be offensive to a reader	0
14722	3771	I haven't found a book offensive to my readings just yet	1
14723	3771	Some people might think that some music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of the library	2
14724	3771	But some people are against it, like me	3
14725	3771	Its going to take more than one person to remove the music, magazines,etc., from the library	4
14726	3771	Music in the library is good because you can't find old music like in the @DATE1's in a music store	5
14727	3771	If someone finds music offensive in the libary it might be because they don't know the history from where the music came from or what the artist has been through	6
14728	3771	Say for instance the person is offended by hip hop music	7
14729	3771	I'm sure there's a book for that and the person can look up where the music came from	8
14730	3771	Maybe then they wouldn't be so offeneded	9
14731	3771	Magaizines in the library are really for people who love the media	10
14732	3771	There are so many magaizines that have interesting facts about what happen or what's going to happen	11
14733	3771	For example @ORGANIZATION1 has all the newest event or something big that happend, just in that one @ORGANIZATION1	12
14734	3771	Then there's advertisments, how would people get money if they didn't put there adverstisment in a @ORGANIZATION1 so people could buy there product	13
14735	3771	If not nobody would buy the products	14
14736	3771	Movies in the library are for teachers to show students	15
14737	3771	Half the stuff in the libary, you can find at blockbuster or walmart	16
14738	3771	It's because the library has old movies and current events that happened years ago	17
14739	3771	They might even have a movie to go with the book the reader has read, but some people are more visual with the movie	18
14740	3771	So they read books	19
14741	3771	Overall I hope the music, magazines, and movies stay on the shelves of the libraries and don't change they way the library is doing things	20
14742	3771	Some books might already be off the shelves that people have complained about or got offeneded by already	21
14743	3771	So its already too late for that	22
14744	3771	But its going to take more than one person to be aganist it	23
14745	3771	So that's my view on taking out music, magazines, and movies out of the library	24
14746	3773	If you are sitting in the librarie and you are minding your doing your homework and studing for a test next hour, I wouldn't thank you would want to be messed with.Would you	0
14747	3773	Well im going to explan what I think about everything that's in the libraries	1
14748	3773	Like some stuff we should have in their and some stuff we shouldn't	2
14749	3773	I beleave you should have no problems with noise or anything while you are trying to study in a librarie	3
14750	3773	There are some things in the world today that alot of people find offensive	4
14751	3773	Their are like people that are offensive and things that go on in our and your area were you live that are really offensive	5
14752	3773	When it comes to our libraries there are some things that need to be change and some thing that don't need bothered	6
14753	3773	There are some book some kids shouldn't be seeing in the libraries but to other people mite enjoy them	7
14754	3773	But I don't beleave that they should be taken off the shelf	8
14755	3773	They just need to be placed better where smaller kids can't get to easy	9
14756	3773	You wouldn't like for some books taken off of the shelf because somebody thought they were not good for kids	10
14757	3773	They just need to be move to a shelf were only bigger kids can get to	11
14758	3773	When I am studying I like to listen to music	12
14759	3773	It helps me think what I am going and calms me down	13
14760	3773	But when I don't have my music playing I don't like when other people have there to loud	14
14761	3773	Thats one thing that need to be changed in the libraries	15
14762	3773	Some movies are really offensive and they should be removed from the shelf	16
14763	3773	Another thing that has been a problem is magazines	17
14764	3773	There are alot of all kinds of magazines with all kinds of stuff to read about and they need to be watched	18
14765	3773	I beleave if anything is offensive it should be taken off the shelf	19
14766	3773	Some people freak out every easy and this world is every offensive and people need to think about other people	20
14767	3773	If they don't somebody mite take it the wrong way and it could get bad	21
14768	3774	I disagree that certain material, books,movies, or magazines should be removed that are offensive to some from the shelves of libraries	0
14769	3774	There are three reasons why I argue this topic	1
14770	3774	One reason is that books, music, etc	2
14771	3774	that are inappropiate should not be in a section that a child would go and look for a book	3
14772	3774	A second reason is that for a child to check-out a book and the book is inappropiate, they should have identification to show that they are of age	4
14773	3774	The third reason I think that things like that should stay on shelves is because adults have books, movies, music,etc	5
14774	3774	for them for many reasons	6
14775	3774	Ther should be nothing inappropiate in a library that a child can get a hold of	7
14776	3774	A child should only have things appropiate that they can grab so parents do not have to be worried about the things they child hear, see, or read	8
14777	3774	There are some libraries that will let a child get a magazine or book, and let the child check the book or magazine out	9
14778	3774	This is where th problem begin	10
14779	3774	All libraries should identitify each child when they check-out a book, magazine, or music	11
14780	3774	that why movies are rated, so that a parent could what kind of movie their going to be watching	12
14781	3774	A parent should keep a close eye on what their child read or see	13
14782	3774	I think that things inappropiate should stay on shelves, but I also think it shoud stay in the adult section of the library	14
14783	3774	Childeren should not be able to go in the section for the adults	15
14784	3774	The inappropiate things on the shelves could be useful for the adults in some cases	16
14785	3774	There are some material that a  adult @MONTH1 need to help in life	17
14786	3774	In conclusion, childeren should not be able to get a hold of  inappropiate material in a library, all libraries should identify someone the inappropiate material,and adults should be able to have this type of material on shelves in libraries	18
14787	3775	If you were an author, would you think it would be fair for someone to have your creation taken off the shelves because it offended someone	0
14788	3775	In my opinion, I believe that there are some references, considering movies, books, music, magazines, and more, that are inapropriate	1
14789	3775	However, I don't think anyone should have the right to take them off the shelves because they are offended by it	2
14790	3775	If everyone had the right to take something off of a shelf because it offends them, we wouldn't have anything left	3
14791	3775	In my mind, everything could possibly be offensive to someone	4
14792	3775	For example, I read a book and they stereotyped the cheerleaders, just like everyone else does	5
14793	3775	The way they make all cheerleaders out to be is horrible	6
14794	3775	Considering I've been a big time cheerleader my entire life, I got a little offended because I'm not the way the book described them at all	7
14795	3775	After reading the book, I might not have enjoyed it, but it was my choice to read it	8
14796	3775	I wasn't going to @MONTH1 back to the book store and demand them to take it off the market because I, only one person, didn't like it	9
14797	3775	My philosophy would be to just ignore the things you don't like, or not to purchase the item if it offends you	10
14798	3775	I know that the age of the targeted audience of some books or movies aren't always the only ones that come across them	11
14799	3775	For example, a child coming across a movie that includes inapropriate languages or scenes	12
14800	3775	That is when I say that you just have to keep walking by and only pay attention to the materials that are for you	13
14801	3775	Or parents, censor what you children see, hear and read about	14
14802	3775	Moreover, I do not think it is fair for someone's artwork, whether it is music, a book, magazine, or movie, to be taken off of display or off of the shelf	15
14803	3775	Those authors or creaters worked just as hard as anyone else	16
14804	3775	Just because it is not best suited for one person, does not mean it isn't suited for someone else	17
14805	3775	In conclusion, I don't think it is fair for items to be taken off of the market because it doesn't please a few people	18
14806	3775	I'm sure there is someone out there that will enjoy it	19
14807	3775	It wouldn't be fair to the artist, after all of their time and harkwork	20
14808	3775	Everything on the market could probably offend at least a few people in some way, but welcome to the real world	21
14809	3775	They just need to learn to deal with it, or ignore it like I do.	22
14810	3776	Without books we all would not know what we know now.Its just like saying without a heart your body will still function	0
14811	3776	Books today are basically telling you real life things that happen or can happen if you do anything	1
14812	3776	Personally books are made for a reason, whether some people like it or not	2
14813	3776	Books help you get a better understanding of many things someone else @MONTH1 not know,and or understand.The same thing goes for musis, movies, and magazines	3
14814	3776	I clearly understand where some parents, guardians, and caregivers come from, but they have to realize that everything they think is wrong for our society today really is helping the next person	4
14815	3776	Also someone else is thinking different then they are	5
14816	3776	Books are another way of learning as well, they all are not bad for the younger or whosoever it @MONTH1 be	6
14817	3776	They also help you get a better meaning of alot of things	7
14818	3776	I am not only going to say that books are most peoples main problem, but there are some movies, music,and magazines	8
14819	3776	But some tell you what age it is suitable for	9
14820	3776	For movies they tell you things like '@NUM1, @CAPS1' and other things like that	10
14821	3776	Also for music all you have to do is look at the songs on the back or they have them with or without anything bad on it	11
14822	3776	Magazines they have many different varieties of things for all ages and you pick the ones you want for you or your child	12
14823	3776	Everything is not all bad, it is what you feel is right for your child or whosoever it @MONTH1 be	13
14824	3776	You can not blame others for what they feel needs to be heard or said to some	14
14825	3776	You have to look outside the box and know that there are people who really need to hear, see, and or do	15
14826	3776	Just to better themselves as a individual	16
14827	3776	People are so quick to judge the next but really don't try to understand that everyone needs help and that just because your life or whatever @MONTH1 seem to be heading in the right direction at that time doesn't mean someone elses can't change.Those things are there for a reason if you dont like it then try a better way to get away from it	17
14828	3776	Without those things in our life I really can see this world falling apart	18
14829	3776	We barely understand what some of the books, music, movies, and magazines are talking about so just try to  picture all that being taken away	19
14830	3776	Its not a pretty site, accept the things that we have now and use them to the best of your ability	20
14831	3776	They all are there for a reason.	21
14832	3777	Materials that are offensive for some people in my point of view should not be removed from the shelves	0
14833	3777	If some people are offended by materials they shouldn't pay any mind to those certain materials	1
14834	3777	If everybody paid attention too offensive entertainment regardless to what kind, people would be upset all the time	2
14835	3777	There are many things people see, hear, and read about that @MONTH1 be offensive	3
14836	3777	Don't take everything seriously most of those offensive things @MONTH1 just be a joke or just someone trying to get attention	4
14837	3777	When you just sit and think about it, most television shows you would watch everyday @MONTH1 have at least one moment that's says something offensive	5
14838	3777	In example I watch a television show some nights that says something racial about @CAPS1-@CAPS2	6
14839	3777	I don't pay the show any kind of attention because I know it's a show their just trying to get more rating	7
14840	3777	So when it really comes down too it I am goin to be watching the same show again the next night	8
14841	3777	What if some of our most historical people had listened to everything that everyone esle said about them	9
14842	3777	Then, our black culture and history wouldn't be so '@CAPS3' today	10
14843	3777	I probably wouldn't be able too take this test that im doing right now	11
14844	3777	So don't take everything so serious everyone has some type of  humor	12
14845	3777	If we removed everything that was offensive today	13
14846	3777	Some of your favorite actors and singers wouldn't be the famous actors or singers you love and respect today	14
14847	3777	All of the grammy's and award shows that we watch on television would not be themselves	15
14848	3777	There are all kinds of different genre of music	16
14849	3777	Some of the words that different artists use would be offensive but they still release those same songs because they're only words	17
14850	3777	My conclusion, is that anything and anyone can be offended or offensive	18
14851	3777	People don't take everything serious because it might just be a joke or some ignorant person that needs attention	19
14852	3777	When I was younger my mother always said 'sticks and stones @MONTH1 break your bones but words only make you'	20
14853	3777	So don't take everything serious I mean it's only the media, tell me who does take them seriously	21
14854	3778	Dear @CAPS1, The things we learn at such a young age really need to be changed	0
14855	3778	It would really help soicity.Here are some ways how	1
14856	3778	All books are diffrent	2
14857	3778	Some @MONTH1 have offencive language	3
14858	3778	If books have offenceive language you dont have to read it outloud	4
14859	3778	You can always substitute other words in there for those or just skip over them like nothing happened	5
14860	3778	Some books say sexual things in them that @MONTH1 offend a race of some type or a gender	6
14861	3778	If books are sexual for your age group then I would recomend choosing a new book	7
14862	3778	But no matter how you look at it	8
14863	3778	It could always be much worse than what it is	9
14864	3778	Music music needs to be some cencorship on that	10
14865	3778	When your listening to the radio or a cd or ipod	11
14866	3778	You cant always censor that	12
14867	3778	the radio compianies need to do a better job at censoring them out of songs	13
14868	3778	Many young teens think its cool to use vulgor language	14
14869	3778	Movies have diffrent ratings for diffrent age group	15
14870	3778	I'm sure no one would let a two year old watch a rated @CAPS2 movie	16
14871	3778	That kid would have nightmares for a week	17
14872	3778	so censorship woukd really help the parents out on choosing the right movie for family night instead of picking one that they have no clue about	18
14873	3778	Magazines are nothing but gossip	19
14874	3778	Most magazines do nothing but talk about the bad in people or the good in them.There should be some censorship in there because it is a persons life who there talking garbage	20
14875	3778	Some say kids are like sponges	21
14876	3778	Whatever the kid hears he will repeat	22
14877	3778	Whatever a kid sees he will try to repeat it	23
14878	3778	So whatever a kid reads or watches will probably be the same	24
14879	3778	Things do need a little censorship	25
14880	3778	If we didnt have that its hard telling what the world would be like	26
14881	3778	The world would be full of a lot of people with no motivation what so ever and if we take things away then the world would have nothing to do.I know that when I was a little kid I would hear somthing on the radio and think it was cool to say	27
14882	3778	My parents would'nt know what to do to me	28
14883	3778	I kjnow as an adult i would'nt want my kids learning the stuff I did at such a young age.	29
14884	3780	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3, I am a student from @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, I do think that certain materials such as books	0
14885	3780	music, movies, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because, some students read book on a daily basics and reading also keep some students out of trouble	1
14886	3780	The @CAPS8 I say that is because if you find a book you might be interesting in the book and you might share @CAPS2 with you youger sisters or brothers to keep them from doing the wrong things	2
14887	3780	Also some books that are offensive shows students to not do the things they see in the book	3
14888	3780	Some books that are offensive show how people that do bad thing have to pay the cost and people can learn from other people mistakes	4
14889	3780	Some books that are offensive show people what to do or what not to do so you wouldn' t have to pay that cost from doing something wrong	5
14890	3780	Also music can be offensive because of the curseing that some of the songs have in @CAPS2.The music is sometimes good to listen to because songs speak and takes action in a certain way.The offensive part about the music is that some music is calm music and @CAPS2 keeps you motivated inside and some music have bad vibes to @CAPS2 and can make you do bad things.Most of the time music can make you happy and you can undertsand alot in life just by listening to music	6
14891	3780	Music is a description of life meaning that life is ful of offensive things but you have to be very selfcentered to understand	7
14892	3780	Some movies can also be offensive because of the actions in the movies	8
14893	3780	Movies are enjoyable and you can also relate to some movies in your own way	9
14894	3780	At times movies can be very interesting because of the actions and drama in the movies	10
14895	3780	The titles in the movie can also be offensive but that don't mean the movie is a bad relation in the story	11
14896	3780	Magazines can also be offensive because of the things inside of the magazine	12
14897	3780	Some magazines shows appropriate things that children and adults can relate to	13
14898	3780	Also there are different things like activitys and things for family and freinds to enjoy	14
14899	3780	Many magazines are different in there own way @CAPS2 depends on how the cover is and the person who created the magzine	15
14900	3780	Some things are good about magazines because they show you posters of some of the super stars in the music career	16
14901	3780	There are alot of things that can be offensive in the world but you have to learn how to seperate yourself from the negative things in life	17
14902	3780	Also all things are not offensive because you can relate to some of the books and music that we here in these days	18
14903	3780	The most important thing is that you don't have to listen what the magazines and movies are telling you because, you have a mind of your own	19
14904	3780	People don't listen to what the books and etc, are going by because some of the things they are talking about is false information	20
14905	3780	So thats why i say @CAPS7 i do believe that cartain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	21
14906	3780	Sincerly,                                                            @ORGANIZATION1	22
14907	3781	Removing literature from a shelf should not be permitted just because you think something about it	0
14908	3781	Everyone has different ideas and opinions about what is appropriate and what is not appropriate	1
14909	3781	If you don't like a certain book or you do not want your children reading that book then don't take them to the library in the first place	2
14910	3781	In a public library you have to be old enough to buy a library card to check out a book, so if you are old enough to have a library card then obviously you arent going to find a book that is innapropriate for your own age	3
14911	3781	You @MONTH1 find a book that is immature to you, but you do not have to read it	4
14912	3781	Men and women go to public libraries to learn	5
14913	3781	If you want to learn about something that is offensive, then you won't beable to if one person comes along and doesn't approve of the book	6
14914	3781	Is that fair	7
14915	3781	You tell me	8
14916	3781	In a school library yes there should be a limit to what children can and cannot read	9
14917	3781	In a junior high school the standards should be different compared to an elementary or a senior high school	10
14918	3781	In an elementary children are required to read as part of their academics, but they are not old enough to want to learn about something offensive, therefore they will not need those types of books in their library	11
14919	3781	In a junior high school there should be a limit on the offensiveness but the students still have a right to know what is going on arond them	12
14920	3781	In a senior high school students should have a right to read whatever type of book they please	13
14921	3781	Magazines are a different subject	14
14922	3781	Alot of times in magazines there are advertisements for smoking products or alchoholic beverages	15
14923	3781	Those types of magazines should not beable to be read in a school library	16
14924	3781	In a public library a person should have the right to read whatever he or she pleases	17
14925	3781	In the end im saying adults and teens have a right to learn about whatever they like, but children should be young and innocent while they can	18
14926	3781	You cannot keep them shielded from commercials and people advertising these things themselves, but what you can prevent you should	19
14927	3781	Nobody wants their children growing up too fast, but do not limit their growth.	20
14928	3782	People all around the world think differently about music, books, and movies	0
14929	3782	Some think that books and music should have different kinds of ratings	1
14930	3782	Some people think that a song should be rated '@CAPS1' for mature when others could think that it shouldn't have any rating at all	2
14931	3782	Level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for	3
14932	3782	Level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into	4
14933	3782	If everyone could pull off a book or magazine, etc then there would be no books left	5
14934	3782	This is why we have levels of maturty on the material	6
14935	3782	Levels are letters, such as '@CAPS1' for mature	7
14936	3782	'@CAPS1' means that their will probably be some naked and sexual play into the video or song	8
14937	3782	With this on their it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it they can take it away	9
14938	3782	This leaves the parent with some control over what kids can watch and hear	10
14939	3782	Stores won't let kids under the age of @NUM1 buy a rated @CAPS4 movie	11
14940	3782	Rated @CAPS4 stands for sexual act, language, and blood	12
14941	3782	It can stand for more things such as drugs	13
14942	3782	I am happy that my nine year old can't buy a rated @CAPS4 movie, but senice the law says a @NUM1 year old kid should be aloud to watch it, then its saying they should be mature enough to see or hear it	14
14943	3782	We should be happy that we can have some control over what are children watch and listen too	15
14944	3782	We could try getting rid of all bad books, movies etc, but over time I'@CAPS1 sure more will be made	16
14945	3782	I am also sure that over time we will find a old copy of a book on a website	17
14946	3782	We cannot save our kids their whole life, so over time we have got to let them grow up	18
14947	3782	Our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch	19
14948	3782	We just have to raise them the best we can.	20
14949	3783	Does censorship really helf or setback our libraries	0
14950	3783	Does it try to mask @CAPS7 really might be happening in this world or does it try to make you feel all happy about this horrendous place that you live in	1
14951	3783	To one person a book could be very offensive and to their neighbor it could have a whole new, opposite meaning	2
14952	3783	Its all in perspective	3
14953	3783	Personally, i think that taking out some of the 'offensive' book in libraries could be a diaster	4
14954	3783	In one book that we read this year in my @CAPS1 class was '@CAPS2 @NUM1'	5
14955	3783	This book was all about a distopia where people burnt books who didn't send the right message to society	6
14956	3783	People were numb to feelings and that could be the outcome of censorship in the libraries around the @LOCATION1	7
14957	3783	Libraries are a place that sparks imangination for all ages and if you censor things out then how is that suppose to happen	8
14958	3783	Looking at books in the past that were defied as 'offensive' and taken off of the shelves at libraries and banned to read in @CAPS1 class at school, were mostly about womens rights and @CAPS3 @CAPS4	9
14959	3783	Some of then just had bad words in them and others about dystopias	10
14960	3783	If you took out all af those books that pertained to these topics how many books would you ave left	11
14961	3783	And for that matter, my best friend is an @CAPS3 @CAPS6 girl and we both have equal rights now and we both have jobs so @CAPS7 is the big deal with living in the past	12
14962	3783	Theres is also the fact that it is innevitable to get away from cursing everywhere you go	13
14963	3783	All along the streets, in schools and sometimes even in church	14
14964	3783	So if you are around it in real life then why can't you read about it	15
14965	3783	Now when people who are all for the cenorship in libraries say something to the affect of ' @CAPS7 about the children, i dont want them reading a book that i think is offensive,' i say then cenor them	16
14966	3783	Its your own choice on how you raise your kids but other parents think that you should have an imagination instead of the same old, same old	17
14967	3783	Its good to have a varity of things to read that doesn't limit the brain	18
14968	3783	All in all, i think people who would want to censor books are crazy and it could potentually be taken way out of hand and then a distpoia society would form	19
14969	3783	Children should not be dissillusioned on @CAPS7 the world is and could be	20
14970	3783	Think about that next time that you think a book could arise tension between people and think are you taking away rights of other	21
14971	3784	In the literary world of today it is never hard to find a topic that will interest you	0
14972	3784	Science fiction, thriller, romance, how to build a car with household materials and many more topics all await you at your nearest bookstore or library	1
14973	3784	With this vast array of topics it isn't that surprising that you will find some authors that have decided to go against the norms of society and write a book that is controversial in the ideas that it presents	2
14974	3784	These books will often get put on a 'burn list' or censorship list and will be taken off the shelves of the local libraries in order to protect the patrons of those institutions from those books' ideas	3
14975	3784	Many have argued that this is a way of keeping the society pure, but this censorship of literary works is probably one of the biggest mistakes a civilization can make	4
14976	3784	Removing books from the shelves off a library is a form of censorship, which is a clear violation of the @CAPS1	5
14977	3784	In the @LOCATION1, everyone has certain unalienable rights	6
14978	3784	These were written out in our @CAPS1 as the first ten admendments to the @CAPS1	7
14979	3784	One of those rights is the freedom of speech, or the right to voice your opinion	8
14980	3784	By remving a book from the shelf of a library, you are silencing the author of that book and thus taking away that author's freedom of speech	9
14981	3784	This clearly violates the @CAPS1 and thus is unconstitutional and illegal in the @LOCATION1	10
14982	3784	By violating the @CAPS1 openly, this opens the door for other areas to be violated in the @CAPS1	11
14983	3784	The president is now a dictator, we are now a communist country, and many other actions are allowed, leaving the @CAPS1 as a scrap of paper with no meaning	12
14984	3784	Without the @CAPS1, the @LOCATION1 is just like any other country and has no direction	13
14985	3784	This leads to a downward spiral of our society	14
14986	3784	The silencing of the voices of authors also stops new ideas from coming in to a society	15
14987	3784	Every year thousands of new books are introduced to the @CAPS8 public	16
14988	3784	Many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future	17
14989	3784	If you take these books off the shelves, and out of the publics hands, you effectivly stop all change from new ideas in a society	18
14990	3784	Nothing would ever get better, and the society would stay at the same level that they were when the censorship began	19
14991	3784	Censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society	20
14992	3784	In the novel '@CAPS9 @NUM1' by @PERSON1, the censorship of books has gone so far that all the great literary works of the world are banned	21
14993	3784	Anyone who is caught reading a book that 'makes the think' locked up or killed	22
14994	3784	The main characters job as a fireman is not to put out fires, but to set books on fire that encourage people to think	23
14995	3784	The censorship of that society had gone so far that no one did anything, they just sat at home and watched the television all day	24
14996	3784	Many people will argue that pornography is something that should be censored out of society, but the problem is once you start censoring, where do you stop	25
14997	3784	Censoring out pornography would lead to romance novels being censored, which would lead to magic books being censored, and so on until you are censoring out @CAPS10 @CAPS11 or the @CAPS12	26
14998	3784	By censoring out the books and movies that make people think, you quickly lose all intrest in higher learning	27
14999	3784	That is why censorsip can quickly lead to the collapse of a society	28
15000	3784	Although censorship @MONTH1 seem like a good idea, it is really one of the largest mistakes a society can make	29
15001	3784	It can lead to the silencing of all the voices of change in a society causing society to grind to halt and stay right were it is	30
15002	3784	Not only is it determental to a society but it is also is clearly unconstitutional if you look at the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1	31
15003	3784	So let us hope that all though we @MONTH1 play with the idea of censorship, that we never go down that winding road to no where	32
15004	3786	'Book or no Book?' Certain studies have shown that there are many people in this world that have many diffrent intrest	0
15005	3786	Wheather that be cars, boats, toys, or animals it shouldn't matter what the intrest is	1
15006	3786	I firmly beleive that a library should have books over tons of things	2
15007	3786	Just because one person might not agree with it doesn't mean that another should not be able to read or possible learn about it	3
15008	3786	This is a on going debate nation wide and there is going to have to be a decision made fast!	4
15009	3786	There are to many people making enimies all over the world	5
15010	3786	I was asked to submit my opinion and i beleive that they should be allowed to check out any book that they want too	6
15011	3786	If the opposite person does not agree with the fact that those books are being checked outh then they don't have to watch it	7
15012	3786	There are multiple solutions to the problem	8
15013	3786	The librarys could have diffrent sections for diffrent types of books or such as sorting them by class or hobbies	9
15014	3786	There could also be age limits so that kids don't get ahold of anyting that they shouldn't be watching or reading.That way the other people would never even have to see the books that he or she does not agree with	10
15015	3786	Well i cant wait to see how the results turn out!	11
15016	3786	I also hope they people make the right vote	12
15017	3786	Im not saying that my vote is the only way, its just my opinion	13
15018	3786	Either way there will be angry people and people that will be bursting with joy	14
15019	3786	So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 for letting me voice my opinion!	15
15020	3787	I think that all books that are found offensive or sexual shouldn't be taken off the shelves completely	0
15021	3787	I just think that they should be placed in a certain section of the library where kids should not be at or not allowed to go in like a section only for adults	1
15022	3787	I think if a kis see something they think is interestiong and will teach them something they didnt know before they're going to pick it up no matter what unless someone steps in and tells them not to	2
15023	3787	I dont think kids should be exposed to all of that and some kids are getting ahead were they shouldn't be in life	3
15024	3787	If a kid decides to try and check out a book like that either they shall have an i.d	4
15025	3787	or there parent should be with them comfirming they are able to check out that book	5
15026	3787	Many children I think are already exposed to things they shouldn't be around and books like that would just make it all worse	6
15027	3787	Some books send out really bad messages but then again that's only for adults to read it should be kept out of the way of children	7
15028	3787	Some kids could live in a fanasy world and have a split personality or something off of things like that and it could really affect someone badly	8
15029	3787	If a parent wants there kid to have the book or dont mind anything about it then that's there choice they have permission	9
15030	3787	I know I wouldnt want my kids around that untill they were @NUM1 years of age or older but I know some parents dont really care alot about it	10
15031	3787	So my best solution for this problem is to keep those books and things out of the reach of children or have a specific age limit.	11
15032	3788	Throughout my life, I have seen many books that seem offensive to me	0
15033	3788	However, they should not be censored just because they seem offensive	1
15034	3788	I believe that books that are found offensive should not be censored	2
15035	3788	A reason why I think books that are found offensive should not be censored is because what seems offensive to one person, @MONTH1 not be offensive to another	3
15036	3788	Classifying something as offensive is an opinion	4
15037	3788	Unless everyone in the whole world thought that a book was offensive, it should be able to remain open to the public	5
15038	3788	Another reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is because in our @LOCATION1, we are given the right to express ourselves freely	6
15039	3788	If we censored books that are found to be offensive, we would be violating this right	7
15040	3788	This would not be fair to the people who wrote the books and to those who like them	8
15041	3788	The next reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is that if we were to censor every book that we found offensive, we would not have any books to read at all	9
15042	3788	Books that some people like are found offensive by others	10
15043	3788	For example, suppose a few people loved the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 series but another person who read it later found it offensive and had it censored	11
15044	3788	The people who loved the @ORGANIZATION1 series would now find the books the other person likes and censor them	12
15045	3788	If this continued, we would have no books to read	13
15046	3788	Another reason why I believe books should not be censored is because without offensive books, we would never learn from terrible mistakes	14
15047	3788	Suppose every book relating to both world wars were censored and could not be read	15
15048	3788	Sooner or later, no one would remember what terrible things happpened and history could possibly repeat itself	16
15049	3788	Unless having books that seem offensive is worse than having the events we dread happen again, then books that are found offensive should not be censored	17
15050	3788	I believe books that are found to be offensive should not be censored because without them, we would be violating the right to freely express ourselves and we would be allowing terrible things that happened in the past to be forgotten	18
15051	3788	Without books that are considered offensive, we would not have any books to read at all	19
15052	3789	They will see it eventually	0
15053	3789	There is no reason to censor a library, I believe	1
15054	3789	I think they should be sectioned off, maybe put the 'offensive' books in the back  of the libarary is enough censorship	2
15055	3789	You have to look at it in the publishers view also	3
15056	3789	They want to sell and advertise their product and they have a right to do so	4
15057	3789	Libraries shouldn't take their product off the shelves just because someone stumbled apon something they believe is offensive	5
15058	3789	We all know what offensive things we could find in a library or a bookstore like @ORGANIZATION1	6
15059	3789	Things that show innaproperate pictures, drugs, firearms..ect	7
15060	3789	I believe they are already censored enough	8
15061	3789	Most of magazines that many people find 'offensive' are always put in the back of the store or secetioned off so people don't stumble upon it or have their childern flipping threw the pages corrupting their minds	9
15062	3789	Some material are even put in a plastic sleve so the person must puchase it before reading	10
15063	3789	If you decide to write and publish a book, don't you think you should be given the right as everyone else to put it on the shelves and promote it	11
15064	3789	I do, there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to	12
15065	3789	The library shouldn't censor your book just because someone else thinks and feels it's offensive	13
15066	3789	That's not fair in @LOCATION1	14
15067	3789	I think that the libraries shouldn't censor any materials	15
15068	3789	offensive or not we have the write to publish and promote it	16
15069	3790	I don't think they should publically exploit the books if certain people feel offended by it, but I personally do not get offended by anything so my opinion will be different than others	0
15070	3790	However, if the library recieves constant complaints about this issue then I could see why they would want to get rid of it	1
15071	3790	So what i'm saying is that if it doesn't cause a problem for anyone other then a select few then I believe they should keep it but just let the offended know that the book  is going to be out of sight, therefore making the issue non-existant	2
15072	3790	I don't think that librarians will intentually put out books that offend the public people on display in front of everyone to see, I believe that they just have the books for their purpose and that's to be read	3
15073	3790	I've been to the public library many times and out of all the times i've been I dont think i have seen a single thing that has offended me or made me un-comfortable	4
15074	3790	The books are there for public reading and the growth of knowledge, without them I believe it would hurt our nation as a whole, due to the fact that we need knowledge to do things and the more knowledge we have the better our lives will be	5
15075	3790	So no, I believe libraries should keep all books unless it causes a big issue and many people are constantly bringing up the problem.	6
15076	3791	I think that everyone has different views on different things so I dont think that they should be because if they would be that would be against the first amendment where it says everyone have the freedom of religion and speech	0
15077	3791	If you disagree with the book or whatever it @MONTH1 be you can just ignore it and keep walking and never have to pay any attention to it	1
15078	3791	People these days are taking things way to far with their opinions	2
15079	3791	People need to mind their own business and stop thinking the world revolves around them	3
15080	3791	There several billion people in the @LOCATION1 and every person looks at thing slightly different and this should be taken into consideration when the get mad just because there is a book or movie on the shelf of the library	4
15081	3791	For example I like movies with comedy and sometimes a scary movie but girls @MONTH1 not like scary movies and @MONTH1 like movies with droma or somthing in that line	5
15082	3791	Just because we like different things doesn't mean we should have to put just a so certain kind of books or movies on the shelf	6
15083	3791	Yes, there are movies that I dont like because they stand for things that are against my religion but I dont stand around and say no one should watch these movies because just because I dont beleive in them doesn't mean I should judge other people for it	7
15084	3791	I know some people feel that everyone one should look at things the same way as they do and everyone should should agree and get along but that is not how it is and no matter how much you want people to agree and get along it will never happen	8
15085	3791	I think people need to mind their own business and let people read, listen to, and watch whatever they want to and it should not affend anyone	9
15086	3791	I know people like to think that they know everything there is to know just because they have their own ways and thoughts	10
15087	3791	People like this you can argue with and you will never win the arguement and you can never get them to understand how you look at it	11
15088	3791	They just think think my way is the right way and the only way	12
15089	3791	This is the way I feel about people getting mad when there is a book or movie on the shelf that they dont not agree with	13
15090	3791	I just think that evryone should try to undersatnd what you are saying and listen to you instead of ignoring you	14
15091	3791	I feel this way but I am not a person that is tuck in their ways where you cant change their mind.	15
15092	3792	I believe that if something is found offense to someone then it dosent mean its offense to someone else	0
15093	3792	In libraries there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc, some of these different type of things @MONTH1 come across as offesnse to some but others @MONTH1 enjoy it	1
15094	3792	Therefore it shouldnt be taken away from those who enjoy reading or listening to these things	2
15095	3792	Some things such as adult novels and explict music are things people consider to be offensive	3
15096	3792	But what they dont understand is that some people actually enjoy listening or reading this material so taking it away from them is not right	4
15097	3792	Everyone should be able to have different likes in these areas	5
15098	3792	Everyone is not the same	6
15099	3792	If you attend a library you should be able to find something that fits your style or sparks your intrest	7
15100	3792	If the things that people like are being taken away then its not giving them a wide variety of things they enjoy doing	8
15101	3792	Its more likely closing them out on things they like because other people dont like it or find it offensive	9
15102	3792	Lastly, those that think that these things are offensive are entitled to there opinion	10
15103	3792	But so are those that believe that these things are good	11
15104	3792	There should remain a variety of different books, music, and other things that appeal to all types of personalities	12
15105	3792	Everyone has a right to say weither they dont like something	13
15106	3792	But what you dont like someone else does	14
15107	3792	So to take away things that other people enjoy is unjust.	15
15108	3793	A colossal number of significant and life-changing books can be found in the millions of libraries throughout the world	0
15109	3793	The big question is whether or not individuals should get rid of the books of lesser importance, and the books that are found offensive to a number of people	1
15110	3793	In my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of	2
15111	3793	That is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion	3
15112	3793	Although Katherine Paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, I strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves	4
15113	3793	Race is an extremely important topic in the world today, and I believe books that discrimate against certain ethnicity's need to be removed immediately from libraries	5
15114	3793	@CAPS2, there are exceptions to this proposal	6
15115	3793	For instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events	7
15116	3793	Unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they @MONTH1 offend people	8
15117	3793	In that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves	9
15118	3793	Secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public	10
15119	3793	It is important that we teach our children the difference between right and wrong at a young age, and if the kids hear some of the derogatory music on the shelves, they will lose all sense of what is right and wrong	11
15120	3793	As Katherine Paterson mentions in her quote,' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1, that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries	12
15121	3793	By libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families	13
15122	3793	Overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music	14
15123	3793	Lastly, Katherine Paterson says that if we keep removing offensive books from the shelves, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2, that is a nieve comment as @CAPS1 as an exaggeration	15
15124	3793	There are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries	16
15125	3793	Therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that	17
15126	3793	When people are at the check out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive	18
15127	3793	If the same item appears regularly on the list, remove the item	19
15128	3793	That would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved	20
15129	3793	In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately	21
15130	3793	One highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed	22
15131	3793	Certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as @CAPS1	23
15132	3793	A quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive	24
15133	3793	Ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society	25
15134	3794	Do I believe that certain materials should be taken off book sheleves if found offensive	0
15135	3794	There are many answers to this question and many people have different views to the question	1
15136	3794	For instance, you have to look at all of the different races, customs, and more of what people believe in to find the true answer	2
15137	3794	Some materials are very offensive, but should they be taken off the shelves of our very own libraries	3
15138	3794	There are thousands of books in a library, and hundreds are written every single year	4
15139	3794	These books range from romance, action packed, and scary	5
15140	3794	Now many books are starting to be found offensive to our society today	6
15141	3794	I have read many books and have not found hardly any book to ever be offensive	7
15142	3794	There are offensive things in other matierals such as: music, movies, and magazines	8
15143	3794	I do recall listening to music, watching movies and reading magazines and not liking what i was doing at all	9
15144	3794	Some music today is just extremely bad	10
15145	3794	From the fowl language and missinterpretation of words, music has become worse	11
15146	3794	Some movies that I have watched are not very well either	12
15147	3794	Movies can be offensive in many other ways than any other material there is	13
15148	3794	You got the scary, gorry and the movies with all of the different sex scenes that are made every year	14
15149	3794	This can teach the younger kids what is wrong and right, as well let them be aware of what life is about	15
15150	3794	I do believe that all of these materials should stay on the shelves of our libraries	16
15151	3794	Learning from books, music, movies, and magazines is good in a way	17
15152	3794	Knowing that many things in this world today are offensive to people, I think that it can only make our society stronger to help us understand all of the different views that our people have	18
15153	3794	Yes it can go in bad directions, but there are many ways to get people to understand what is right and what is wrong to push them to stride for the best	19
15154	3794	Knowing that materials on our shelves are offensive, I still believe that the right thing to do is to keep them there	20
15155	3794	Clearly people get mad and upset when reading, listening, or watching these materials, but this is what makes us who we are	21
15156	3794	There will always be offensive stuff being said written and so on, but the way you can handle it yourself will show everyone around you that it is possible to change their own views of the offensive matter and look at it the better way.	22
15157	3795	In the quote that @PERSON1 wrote she talks about how books can be taken down from a shelf if it is too provokative	0
15158	3795	This is a very interesting quote	1
15159	3795	She talks about how things should be taken of the shelf to prevent the children from seeing it	2
15160	3795	In everyday life there are things that are said in movies, music, and magazines that kids should never watch, hear or read	3
15161	3795	Some movies can be way too provokative	4
15162	3795	Directors try and cover them up, but we know what they are trying to get across	5
15163	3795	Some scenes can get out of control and there is no stopping it	6
15164	3795	People wish they could close their eyes and it would all be over	7
15165	3795	When parents get movies they try and keep those scenes hidden from their children	8
15166	3795	The parents do not want to get their child having bad ideas of what the movies are saying	9
15167	3795	To many children take the movies to the extreme and try and act like the actors or actresses, and the children end up getting hurt from these actions	10
15168	3795	Music is especially one to do this	11
15169	3795	There are not a lot of  songs in the world that do not involve language, drugs, or sexual content in it	12
15170	3795	Many parents do not want them to be exeposed to that way to soon	13
15171	3795	If people listen to this they might want to try it and end up going down a wrong path from these words that are said	14
15172	3795	Mothers do not want to go get their child out of jail from doing something that was just like the song they like to listen to	15
15173	3795	That is not a mothers dream to go and do that	16
15174	3795	There are too many magazines that try and expose women	17
15175	3795	They use this to try and see more magazines	18
15176	3795	This is wrong to do	19
15177	3795	A little while back a magazine took pictures of a girl and tried to expose her, this is just wrong	20
15178	3795	Parents do not want their children to look at this and get the wrong idea	21
15179	3795	When girls look at a model in a magazine they try and be just like the model	22
15180	3795	They girls end up being underweight, sick, and maybe do drugs	23
15181	3795	Parents if they see this should take the magazine away from them if it is not what they approve	24
15182	3795	Some parents let their kids get away with too much	25
15183	3795	They should censor what their children do	26
15184	3795	Some kids will try and get around them so there is not helping them	27
15185	3795	Everyones point of view is different	28
15186	3795	People @MONTH1 think that this scene is to provocative and another person @MONTH1 look at that and say there is nothing wrong	29
15187	3795	It just depends on how society feels about the whole situation	30
15188	3795	If we were to take a movie or music down because of what they say then there would be no contents on the shelf	31
15189	3796	Libraries are a great resource for information all around the world	0
15190	3796	They contain many different styles and genres of books	1
15191	3796	Some might not be appropriate for young children to read	2
15192	3796	There are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves	3
15193	3796	I believe that no book should be denied of this right	4
15194	3796	Most children that go to a library already know what kind of book they want and are with an adult at all times	5
15195	3796	Most libraries have children sections	6
15196	3796	Offensive books are most likely found in the teenager or adults sections, not the children section	7
15197	3796	So, to my defense, there could really be no way that a child would seek out these 'offensive' books anyway	8
15198	3796	Children today are exposed to more explicit topics, but I doubt they would want to read a book about them	9
15199	3796	Next, if a child goes up to the check out desk the librarian should be able to tell their parent or guardian that certain book is not suitable for that age of child	10
15200	3796	Going back to my point of children usually go to libraries with their guardians, they should be supervised at all times while in a library	11
15201	3796	If an adult cares that much about what their child reads they can easily decide what is offensive or not	12
15202	3796	Finally, authors should not be punished for writing something they believe in or like	13
15203	3796	They worked hard on writing and publishing their novels, they should be able to show them off	14
15204	3796	If librarians do take off books for being offensive to some adults, a lot of books will be gone from the shelves	15
15205	3796	The quote used for this essay explains this thought more thoroughly	16
15206	3796	People should be able to read whatever they want, offensive or not	17
15207	3796	Children being able to do this	18
15208	3796	Depends on the parent	19
15209	3796	There is no way a child could check out an offensive book, take it home, and read it without their guardian knowing	20
15210	3796	Yes, all parents do not care about what their child reads, so this could happen	21
15211	3796	Just because some adults complained about books being too offensive for their children doesn't mean a revolt has to happen	22
15212	3796	Those parents should just step up and be more strict about what their child can and cannot read	23
15213	3796	Some of the most 'offensive' books out there are the very best to read.	24
15214	3797	Censorship has become a major part of the media now-a-days	0
15215	3797	It is everywhere: books, movies, songs, and television shows	1
15216	3797	The government is trying to make the children of @DATE1 less corrupt, but they will end up learning everything that is censored for their friends and peers anyways	2
15217	3797	I feel censorship is a waste of time for the government	3
15218	3797	Children learn mature information sooner than they should in @DATE1's society	4
15219	3797	Censorship should be more for the media children and young teens pay attention to	5
15220	3797	It should not be put into more mature movies and music, such as movies with adult content and rap	6
15221	3797	Those are more of items for grown up and teenagers than for children	7
15222	3797	If parents allow their children to listen to and watch that certain media, then they must feel their children are mature enough and know enough to not be majorly effected by it	8
15223	3797	Censorship also ruins the quality of books, music, and movies	9
15224	3797	Certain words help to better express people and their views	10
15225	3797	If they can not use the specific word they feel describes them the best, it tends to ruin the quality of their character	11
15226	3797	People cannot be themselves when they have to watch what they say and are looked down upon because of their choice of language	12
15227	3797	I, myself, am very free with my language and the inappropriate and vulgar things I say	13
15228	3797	They are just a part of my nature and help me to be more expressive of myself	14
15229	3797	There are probably better, more appropriate words to use when I am in public, but then I would not feel like I am being quite myself	15
15230	3797	I think censorship is corrupting our society	16
15231	3797	The government is trying to control us with censorship	17
15232	3797	I am not one of those paranoid people that thinks the government is out to get them	18
15233	3797	This just happens to be one of my opinions of censorship	19
15234	3797	We should get rid of it	20
15235	3797	It is changing the way people are and the way they feel they can act around others	21
15236	3797	People have to be careful of what they say, and I feel that makes speaking and attempting to express yourself so much more challenging	22
15237	3797	Censorship should be stopped before it ruins the quality of all the media.	23
15238	3798	How would you feel if your son or daughter saw a naked picture of someone, kept hearing bad words from a song that was in the library	0
15239	3798	Would you really want that for your child	1
15240	3798	Thought a library was supposed to be a learning center, didnt know it was a bad place to be	2
15241	3798	People have their own opinions in everything	3
15242	3798	A lot of things these days are changing and it's not for the better	4
15243	3798	Television, books, and music are becoming dirty and unenjoyable to people	5
15244	3798	Please help try and help us stop this	6
15245	3798	We don't want it getting to our kids, like it has to others	7
15246	3798	Some people like these kinds of things with bad actions in them	8
15247	3798	One thing that catches them is the beat, it just makes them want to start dancing	9
15248	3798	Another reason why they like it is beacuse their friends like it also	10
15249	3798	People these days are becoming more of followers than leaders like they should be	11
15250	3798	When people grow up they usually have an idol whether its a singer, book writer, or actor	12
15251	3798	When that idol grows older it most likely isnt going to be the same person with the same thoughts it had @DATE1, they change for the worse most of the time	13
15252	3798	They get caught up in drugs or the fame that it puts them in	14
15253	3798	When that happens people loose than interste in them unless they think its cool	15
15254	3798	It all just depends on the person	16
15255	3798	Some people thrive off of these things	17
15256	3798	Libraries are supposed to be for all ages	18
15257	3798	If a kid finds something that was bad at a library and tells their friends or parents thats just putting down the library and they aren't going to want to go there anymore	19
15258	3798	This is just hurting the library because it will loose a lot of their buisness	20
15259	3798	Young kids these days are being expossed to a lot of more things that they should'nt be	21
15260	3798	What little kids already know is sickning	22
15261	3798	Hearing them say that they have boyfriends and girlfriends, and how they know bad words just at the age of @DATE1	23
15262	3798	It might have to do with the parents or the friends the kids choose but in my opinion it's right	24
15263	3798	Kid's are growing up way to fast because of the things that they know	25
15264	3798	Movies, music, books, etc	26
15265	3798	are not like they used to be in the fifty's, even the eighty's, yeah they werent the best, but its gotten a little extreme theses days	27
15266	3798	The words that they say in songs, the things we see in movies, and the picture we see in magazines are getting out of hand	28
15267	3798	There should be a section that is blocked off only for eighteen and older that has all the bad things in the music, movies, and, magazine articles/picture	29
15268	3798	People shoud have id's that they have to have to get into this section	30
15269	3798	This is going to try and prevent kids from seeing what they are these days when they are at a young age	31
15270	3798	This might not even work, but its worth a try	32
15271	3798	The world is'nt a happy place anymore	33
15272	3798	It's filled with violence, sex, drugs, etc	34
15273	3798	Some parents don't care about the things that their child does, says, or sees	35
15274	3798	It all just depends on the family	36
15275	3798	Whether they believe in @CAPS1 or if they don't is another example of this	37
15276	3798	It always affects ther actions and thought	38
15277	3798	People try and do the littlest things, and they try and make a difference in the world	39
15278	3798	That is what people need to do, not get involved in horrible things	40
15279	3798	They need to get involved and stay out of these bad things	41
15280	3798	seeing bad picture, hearing bad words, and watching horrible things in movies	42
15281	3798	Try to make a difference	43
15282	3798	dont be a follower because it's not going ti get you anywhere in life	44
15283	3798	Everything counts!	45
15284	3799	I believe that books should not be taken off the shelves of libraries because without books we would not know anything about life to survive	0
15285	3799	The books and media help the human race sympathize with eachother and know about things that already happend so that we don't repeat history and do it all over again	1
15286	3799	Some books are made up for entertainment and others are for education and help children learn about what happend in the past.Taking books off the shelfs of schools and libraries would be uncalled for because you are taking away from children who have nothing else to turn to besides school and knowing what the teachers are talking about in the classrooms	2
15287	3799	Books that are offensive should be taken off the shelves but not the books that make sense to people and help you suceed in life	3
15288	3799	some schools don't have books to read because they are in a poor country and don't have much to do besides go to school and learn	4
15289	3799	books are important in so many ways that it would be a lot of drama if they took books off of shelves because people all around the world need to know about everything that has been done and the people who done it	5
15290	3799	some books don't make sense but that doesent matter if it does or don't.	6
15291	3800	In todays world there are so meny movies and books that it's hard to watch or read all of them	0
15292	3800	They all have different look and ideas	1
15293	3800	Every one in the world is not all going to like all of the same movies, books, and music we all have different testes	2
15294	3800	That is why I think it wouldn't be right to just take the books or movies off the shelf	3
15295	3800	I think they make so meny different types of ever thing becuse we do have different beliefes like relegen, class, and cultur	4
15296	3800	Music, there is rock, rap, hip-hop, country, jazz, and the list goes on and on	5
15297	3800	And if you just take it of the shelf becuse someone somewhere thought it was offersive we would not have music or any thing like that	6
15298	3800	I don't really have to meny thing that I get offened by but I do know that I have seen some showes that were that way and some people I'm guessing thought was funny	7
15299	3800	Books, there are meny different gerens in that too just like music so if it has a bad work, or a rude annicdout some people @MONTH1 not like it	8
15300	3800	Books are good to read	9
15301	3800	It would be bad if they were all gone	10
15302	3800	Then it would be hard to learn or teach anything	11
15303	3800	Take for an example The @CAPS1 is one of the most read books in the world and if they just took it off the shelf becuse some people don't believe in it so meny things would change and releges are not going to be the same in any way	12
15304	3800	That is the way is going to be with it all and most people do take offens to that	13
15305	3800	The way i put it in my head is that if they don't like it they don't have to read, watch, or leasn to it	14
15306	3800	Every thing in all of these bisnisses is in taking a resk	15
15307	3800	Its all about how you look at books, movies, music, etc	16
15308	3800	So I think that just taking it off the shelf would be a bad chose for this	17
15309	3800	That is why we have our own free will and and make the choes that you want to good or bad, right or wroung	18
15310	3800	You might not think about it much but thing like this do happen it might not be in your town but some where out there in the world it will be happening	19
15311	3802	How would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys	0
15312	3802	If you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out you might begin to feel trapped	1
15313	3802	Everyone in this world is different from the next person	2
15314	3802	So I believe that each person should be able to read any book they would like without any restrictions	3
15315	3802	Some reasons for my opinion are personal values, unique interests, and the fact that people should have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others	4
15316	3802	For my first reason goes along with personal values	5
15317	3802	For example a person of higher authority @MONTH1 find a particular book, magazine, or movie inappropriate due to their values and beliefs	6
15318	3802	So if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic	7
15319	3802	This would make it unfair for the people who do enjoy these topics	8
15320	3802	My next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests	9
15321	3802	If someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable	10
15322	3802	This can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time	11
15323	3802	Everyone likes different things and has different views	12
15324	3802	They should not be forced to read only the things that are selected by another person	13
15325	3802	People should also have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others	14
15326	3802	I know from experience that being ostracized for doing what you enjoy is completely unfair	15
15327	3802	If everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary	16
15328	3802	Many people find inspiration from books and movies so if these were limited to only particular subjects people would begin to feel pressured to be the same	17
15329	3802	Every person should have a right to enjoy the things that make them happy without being hurt by the opinions and judgements of others	18
15330	3802	Books should be something that each person should have a choice in	19
15331	3802	If there are endless choices of books and movies a person could learn about many different things and develope a more open mind	20
15332	3802	If everyone in this world opened their mind people would become more accepting of others	21
15333	3802	So I believe anything that is published should be there for the public to read	22
15334	3802	No one should be limited because of other people's values or interest	23
15335	3802	The right to read the books, magazines, and watch the movies you like should always be present.	24
15336	3803	Should we remove books and media because they are offensive	0
15337	3803	I do not believe so	1
15338	3803	In this essay I will describe to you why I think this way	2
15339	3803	The word offensive is a contreversial word	3
15340	3803	Is it kissing that makes books and media offensive or is it curse words or fighting	4
15341	3803	Many people see many different things	5
15342	3803	Many off the books today's youth read are 'offensive' to older generations	6
15343	3803	That is because today's standerds are different	7
15344	3803	Children are more free to do what they want and say what they want, making offensive a changed word	8
15345	3803	If a book, song, or video is offensive then the parents should take that up with their children	9
15346	3803	Things that are offensive for some people are just fine for other people	10
15347	3803	Just because it is out there does not mean that we have to see it	11
15348	3803	So in conclusion I do not think that books and media should be removed from the shelf for being offensive, because offensive is a changing word and it is different for every person.	12
15349	3804	In my personal opinion, I do believe that certain materials whether it be in books, music, magazines, or movies be romoved or edited more carefully	0
15350	3804	Most parents, including mine, expect their kids to behave with manners and not use foul language or make out with their boyfriend or girlfriend in inappropriate times, and yet we promote it and that's unacceptable	1
15351	3804	In bookstores or even libraries, they have some books on the shelves that can be considered inappropriate	2
15352	3804	We encourage and even push kids to read, but we can't even say, pick any book you want	3
15353	3804	These books @MONTH1 have foul language, gang violence, or even sexual jestures that I wouldn't even consider giving to a niece or a baby cousin	4
15354	3804	There are many types of music out in the real world	5
15355	3804	Everyone has their favorite music and they have their least favorite	6
15356	3804	In my opinion, you can't make everyone happy so your just going to have to ignore it	7
15357	3804	There are different cd's, cassate tapes, or even records, that you can buy	8
15358	3804	Yes, I think what some people put in their music is not appropriate but we can always change the station on the radio	9
15359	3804	You don't have to purchase that cd, and you can always ride with no music on	10
15360	3804	Magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes	11
15361	3804	Whether it's @PERSON1 on the front page with no hair, or @LOCATION1's next top model	12
15362	3804	Quite frankly, I don't mind seeing that in magazines but strict parents @MONTH1 not want their kids being exposed to @NUM1 actions	13
15363	3804	Magazines could talk about anything such as someone on drugs, alcohol, or winning the lottory	14
15364	3804	You just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely	15
15365	3804	People can get pretty crazy on what they do and how they do it	16
15366	3804	Whether it be in writing, singing, or pictures, you know there is always someone going to do something inappropriate	17
15367	3804	This is reality and there is nothing that we can do about it	18
15368	3804	If you don't want to hear it, don't listen	19
15369	3804	If you dont want to see it, don't buy it	20
15370	3804	Its quite simple	21
15371	3805	Censorship in libraries!Do you believe that certianmaterials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?NO!, I do not think they should be removed	0
15372	3805	I believe everyone is intitled to there own opinion, @CAPS1 if something is offensiv eto one person @CAPS2 @MONTH1 not be to another	1
15373	3805	No one thinks the same or has the same opinion about somethings thats why there is a variety of books, music, movies etc	2
15374	3805	If you take out the 'offensive' things, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 cause offense to another.People just need to stop being sefish and understand everyone is different and we all have different interests	3
15375	3806	Many people, after reading a book, listening to a song, watching a movie or reading a magazine have found themselves upset or disturbed by that peice of media and feel that it should be removed from the shelf they found it on	0
15376	3806	I feel that since everyone has their own definition of offensive and disturbing, that libraries and media centers should separate such materials from other books, magazines or @CAPS1	1
15377	3806	My opinion is that not everyone will find the same things disturbing or offensive	2
15378	3806	It depends on that person's background, religion and personal beliefs	3
15379	3806	I do not that think books, magazines or @CAPS1 shoulds have to be banned from library shelves just because that particular person finds that peice of material offensive	4
15380	3806	If they find it so disturbing then they should discontinue reading that book or magazine, or listening to that @CAPS3	5
15381	3806	One person should not be able to make the choice of keeping a certain book or magazine on the shelf because somewhere out there, I'm sure there is someone who does not find it offensive	6
15382	3806	The partial point of writing a book or song is to express one's opinion of a topic and if the reader or listener does not approve of their opinion, then they should respect that director or author's thoughts and move on	7
15383	3806	If a library or media center contains inapropriate books, magazines or moviees, they should create special areas or shelves to keep such material	8
15384	3806	This area could be created for adult or mature readers, viewers or listeners	9
15385	3806	I also think that books and other peices of media of such inapropriateness should have a label regarding its offensive or explicit content	10
15386	3806	If someone finds a song, book, or magazine article offensive or disturbing	11
15387	3806	I do not think that a single person has the right to have it removed from the public and that there are other ways to keep such material out of a reader or listener's hand, that @MONTH1 not know about its possible offensiveness	12
15388	3806	If warning signs are shown, then the reader or listener should realize that they are taking the risk of being offended or disturbed	13
15389	3806	If such measures are taken, I think they will keep all readers, viewers and listeners pleased.	14
15390	3807	Every person is different, and in being different, people have many varying veiws as to what is or is not acceptable or offensive	0
15391	3807	Something that is very offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else, it is all a matter of values and beliefs	1
15392	3807	Libraries contain a variety of books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials on a variety of topics, some of which @MONTH1 not be appropriate for everyone	2
15393	3807	I do not believe that a material should be removed from shelves just because one person or a group of people find it offensive	3
15394	3807	The offended group is not being forced to read that book or magazine, listen to that music, or watch that movie	4
15395	3807	Materials are placed in a library for the public to enjoy, not just to please certain people	5
15396	3807	I do beleive, however, that materials should be clearly sorted in a library	6
15397	3807	If they are clearly sorted, people are less likley to take something that offends them by accident, and can completely avoid books, movies, magazines, and music that they do not to read, watch, or listen to	7
15398	3807	This can also help keep children away from unwated material	8
15399	3807	To conclude, materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	9
15400	3807	What is offensive to one person, another person might enjoy watching, listening to, or reading	10
15401	3807	It is impossible to please everyone, because every person has different veiws, but a situation can be avoided by careful organization	11
15402	3807	If everything that was found offensive to certain people was taken off of library shelves, there would be nothing left	12
15403	3808	I do not believe that books that are considered offensive should be removed from public libraries	0
15404	3808	I could understand if it was school libraries that were in question, because of the fact that some of the materials that these extremely explicit books contain is not for a child to be reading	1
15405	3808	I feel as if these certain materials can be helpful to seeeing other peoples point of views on certain subjects	2
15406	3808	Though books this material can be called offensive, to certain people this is there culture and how they live	3
15407	3808	What would happen if every book that was considered offinsive was actually removed for book shelves	4
15408	3808	Some of the most interesting books that I have ever picked up have been controversial	5
15409	3808	The eye-opening world of these books is amazing	6
15410	3808	The fact that I can read about other peoples life, and their everyday struggle is astounding to me	7
15411	3808	If we all made a huge decision based off of one persons opinion, then our world would be a mess	8
15412	3808	Therefore, if all of these 'offensive' books were to be removed, then what is left to read	9
15413	3808	I want to read something that is going to grab my attention, and make me want to keep reading	10
15414	3808	I do not think that i would have that type of experience if these books were removed.	11
15415	3809	I believe that censorship is rarely acceptable, and certainly not in libraries, at school or otherwise	0
15416	3809	Censorship prevents knowledge from being obtained, spreading ignorance and intollerance	1
15417	3809	Libraries and schools are meant to be places that encourage free thinking, discovery, and learning	2
15418	3809	Censorship stops these things from occuring	3
15419	3809	If people are prevented from reading what they want, then many will not read, period	4
15420	3809	Not all children and teens are drawn to reading	5
15421	3809	If there is a book that a reluctent reader shows interest in, then why would someone want to take it away	6
15422	3809	Because @CAPS11 or she finds it offensive	7
15423	3809	Because @CAPS11 or she does not agree with the views expressed	8
15424	3809	Neither are legitimate reasons for censorship	9
15425	3809	Most justifications for censorship would not stand the test of time	10
15426	3809	A great number of books challenged in the past are today considered classics and/or important works, such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @PERSON3	11
15427	3809	To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were censored because of the racist language	12
15428	3809	@CAPS12 language helps to set the time period in the novels	13
15429	3809	Also, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS9 is about a lawyer who defends a wrongly accused black man in @LOCATION1	14
15430	3809	The main antagonist is an ignorant, rascist man	15
15431	3809	The book itself is not racist, only the villian of the story	16
15432	3809	Censorship for such reasons is different than not allowing a young child to watch something violent	17
15433	3809	Preventing a child from seeing a rated @CAPS10 movie or reading a letter to @ORGANIZATION3 is a separate issue from censorship	18
15434	3809	I define censorship as preventing someone from seeing or reading something due to personal views rather than for the good of the sheltered person	19
15435	3809	Keep children sheltered when they are young, if one must, but as they grow older and mature, it is essential that they are allowed to mature in their reading, as well	20
15436	3809	If someone lives their life reading only the books others choose for him or her and seeing only the movies and shows chosen for him or her, then @CAPS11 or she will not be his or her own person	21
15437	3809	Living a sheltered life can catch up to people when they reach adulthood	22
15438	3809	They will not have their own views, and will be largely ignorant to the world around them	23
15439	3809	@PERSON2 said, '@CAPS11 who destroys a good book, kills reason itself.' @CAPS12 is what happens to people who have grown up among censorship	24
15440	3809	they have very little reason	25
15441	3809	Censorship can mold people, not for the better	26
15442	3809	People who grow up free to read and watch generally what they wish can turn out differently	27
15443	3809	These people can have views and values of their own, formed by, among other factors, influential books they have read throughout their life	28
15444	3809	Many of these people better understand others, promoting tolerance	29
15445	3809	Censorship takes away all of those wonderful qualities from people	30
15446	3809	Anyone is capable of possessing them	31
15447	3809	Censorship cannot be seen as the norm	32
15448	3809	Libraries and schools should allow children and teenagers to learn and grow.That is the purpose of the institution of education	33
15449	3809	Therfore, censorship should not even be considered	34
15450	3809	Students' freedom to read what they desire should be the policy of all schools and libraries	35
15451	3810	I think that libraries should not remove material such as book, music, movies, magazines	0
15452	3810	I think that libraries should keep them because thier are alot of people tht has thier own stlye at reading	1
15453	3810	Sometimes i will go to the librarie and get a book, then i will go look at magazines, movies, music	2
15454	3810	Thier are alot of movies out right now, and now u can go cheak them out	3
15455	3810	Music is the same way	4
15456	3810	I feel like if thier stuff in the librarie that kids like they should go for it	5
15457	3810	Im sure that they have edgucational books, movies and magazines	6
15458	3810	If  people take out stuff that kids and teens like	7
15459	3810	Some of them might not return back.Thier are alot of students that listen to music and watch movies too	8
15460	3810	I love cheaking out movies from the libraries its easy and they always have the movies that u are lookin for	9
15461	3810	The movies are easy to find	10
15462	3810	and its quick	11
15463	3810	If the music has some offfensive stuff in it that they should take it off the shelves because it will have peopel thinkin why would they put a movie, music, magazines and book up on the shelves if they know it is offensive to the public	12
15464	3810	Inconclusion i hope the people at the libraries take the offensive stuff off the shelves.It would bring move people in and they would have more respect for thoes people	13
15465	3810	The public would`t have to worrie about picking up a book that has alot of stuff that thier kids do not need to see, read, or listen	14
15466	3810	That goes for movies, music, magazines, books and more	15
15467	3810	I really hope the people make the right choice	16
15468	3811	Nearly every person has seen, heard, wrote, or said something that offended someone	0
15469	3811	Most of the people that offened others do it on perpose in there music, books, or movies	1
15470	3811	While some other people accdeltly offened people by the way the worded somedthing	2
15471	3811	If someone finds something offensive, they should ask for it to be placed somewhere else so it is still avaible, ask for a vote to remove it from the shelves, or just keep it to themselves until they know their not to only one offeneded	3
15472	3811	When someone gets offened by something they see and hear in a library, that person should ask for relocation for the offensive meteral they seen or heared	4
15473	3811	In this case, other people can still watch, hear, or read the book or magazine, movie, or music	5
15474	3811	Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it is to someone else	6
15475	3811	A book or magazine, song, or movie could be offensive to a lot of people, so it should be voted to be removed or stay in the labrary	7
15476	3811	This way the materal has a chance to be avaible in the future	8
15477	3811	Some music and movies could get removed then replaced with the censered version so it for the people that were not offened	9
15478	3811	In some cases there is only one person that got offeneded by something that was in a library	10
15479	3811	In these cases the person could chose to wait to until someone else is offeneded by the materal to speek up about it's offensiveness	11
15480	3811	If materal is offensive to someone they should get it relocated, voted on, or hold their peace	12
15481	3811	If relocated the materal is still avaible to other people	13
15482	3811	When voted one it could stay or be removed	14
15483	3811	Someone can speek up about the offensive materal after someone else find it offensive as well.	15
15484	3812	If I think that something is offensive then yes, it should be removed from the bookshelves	0
15485	3812	The library is a place for everyone and not just one type of people	1
15486	3812	If something offended you then u wouldnt want someone else of the same race, religion, or family to read it and be offended	2
15487	3812	Yes, we have freedom of speech and can say anything we want, but i think it should only go so far and then should be stopped	3
15488	3812	Someone can only take so much and then when they reach that point nothing turns out any good	4
15489	3812	If somebody were to write about the blacks and saying they are all dumb just because they are black, then the blacks would notjust stand around and do nothing	5
15490	3812	After u call someone names or pick one them so much it scars them for life and it could hurt their whole communication skills for the rest of their life	6
15491	3812	Not everyone but some even take it so far as hurting themself or others	7
15492	3812	So if i seen a book on the bookshelves of the public library that offended me then yes, i would want it to be removed so it doesnt offend anybody else	8
15493	3812	I dont think that hurting someones feelings is worth messing up their whole life or causing them to hurt themself	9
15494	3812	If something hurt u or offended u would u just let it happen or would u use the rights that we are given and try to make it right and not hurt anyone else	10
15495	3812	Would you want somneone writing about u in a mean way	11
15496	3812	You would probly try to make it right	12
15497	3812	If you could fix something and didnt just because you didnt feel like it and it continued to offendother people then not only is it the persons fault that wrote it but i could see it kinda being your fault for letting that person still burt people.	13
15498	3815	In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines and much much more	0
15499	3815	Some of these items though are seen as inappropiate for certain ages	1
15500	3815	I believe though that every customer in the library should have the ability to choose what they want to read	2
15501	3815	It is up to the parents or the child to decide what they want in their heads	3
15502	3815	Let us start with books	4
15503	3815	There are many different types of books	5
15504	3815	From scientific data about human anatomy to dragons and vampires	6
15505	3815	How can you choose a book that is deemed appropiate for you though	7
15506	3815	The answer is simple	8
15507	3815	When you are younger, your parents help you choose the right books to read and as you mature, you begin to make thoses choices yourself	9
15508	3815	It is up to you whether or not you should read a certain book	10
15509	3815	Movies guidelines are along the same pattern	11
15510	3815	Your parents helped you choose appropiate movies in your youth	12
15511	3815	When you grow up, you learn to read about the movie, and look at the rating	13
15512	3815	If it seems to intimadating, or innapropiate, or violent, you make the choice to see it or not	14
15513	3815	Sometimes you see offensive material in movies or books	15
15514	3815	If you dissaprove of it strongly take the dilemma to the librarian	16
15515	3815	Discuss why you think the movie/book is unnappropiate and offer some ideas on how to deals with the situation	17
15516	3815	Some suggestions could be: to remove the item from the shelf, or to write and extra review on the book, or write to the author/movie director	18
15517	3815	The simplest solution though is to just leave the offensive item alone	19
15518	3815	If it offends you, just send it back to the library and warn your friends not to check it out	20
15519	3815	Others @MONTH1 still enjoy the item even though you don't	21
15520	3815	There are many books, movies, magazines, etc	22
15521	3815	out in the world	23
15522	3815	Some @MONTH1 be deemed as innapropiate or offensive	24
15523	3815	There are many other choices that are 'okay'	25
15524	3815	So if you don't approve of a certain book, just send it back to the library and find one you do like.	26
15525	3816	Should books, music, movies, and magazines be removed if found offensive	0
15526	3816	Well i think that they they should be put to a vot for everyone, who goes to that library, to decide	1
15527	3816	That some might not find it offensieve as others do	2
15528	3816	No because people have different beleafs than others	3
15529	3816	I think they should be put to a vote for everyone, who goes to that library, to decide because the staff might think its morally incorrect and morally offensive	4
15530	3816	But others like the people checking out the books might think differently then the staff	5
15531	3816	The staff is not the one who reads all the books their customers do	6
15532	3816	Some might not find it offensive as other do because every one person thinks differently	7
15533	3816	No one person thinks the same reson unless they have been told what another person thinks	8
15534	3816	the library might loss its people if they take a book out for the wrong reason	9
15535	3816	Weather they like it or not all books teach a lesson about life	10
15536	3816	No because people have different beleafs then others	11
15537	3816	In one culter that book might be aloud and they might live around that library	12
15538	3816	So that would make then miss out on going to the library for books	13
15539	3816	For example, if the library choose to take out the bible and romance novels then they would loss a lot of customers	14
15540	3816	Their business would fall	15
15541	3816	The library staff should not be aloud to choose what books are aloud because if some one has a fine they get money	16
15542	3816	So my answer is no because they shuld put it to a vote, some might not find it as offensive as others do, and people have different beleafs than others do	17
15543	3816	No one person has the same thought that the next person does it is impossible	18
15544	3818	I do not believe that any material should be removed from library shelves	0
15545	3818	I stand frmly with this because it is a choice to read material that is found offensive	1
15546	3818	I would not expect a young child to seek out inappropiate materials because they are not interested in them	2
15547	3818	Just as I would not expect an adult to go searching for a little kid book	3
15548	3818	Basically there is a maturity barrier that seperates what each age level is interested in reading	4
15549	3818	There is no point in removing any material from libraries because you would accomplish nothing	5
15550	3818	People who would get offended mainly children are already exposed to violent videogames which glorify war and violence	6
15551	3818	And you can not just go ahead and remove material that you think is offensive	7
15552	3818	If you removed offensive material from libraries then I guess you would have to shut down the internet as well	8
15553	3818	A child could much more easily go to a computer and find anything offensive they want to find with the click of a button	9
15554	3818	Also at a library their are age level restrictions on cards that prevent a child from checking out offensive material	10
15555	3818	Some people might enjoy material that is offensive	11
15556	3818	If material is removed  alot of people would be upset that libraries do not carry what they wanted	12
15557	3818	There would be alot of complaints, and problems	13
15558	3818	And some people might stop going to the library because the content was limited.	14
15559	3818	The best thing to do is allow libraries to have whatever material they want to have	15
15560	3818	Many people will be satasified, and most people will be happy	16
15561	3819	The author Katherine Paterson makes a very good point when she states that there are books on the shelf that poeple wish that there kids or even there on self did not read or that people wish they did not read	0
15562	3819	But if your were to take away ever book someone found offensive there would be hardly any books left in this world	1
15563	3819	There will always be one person that finds a book that they do not like because of tone the author uses or if they do not like what they call eachother	2
15564	3819	People all have there own mind sit to away that they want to live or how they want there kids to live	3
15565	3819	Having books taken off the shelf because people do not like them would result in having no more books on our shelves	4
15566	3819	I feel like if there books on the shelves about kids drinking then have bad effects on there life cause they did drink then maybe the kid reading it would stop drinking or not even try drinking	5
15567	3819	The books about getting raped and them not telling becasue they are afriad of what would happening	6
15568	3819	Then in the long run telling after they get pregant or injured from it	7
15569	3819	Them saying that they wish they would have told might help the kids that this happened to or this might happen to might help them feel so relief and tell someone and save themself	8
15570	3819	Books like these should not get taken off the shelf because one person does not like it, in the long run if they did take it off some could get hurt or not know what to do and it couls be all that one person that did not like it fault	9
15571	3819	How would you feel if you did that to someone	10
15572	3819	Maryrin @CAPS1 is a good Author that shows how something that you @MONTH1 think is good but truns out to be really bad	11
15573	3819	Her books focus a lot on how girls need to watch what they are doing to keep themselves safe	12
15574	3819	I have a friend that have parents that do not like the music on her ipod	13
15575	3819	So she had to take it off	14
15576	3819	Well with taking it off she made @CAPS2 of the songs that they did not like	15
15577	3819	She drives so they music is always playing on the radio while she drives so she can listen to the songs that she does not have on her ipod	16
15578	3819	That is just one example of how you will always get around listening to what you want to hear	17
15579	3819	Music will always be out there	18
15580	3819	There will always be songs that poeple do not like	19
15581	3819	Either due to there religion or even if they do not like the words used	20
15582	3819	But even if they stop putting songs on the radio there is still internet out there and people can just get there songs from there	21
15583	3819	There are songs out there that should not be out there but the more someone tries to push the songs out of the world and out of people listening to them the more some kids or even adults are going to try to listen to them	22
15584	3819	In the world today there are always a good and a bad song that is the same	23
15585	3819	Artics now always have a bad song that they would have to make into a good song	24
15586	3819	That is just how the songs go	25
15587	3819	That is just how they use there brains	26
15588	3819	No one can stop them	27
15589	3819	Not even the people that publish the songs and put then on the radio	28
15590	3819	In the long run of things the more people try to stop things from not being in this world the more people are going to try to get them	29
15591	3819	It is a very bad idea to take the books off of shelves and take music off of the radio	30
15592	3819	People need to hear what bad things can happen when you do not listen to someone	31
15593	3819	A kid @MONTH1 grow up knowing not to talk to people they do not know but never really understand what bad could come out of it	32
15594	3819	But when they read a book about a kid there age getting kidnapped they @MONTH1 understand more clearly on the whys in life	33
15595	3819	So if I can say so myself I think that it is a very bad idea for books to be taken off the shelf because one mother or two dads think that book is not good for thier little girl or there teenage son	34
15596	3819	They need to read it for themself and find out what really could happen if they did something like that	35
15597	3819	Keep the books on the self	36
15598	3819	Keep playing the some music	37
15599	3819	Let your kids or grandchildren find out the danger on there own rather then you just keep telling them	38
15600	3819	I am a teenage girl and I would rather read about it then having my parents tell me over and over agian	39
15601	3819	So keep the books on the shelves	40
15602	3819	That the radio play	41
15603	3819	Just be safe in doing it.	42
15604	3820	Should books, magazines, music, and movies be removed from shelves, if found offensive	0
15605	3820	I think the answer is yes, as long as it offends more than a few people	1
15606	3820	If it only offends a few people, then I think the answer should be no	2
15607	3820	Why should they be removed if they offend a lot of people	3
15608	3820	They should be removed because offensive things can lead to more dramatic things	4
15609	3820	It's almost like when people were segragted by race	5
15610	3820	The segragation led to fights between the people	6
15611	3820	How would you feel if segragation was still around	7
15612	3820	You might be upset and find it unfair, because you cannot do some things	8
15613	3820	That is probabally how some people feel when they get offended by the media	9
15614	3820	Why shouldn't they be removed for offending a few people	10
15615	3820	They shouldn't be removed because they might be able to help younger generations decide what is right and wrong	11
15616	3820	They could help by giving the people choices of what is right and what is wrong	12
15617	3820	If there was nothing out there that offended anyone, how would younger generations learn how to decided what is right and wrong	13
15618	3820	In my opinion, it all depends on how many people are offended by it	14
15619	3820	There are ups and downs either way it goes	15
15620	3820	If you removed everything that offended anyone, it would be harder to teach younger generations to decided what is right and wrong by themselves	16
15621	3820	This would mainly be because you would only have one point of view, the point of view that is perfect for everybody	17
15622	3820	The way I see it, that point of view does not exsist	18
15623	3820	Therefore, I believe by removing everything that is offensive to anyone, we would not have a media	19
15624	3820	However, if we did not remove anything that was offensive, serious issues could occur	20
15625	3820	For example, fights could break out or wars could even start, depending on how many people were offended	21
15626	3820	The last thing we need in our society is fighting	22
15627	3820	So my answer for removing offensive things would have to be yes and no.	23
15628	3821	Everybody is in tittle of making their own desicion	0
15629	3821	If that includes not letting their own children look at certain books then that's okay, but that doesn't mean they have to make that desicion for everyone	1
15630	3821	Everyone has their own opinion of certain books that might be less modest than others that just how it is, but to take the book out of the libraries is not taking in consideration of others	2
15631	3821	If there are some books that are offense to a certain type of ethnicty or religion ect	3
15632	3821	then just ignore it and go on	4
15633	3821	There is no reason to take those kinds of books out, for what we all know that certain book might be used for research and that person that needs	5
15634	3821	Taking out certain books of the library are depriving the youth from contemporary literature that is going to be very imporant for the future	6
15635	3821	The @CAPS1 is a good example, in the time it got published many people wanted to get rid of the book because it was not traditional, that book is now being used in our class room and is teaching us many literary techniques	7
15636	3821	There are countless books just like The @CAPS1 that are being taked out of libraries now and that could be deeply appreciated by the future writers	8
15637	3821	Katherine Paterson has the prospective of many authors, taking out books that are offensive to people is going to cause us to have no books	9
15638	3821	For hard working writers it is unfair to work so hard and have the book band from the libraries because a certain group of parents didn't find it approving	10
15639	3821	If they don't approve of the book then tell the child not to get it	11
15640	3821	A library is a place to enjoy the countless amount of literature of many different styles and should not be restricted	12
15641	3821	The library is a place of discovery not a place of restriction.	13
15642	3822	Libraries are often known for protecting our children and keeping an education atmosphere, however, you would be suprised the content our children @MONTH1 find in such a seemingly friendly place	0
15643	3822	With a simple library card, children could check out a   boat-load of information that could be teaching them lessons you would not want them to learn	1
15644	3822	But nobody can be looking over thier child's shoulders all the time	2
15645	3822	The answer to this problem is strict censorship	3
15646	3822	Books are big, powerful, and a vast amount of information	4
15647	3822	Even though most parents believe publishing companies would intend on not letting children reading books that can be easily misunderstood, the truth is it's up to the library wether or not a book can be checked out	5
15648	3822	Most of the time, only adults can understand what the charaters in a book are going through	6
15649	3822	This @MONTH1 be because of the adult's extensively more experiences throughout their own life	7
15650	3822	Another comon belief is that seperating a library for the younger and older would solve this problem	8
15651	3822	The fact is, even if an adult checks a type of media from the older selection, this does not stop the younger child from witnessing or reading something as simple as a video or magazine at home	9
15652	3822	The only solution is to stop these materials from entering libraries and censoring the offensive, easily misunderstood media before it gets into the wrong hands	10
15653	3822	Libraries are great for research or school projects, but books and magazines that are inapropriate should never end up in the place built for an education experience for your kids	11
15654	3822	Censorship has to be inforced to help keep and maintain our libraries educational atmospher and keeping our children safe from offensive material	12
15655	3823	I don't think that certain materials should be removed if they're found offensive to people	0
15656	3823	If someone reads something and it offends them, they can go do something else	1
15657	3823	I'm not the type of person to get offended too easily, So I don't know how well my opinion fits	2
15658	3823	Everyone gets offended over something, so I can see why people find somethings offensive	3
15659	3823	But in all honesty, if someone read something and thought that it was offensive, they have the option to either say why they thought it was offensive, or they could just ignore it	4
15660	3823	In libraries, I think that if the @CAPS1 finds a story offensive, it should be okay for them to take it off the shelves, They work there after all	5
15661	3823	If it were me though, I'd just let it go, and if someone asks me to remove it, I might do it	6
15662	3823	Alot of people now-a-days, seem to take offense over everything	7
15663	3823	But a material should not be removed from a library shelve, unless the @CAPS1, or the manager, find it offensive, then I can understand their decision.	8
15664	3824	Censorship on Libraries	0
15665	3824	Do you ever walk into a library, walk up to one of those gigantic, cluttered book shelves and pick up a book that looks promising, and worth reading	1
15666	3824	Well, what happens if you go to read the summary of this unfathomably great book, and you just feel...alienated, by the style that this book is written	2
15667	3824	Do you ever want to take that book off the shelf	3
15668	3824	Well, I do	4
15669	3824	But,  if everyone takes a book off of a shelf that they are  uncomfortable with, there would be a miniscule amount, if any books to read at all	5
15670	3824	Books based on @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and even @CAPS3 can be a nuisence, because it segregates people	6
15671	3824	When you go to the various sections of your local library, what section do you start sprinting towards	7
15672	3824	The adult section has tons of different genres of books, but what do you do when you find one about @CAPS4	8
15673	3824	If you are a person of a certain faith, and you find a book that is making fun of your faith what do you do then	9
15674	3824	Nothing, because there is freedom of speech	10
15675	3824	You @MONTH1 be uncomfortable about that book being sold in countries all over the world, but what if someone feels that same way about your favorite book	11
15676	3824	This is a topic people have been 'debating' for years	12
15677	3824	Suppose you glide on over to an alienated shelf	13
15678	3824	This very colorful book is just screaming for your attention	14
15679	3824	You pick up the book and come to find, it is talking about @CAPS2	15
15680	3824	That could make anyone feel uncomfortable	16
15681	3824	I personally do not agree with making fun of poeple in this way	17
15682	3824	Poeple are made to look different for a purpose, not to humiliate them but so not all of us look the same, and we can be our own person	18
15683	3824	What would you do if you picked up a book, where someone is being teased about their looks, and @CAPS3	19
15684	3824	Sure one joke can make everyone love you, but when one person is not very fond of you, well that speaks a thousand words	20
15685	3824	Different genres of characteristics include	21
15686	3824	being bigger or smaller, taller or shorter, having brown, blonde or red hair	22
15687	3824	Millions of people are critised and teased relentlessly becuase they look just a little bit different	23
15688	3824	Everyone has been teased once in their life	24
15689	3824	It is not very funny to the person being teased	25
15690	3824	Books based on @CAPS4, @CAPS2 and even @CAPS3 can be a nuisence, because it segregates people	26
15691	3824	I have written you this letter to tell you that I do not support some of the books on the market or the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11, but if everyone felt this way there would be no books	27
15692	3824	So I do not think we should take the books off of the shelves	28
15693	3824	We just need to embrace the fact that everyone is different, and that is not a joke	29
15694	3824	Where would the world be today, if we believed the same way we did years ago about these very topics	30
15695	3824	Do not take the books off the shelf, maybe one day it will signify what the world used to be	31
15696	3825	It has been brought to my attention by some members of my community that the local library is planning to remove some materials such as our books, movies, and music	0
15697	3825	I've confronted them and they've made no such such effort as to amend the censorship that has already taken place	1
15698	3825	I understand that some works @MONTH1 be found offensive to some audiences, but I believe all people should have access to the knowedge they wish to acquire	2
15699	3825	These works they wish to condemn and banish are works of passion and labor	3
15700	3825	What I've noticed is, the materials they view as compremising are some of the most passionate, heartfelt labors of expression	4
15701	3825	and I firmly believe this removal act hurts more than those that are banished	5
15702	3825	This denies those artists of their own freedom of expression and represses something simple, our own expression	6
15703	3825	The capibilities of the human mind are limitless, but yet those who display it's functions are limited	7
15704	3825	Knowledge is the key to unlocking a much more vast understanding of the world around us and I believe this censorship highlights what I attempt to depict in my own exposition of our minds	8
15705	3825	I believe we have come very far in the evolution of our liturature and I would hate to see the flame of inspiration for creation snuffed out in a modest dash	9
15706	3825	Just out of a few broken heartstrings	10
15707	3825	Or a spare tear lost upon the earth, dusted by some ignorance forsaken, missunderstood language doomed to be lost	11
15708	3825	out of a loss of understanding	12
15709	3825	I think not	13
15710	3825	In conclusion, I've noted what I wish to converse and I firmly stand against this censorship	14
15711	3825	I'm only one voice, but this is a call to arms and I believe we can accomplish great things together	15
15712	3825	So let's get the word out and defeat this repression of expression	16
15713	3826	Knowledge @CAPS1     @CAPS2 you ever remove something that be misconstrued as offensive to someone, although you don't believe it is	0
15714	3826	Neither @CAPS2 I, and I dont believe libraries should either	1
15715	3826	Removing books, movies, magazines, and music from libraries is unconstitutional, and it seems to lean toward controling how people think, known as communism	2
15716	3826	Also anything can be found offensive by one party of people, and so everything @CAPS2 be offensive, and removed	3
15717	3826	Then libraries @CAPS2 cease to exist	4
15718	3826	What about in the court room	5
15719	3826	If one side of the story is not told, how will the jury be able to tell if the accused is guilty or innocent	6
15720	3826	Taking out certain 'offensive' learning materials @CAPS2 leave people in a bored mindless state of mind	7
15721	3826	Do you want the government controling what you think	8
15722	3826	I didn't think so	9
15723	3826	In the @LOCATION1, modern day @LOCATION2, @PERSON1 did just that	10
15724	3826	He decided exactaly what went in and out of peoples minds	11
15725	3826	He did this by desiding what they could read, write, and listen to	12
15726	3826	That sounds like things you can get at the library, right	13
15727	3826	We can't have the government controling what we think, and mostly all libraries are government run	14
15728	3826	If we let them deside what we read and listen to, thats the first step in losing our freedom, and nobody wants to lose their freedom	15
15729	3826	Lets say a white man goes into a library and looks at a book about racism, and how it has helped the nation	16
15730	3826	Then, at the same time, an @CAPS3 @CAPS4 women goes into the same library and gets a book on why women are better than men	17
15731	3826	Then they see each other, and the woman wants the mans book banned, and the man wants the womans book banned, and both the books are removed	18
15732	3826	Then neither party is happy, because both of their books are gone	19
15733	3826	The point is, anything can be found offensive, if you just glance at it, or look at it to much	20
15734	3826	Plus if everything can be found offensive, and all of the offencive materials get removed, then all the books and learning materials are gone	21
15735	3826	Noone is left happy	22
15736	3826	If you are being tried for murdering someone, and the lawyer of the defendent gets to say their piece to makes it look like you are a murderer, and you don't get to defend yourself, what are you going to do	23
15737	3826	Your going to go to jail, most likly an innocent person, and your marked as a murderer the rest of your life, all because your side of the story wasn't heard	24
15738	3826	That is unjust, unfair, and unconstitutional	25
15739	3826	If we let this happen to our libraries, half the books will be sentinced to 'death,' without a 'fair trial.'     So, if you want to have an un-@CAPS4, communist, and unfair library system, that is your choice, but I believe that the way we do things now is just fine	26
15740	3826	No book should be banned because of its material, because noone, except the writer knows exactally what it means	27
15741	3826	People get to read what they want to read, and don't have to read what they don't want to read	28
15742	3826	Thats what the freedom we have is, you have a right to read, watch, and listen to whatever you want, and nobody can stop you	29
15743	3826	Do you want that to change	30
15744	3826	I know your awnser	31
15745	3826	it's a no	32
15746	3827	A library is a place to rent books, music, movies, etc., that you don't have at your home	0
15747	3827	Some people go to a library to use the computer for a project, or to check out books, musical materials, movies, etc	1
15748	3827	@CAPS1 isn't a bad thing if the library has materials that are offensive to some people	2
15749	3827	If people don't want to see material that will offend them then they shouldn't go to the are in the library that contains the offensive materials	3
15750	3827	In my own personal opinion, @CAPS1 doesn't really apply to me if there is offensive material in the library	4
15751	3827	If there is going to be offensive material in a library then you should be a certain age to rent @CAPS1 or read @CAPS1	5
15752	3827	Not just anyone should be able to walk into the library and check out these offensive materials	6
15753	3827	If someone that is under this age tries to check out this material, then they shouldn't be aloud to have them	7
15754	3827	Another opinion of mine on this subject, is if these kinds of material offend someone then they could not go to that area of the library	8
15755	3827	Instead the person can go around this section of the library or they could not pay attention to the materials	9
15756	3827	The library could make a certain part of the library made just for these kinds of material, so that people nor children have to see them	10
15757	3827	Also, if a child wants to see these kinds of materials then they could find another way to see them	11
15758	3827	They don't necessarily have to go to the library to find these kinds of things	12
15759	3827	If a child wants to do something badly enough then they will find a way to do @CAPS1, or in this case the child will see something that they want to see	13
15760	3827	If parents don't like these kinds of materials in the library then they should teach their children not to look at these kinds of materials, if they catch their children looking at materials that are offensive then they should punish their child and let them know that they shouldn't look at those kinds of materials	14
15761	3827	A library shouldn't have to take off their books, music, magazines, etc., just to satify parents	15
15762	3827	If the library took these kinds of materials off of their shelves then they would lose business	16
15763	3827	So in theory, libraries should not have to take their materials off of their shelves just to satisfy parents	17
15764	3827	Libraries need money so that they can buy new materials and without customers they have no money which enables them unable to buy new materials	18
15765	3827	So parents should keep track of what their kids check out at the library	19
15766	3827	Offensive materials should not be taken out of libraries, these kind of materials should just have rules.	20
15767	3828	To begin with, a woman might read a book about wifes and find it offense	0
15768	3828	But it was her choice to pick up the book and read it	1
15769	3828	Should it be taken off the shelf	2
15770	3828	No why should it	3
15771	3828	Different people have different perpectives on what they're reading	4
15772	3828	Not all people feel the same way	5
15773	3828	Samething goes for music, movies, magazines, etc	6
15774	3828	They might see a naked picture of someone in a magazine and not like it	7
15775	3828	It was there choice to pick it up and read it	8
15776	3828	No one held a gun to there head and said 'read the book etc.'      @CAPS1, why should a book, etc., be taken off the shelf if one person doesn't like it	9
15777	3828	You still have the rest of the population who might love it, some might just like it, and the ones who don't	10
15778	3828	You can't just think about that one person you have to consider everybody esle	11
15779	3828	If that person finds that book, etc., offensive then they should have chosen wisely the first time and/or never should have chose what they did	12
15780	3828	It's there own fault	13
15781	3828	For my conclusion, nothing should be taken off  the shelf if its offensive just don't read the book and etc	14
15782	3828	Another person might read it and like it	15
15783	3828	Some people who finds things offensive are maybe looking at it in the wrong way	16
15784	3828	Keep the book etc., on the shelf if they take it off then sooner or later they will take everything off the shelf for being offensive	17
15785	3828	Then what we will be able to read or listen too	18
15786	3829	There is much censorship that occurs in the world	0
15787	3829	Music on the radio, television shows, or the internet is all censored	1
15788	3829	In todays society the library is a forgotten wonder to most, making it a secluded world	2
15789	3829	The library is a place were one's mind can explore and discover as much as it wants	3
15790	3829	The library should not be a place of restricted discovery, like on the televsion or the internet, censorship in libraries should be non-existant	4
15791	3829	People learn from books	5
15792	3829	books with happy endings, and sad endings, and gruesome endings, are all able to provide lessons for the reader	6
15793	3829	Many say that history repeats itself	7
15794	3829	Therefore history is taught in schools so that the bad events that occurred in history can be prevented	8
15795	3829	This is the same for the books that are on library shelves	9
15796	3829	When reading a book, the reader is able to experience the lifes of the characters as if they are living with the characters	10
15797	3829	Through the experiences of the characters, the reader gets to observe all the things done wrong and right by that character without acually living the experience	11
15798	3829	By the end of the book the reader will have knew views on life, and will try to not make the same mistakes as the characters in the book	12
15799	3829	A major fear among the parents is the inappropriate language or scenes that @MONTH1 be described in books	13
15800	3829	To be blatantly honest, there is foul language and inappopriate doings in this world	14
15801	3829	It is much better to have it discovered gradually through reading and maybe a couple of life experiences, then to have it all thrown in ones face at one moment	15
15802	3829	The censoring that occurs on the radio and television is fine, just when someone wants to improve themselves by reading, they should be able to read whatever they feel	16
15803	3829	A library is a place of wonderous learning, but if there is censorship, it restricts ones learning	17
15804	3829	Through reading one is able to experience life without the consequences of experienceing life	18
15805	3829	All books are able to be learned from, and they should all have the opportunity to be learned from.	19
15806	3830	Have you ever felt as though your reading choices are dwindeling	0
15807	3830	Censorship is taking away our freedom to experince to read or listen to what we want, who has the right to tell us what we can watch, read or even listen to	1
15808	3830	As an avid reader of all kinds of literature i cant stand censorship	2
15809	3830	Kids today need to be able to read what they want, to open up their minds to new ideas and ways of life	3
15810	3830	The so called 'banned' books are some of the best anyone can read, as @CAPS1 we should be able to read what we want, wether it is offensive or not	4
15811	3830	If you want to put certain restictions on a book such as a age limit i can understad that, but to completely take them off the shelves then we are losing our greatest right as an @CAPS2 citisen	5
15812	3830	To read and watch or listen other media is a great way to learn about things other than what is in our back yard	6
15813	3830	Music and television i understand some censorship, i dont want my little brother or any younger youth hearing the '@CAPS3 bomb' or seeing anythin obsene, but these days its getting harder and harder to control what they watch or listen to seeing how it's so easy to obtain those sources of media	7
15814	3830	Many kids today have access to the enternet which can be good and bad	8
15815	3830	If a parent does not want their kids watching or listening to anything obscene then they have the right to but certain blocks on their computer	9
15816	3830	Kisd these days mainly use two kinds of media which are the enternet and @CAPS4, but a kid who wants to read should have as many choices as possible weather it be fiction, classics such as 'The @CAPS5 snd The @CAPS6', or educational litterature	10
15817	3830	So is our reading choices becoming scarese	11
15818	3830	Yes i believe so, na it all has to do with censorship	12
15819	3830	We cant read some of the classics because the're 'racist' or are 'pornagraphic', but you have to understand for the time they were written the weren't	13
15820	3830	so let everyone read what they want when they want.	14
15821	3831	'Do you bleieve that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?'  No, I do not believe just because someone individually finds something offensive means everyone else does	0
15822	3831	Everyone has a different opinion, we're all different	1
15823	3831	We need variety of all books, music, movies, magazines, etc.	2
15824	3831	Censorship is understandable, in some ways	3
15825	3831	Without a variety for all would leave everyone less choice	4
15826	3831	Your opinions, decisions, outlook on life yourself is one of a kind	5
15827	3831	How are you to tell someone they can't listen to a certain song or read a specific book	6
15828	3831	Exactly, that doesn't make sense right	7
15829	3831	If individuals didn't have options of choices there would be no entertainment	8
15830	3831	In my opinion	9
15831	3831	if someone has such a problem with a certain topic, subject, etc	10
15832	3831	then leave it alone	11
15833	3831	It's a big world with more than just you with your opinion	12
15834	3831	Be open minded	13
15835	3831	Someone else is probably writing this essay with the total opposite response to this prompt	14
15836	3831	It just goes to show no ones opinion is right or wrong	15
15837	3831	Individuals should all have individuality	16
15838	3831	Without variety, how is that possible	17
15839	3831	From music, books, magazines, movies, etc.- disagreements are one thing but in questions like this you have to agree to disagree	18
15840	3832	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
15841	3832	But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work i abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
15842	3832	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson said this about the topic of book censory in the library	2
15843	3832	This is a very tricky subject because no one will ever be happy	3
15844	3832	All books, music, movies, magiznes, etc.can be considered offensive to someone	4
15845	3832	When it comes to books in the library we should have sections	5
15846	3832	One for @CAPS3, child, family, activity, romance, etc	6
15847	3832	if we have thoes then it would cut down on what books children can look at	7
15848	3832	One time I went to @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 and I accidently wondered into the @CAPS3 books section	8
15849	3832	I knew that I was not suppost to go into that section, but if they had it marked that it was the @CAPS3 Books section then I would not have gone in there	9
15850	3832	Parents need to moniter what there kids look at, or even what part of the library they go into	10
15851	3832	If a child wonders into the romance section then they are going to see that kind of book it is not the librarys fault or even the fault of the writer	11
15852	3832	If the parent does not want to moniter what the child looks at they could set boundries	12
15853	3832	they could say 'Do not leave this section.'	13
15854	3832	If my mom said that to me i would stay around the child books	14
15855	3832	The parents could moniter the child to solve the problem	15
15856	3832	Library's need to decide what kind of books they are going to have in the library	16
15857	3832	If the library does not have the kind of books you do not want your child to see then your child can not look at that book	17
15858	3832	If your public library does keep thoes books in the open the parents could always go to a town hall and tell the mayor, librarian, or other towns people about the rude books	18
15859	3832	If you tell people the library has that kind of books then others will stand up aginst the books	19
15860	3832	If you do not like what the library has on the shelfs, suggest sections for the books, keep watch of what your kids look at, or tell someone that can do something about the problem	20
15861	3832	What are you going to do to improve you public library	21
15862	3832	how are you going to make you kids not go and look at the books you dont want them to see	22
15863	3833	Censorship in libraries should not be mandated	0
15864	3833	Censorship should not block the the 'allegory' in some books that the author is trying to give a story within a story to the reader	1
15865	3833	Censorship would lead to @ORGANIZATION1 just like in @DATE1'	2
15866	3833	You could not the true meaning of an art piece that the artist is trying to show, so there could be no possible abstract art	3
15867	3833	The word definition of allegory is a story within a story	4
15868	3833	It is where the author is trying to show to the reader	5
15869	3833	For example like in the book '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2' is an allegory	6
15870	3833	It shows many storys tying in with each other	7
15871	3833	When @ORGANIZATION3 dies on the side of the cliff by @CAPS3 when he launches the huge rock over board	8
15872	3833	That shows the fall of man	9
15873	3833	In the @CAPS4 where @CAPS5 eats the apple from the tree and that is why we sin	10
15874	3833	You just cannot censor such a great book	11
15875	3833	Very many people would not like that book because it shows young boys being savages and killing each other	12
15876	3833	Everyone needs to look at both sides of the story	13
15877	3833	People need to know the true meaning of what is being said	14
15878	3833	Art should not be censored at all	15
15879	3833	Art is what makes people creative	16
15880	3833	The way artists make things abstract that could kindle some controversy	17
15881	3833	Also they make things that we use today that we just don't think about, that are utilitarion	18
15882	3833	Who would give you the right to censor thier master pieces	19
15883	3833	For example @ORGANIZATION2 had a dark period in his work and painted demon's in his paintings and people might think that is way too graffic	20
15884	3833	People need to see why he painted such works of what was going on during his life at that time	21
15885	3833	Censorship is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1	22
15886	3833	This would to a book called '@DATE1' by @PERSON1	23
15887	3833	In his book he show complete govnerment @ORGANIZATION1	24
15888	3833	We as the people of our goverment would be classified as the '@CAPS6'	25
15889	3833	The @CAPS6 made the majority of the people and were not very smart people	26
15890	3833	Also could not think for themselves because the @ORGANIZATION1 censored everything you could think of	27
15891	3833	The @ORGANIZATION1 did this because so they would not have anyone try to be a rebel and over throw the @ORGANIZATION1	28
15892	3833	They knew that @CAPS6 could over throw them, but they were on top of their game and censored everying	29
15893	3833	This is what would happen if we censored everything	30
15894	3833	We all would have not personality at all	31
15895	3833	No one could express love the way we do now	32
15896	3833	Censorship would in libraries would not be the most best thing anyone should do	33
15897	3833	No one would know what an author would be leading too, not a single artist could display their art	34
15898	3833	Aslo censorship would lead to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1	35
15899	3833	This could not work in our society today	36
15900	3833	So censorship is not the best idea anyone could think of.	37
15901	3835	I believe that everyone should be free to read, listen or watch what they choose to	0
15902	3835	Anything publically exposed is goin to be seen anyhow	1
15903	3835	I think it shall be up to that person if they want to read something to mature or @ORGANIZATION1 for themself	2
15904	3835	If it is a child i think the parent shall be in charge of that decision not the libarian	3
15905	3835	Books, movies, and music are forms of entertainment	4
15906	3835	People read @ORGANIZATION1 material to entertain themselves, and there is nothing wrong with entertainment	5
15907	3835	Everyone loves entertainment but to put a limit on it is unfair	6
15908	3835	If it is public that mean it should be released under certin circomstances or age, and maturity	7
15909	3835	Regaurdless of in a book or magazine everything that you dont want people to see will always show up somewere else, such as the tv or the internet	8
15910	3835	The public library is were people go to get books to larn more about something so if u yake that book off the shelve someone might miss out on on  education about somthing	9
15911	3835	I wouldn't take any book off the shelf because it was put there to read, and it might be a good thing that child gets that book so that they have knowledge about somethings that are out there	10
15912	3835	If its there to read then let it be read instead of hiding it from them it only makes children more anxious to read or see it	11
15913	3835	If its in a public library let it be read people and children shall be free to anything in the library unless other wise consented by a parent	12
15914	3835	anything publically exposed in a book, magazine or movie will be shown on the internet or tv so children will see what they want  rather elders' agree to it or not	13
15915	3835	Nudity, perfanity, violence, and provocative materialare in everything now days even cartoons so there is no way of kepping it from children or people its apart of everyday livng.	14
15916	3836	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
15917	3836	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
15918	3836	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 many people believe that certain books should be banned from schools, just the opposite is true as students can learn valuable life lessons from these books, get a deeper understanding of the past, and comprehend the true meaning of an author's unique style	2
15919	3836	Over the years many well-written books have been on a 'censored list', meaning that they are at a risk of being removed from the library	3
15920	3836	'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2', and '@CAPS3 to @ORGANIZATION3' are all examples of books that have been marked down as being offensive	4
15921	3836	These books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader	5
15922	3836	While one reader @MONTH1 love the story and wear out the pages, another @MONTH1 get halfway through and never finish it	6
15923	3836	However, the belief that there is freedom of choice in reading is correct	7
15924	3836	'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON1 is a classic example of a censored book	8
15925	3836	Throughout the book there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some	9
15926	3836	However, at the period of time the book was written, these words were not considered to be wrong	10
15927	3836	Books like this should be saved for older generations to read	11
15928	3836	however, we also have to realize that if a parent allows their children to read that book at a young age, there is nothing that can be done about it	12
15929	3836	None-the-less, removing the book from the library is not the correct response	13
15930	3836	Ever heard the saying 'learn from past mistakes'	14
15931	3836	Books are a fantastic way to learn about the past in a fun and enjoyable way	15
15932	3836	They are a tool of knowledge	16
15933	3836	Removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge	17
15934	3836	Every story has a unique style, which @MONTH1 appeal to some and not to others	18
15935	3836	Many books give readers a deeper understanding of what the time period was like when the book was written	19
15936	3836	'@ORGANIZATION2' has been a known censored book from the beginning due to its somewhat dark and gloomy aspects at certain points throughout the story	20
15937	3836	How many kids do we see at school carrying around one of the '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2' books	21
15938	3836	They often state that it is their favorite book of all time	22
15939	3836	If the book were to be removed from the library, it would cause many students to never have the opportunity to read a fantastically written book, which has a unique style about it	23
15940	3836	Throughout our twelve years of school, students are taught to think for themselves and make their own decisions	24
15941	3836	How are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp	25
15942	3836	If we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book, we are teaching poor life lessons.	26
15943	3837	I feel that there should not be censorship in libraries	0
15944	3837	All offensive material, as much as the more conservative patrons @MONTH1 not like it, should stay where they belong, which is in the library for all to read	1
15945	3837	I have several reasons I feel support my opinion about not removing material found offensive by some	2
15946	3837	My biggest reason is the learning capabilities these articles offer	3
15947	3837	Most works, even the more crude pieces, have some sort of educational value	4
15948	3837	Without articles based on the less comfortable or more gruesome items of life, people start to only understand in a surrreal sort of way, not understanding how the less fortunate things function or how to avoid them	5
15949	3837	Those who pursue a true wanting to gain knowledge will look at many different kinds of informational items, no matter the subject	6
15950	3837	Allowing this to occur is allowing the library to be used as in the way it was meant to be used for, a resource for knowledge	7
15951	3837	All offensive items a library @MONTH1 have stored should stay in that very spot, for learning purposes	8
15952	3837	No one should be denied the ability to learn just because of the sheilding nature of others.	9
15953	3838	All of us can think of or have this one book that we read and  hope none of our children or any other children have taken it off a shelf.Well at least I know I have a book like that, its called '@CAPS1'	0
15954	3838	I, myself personally feel that this book should be removed from the selves because for the simple fact it is over-rated and contains lots of violence and sex	1
15955	3838	A while back when I was in the seventh grade, I read this book called,'@CAPS1'	2
15956	3838	I was a good book but it was also very explesive	3
15957	3838	The book was mainly about this teen who had a rough childhood and was trying to make it through high school while being engaged in a abusive relationship, peer pressure, and a adiction to sex and drug	4
15958	3838	This book was exposing and very detailed, In which I strongly disagree with other children reading this book	5
15959	3838	I feel sex and violence shouldn't displayed in books or any other type of media	6
15960	3838	Inconclusion, I believe that certain materials such as books should be removed from the selves if they are found offensive	7
15961	3838	Books that display lots of sex and violence should be restricted and not able to leave the selves of libary unless their issued to someone eighteen or older	8
15962	3839	I am writing to the newspaper, about removing certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more	0
15963	3839	I dont think this should be allowed	1
15964	3839	I dont think it would be far to others	2
15965	3839	I'm going to give you three reasons why you shouldn't let people just remove stuff like that off of shelves	3
15966	3839	@CAPS1 first reason is that, what if you had a child and wanted he or she to see the same movie or book you did when you were little	4
15967	3839	But they took it off the shelves	5
15968	3839	That would be sad and you would want them to see the movie or book you did but they cant	6
15969	3839	Like what Katherine Paterson said 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'     @CAPS1 seceond reason is, what if you and a wife or husband had a favorite song, but they took it off the shelves	7
15970	3839	That would be devistating, it would just break your heart	8
15971	3839	Well I know it would me if it was are wedding song	9
15972	3839	The last reason and @CAPS1 favorite reason is, you just have your own opion	10
15973	3839	Everyone has thier own opion, if you dont want to see them or look at them just dont do it	11
15974	3839	It's as easy as that, just try to ignor it	12
15975	3839	It's really not your problem to worry about	13
15976	3839	Those are just three reasons why you should not let people remove anything off of any shelves	14
15977	3839	Like what Katherine Paterson said 'But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	15
15978	3839	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 if we let this happen everyone will take avanege of it	16
15979	3839	That is why I am @CAPS2 no to letting people remove anything off of any shelves	17
15980	3840	Should we censor books in libraries	0
15981	3840	Katherine Paterson, an author, once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	1
15982	3840	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	2
15983	3840	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 provides a very valid point	3
15984	3840	If we start taking off book that we find offensive, there will be none left	4
15985	3840	Books are meant to provide information and insight into someone's life	5
15986	3840	If we take away that book, it would be like saying that person's idea did not matter	6
15987	3840	The main reasons why we should not show censorship in libraries are a loss of insight, books, and personal creativity	7
15988	3840	Books provide insight into the author's life	8
15989	3840	Also the things that are happening in history affect the author's tone or style, like @ORGANIZATION1	9
15990	3840	During his lifetime, @CAPS2 was ruled by kings, so if he wanted to be successful, he had to appease the @LOCATION1	10
15991	3840	It also helped appeasing the @LOCATION1 since he was sponsoring @ORGANIZATION1's plays	11
15992	3840	Another example of an author influenced by his time and upbringing would be @CAPS3	12
15993	3840	He was alive during the middle ages, and he constantly saw oppressive things like serfs	13
15994	3840	When he wrote his tales, he made the high class people sort of mean while he made the lower caste people on the humbler side	14
15995	3840	@CAPS3 was not afraid to displease the @LOCATION1	15
15996	3840	If we start taking off books from shelves in a library that we think are offensive then soon there would not be any as Katherine Paterson said	16
15997	3840	Where one might find information, another might find it highly offensive and vice versa	17
15998	3840	Every book would have someone say it was offensive	18
15999	3840	It might be the context or the tone or even the person who wrote it	19
16000	3840	it does not matter	20
16001	3840	Sometimes the books that are the most informative are the ones that are offensive	21
16002	3840	However sometimes it is good to have offensive things in books	22
16003	3840	It builds the tone and mood of the story or character	23
16004	3840	It might create a certain image	24
16005	3840	It also teaches us not to what these people are doing	25
16006	3840	The books sometimes show us a depressing ending of a person who lived a vulgar or criminal life	26
16007	3840	These stories teaches us life lessons	27
16008	3840	Yes sometimes I read a book that I find offensive, but I have learned that if I do not like does not mean someone else does not	28
16009	3840	It would not be fair then to take off a book that someone might have learned something from just because you do not like it	29
16010	3840	I am sorry, the world does not revolve solely around you and me	30
16011	3840	It revolves us as a whole, and if someones starts taking off books, who is to stop someone else from doing the same	31
16012	3840	It would not be fair	32
16013	3840	Finally, if we started taking off books, it would start influencing kids in thinking it was okay to throw away someone's creativity	33
16014	3840	It also make them think that there ideas would not matter and no one would be able to appreciate them	34
16015	3840	I for one do not like doing things, if they might offend someone	35
16016	3840	I could not imagine what it would be like in that type of society	36
16017	3840	Books are important to have	37
16018	3840	They teach us about events or people who were before our time or problems some people experience	38
16019	3840	It is important to be aware of what is going on around you	39
16020	3840	I grew up ignorant of big problems that were occuring in society	40
16021	3840	My parents tried to shield me from the bad news and creeps in society	41
16022	3840	Reading books is what opened my eyes to what life is really like	42
16023	3840	So taking off books from shelves would have hindered the process of me growing up	43
16024	3840	I would still be that ignorant little child thinking that life ends in a happily ever after	44
16025	3840	Unfortunatley most do not, but there are some that have a happy life	45
16026	3840	That is what books are for, to teach people about other people's experiences, the good and the bad	46
16027	3840	So @PERSON2 was wise in her observation	47
16028	3840	Who is to stop someone from taking off books once this processes has started?	48
16029	3842	Lets think in todays known world the childern and teens have access to pretty much everything	0
16030	3842	If you ask a teenager this same question should this stuff be tooken off the shelves	1
16031	3842	They might say no	2
16032	3842	If ask an adult how ever they are most likely going to say yes	3
16033	3842	The music that surrond young adults and childern isn't the best	4
16034	3842	Go ahead and listen you will be amazed	5
16035	3842	If they have access to it then they are going to take it and borrow it	6
16036	3842	I feel that most of the music and movies on shelves anywhere should be taken off	7
16037	3842	Now thats just my opinion	8
16038	3842	Even adults listen to this stuff and watch all of this stuff	9
16039	3842	I say that the reason why people are failing school is because of all this stuff	10
16040	3842	@CAPS1 you think about it they have so many rights that they shouldn't have	11
16041	3842	If there is anything offensive then it should be tooken off the shelves	12
16042	3842	They should be replaced with educational things	13
16043	3842	Lets go back to where it all began back @CAPS1 everytbing started to come out	14
16044	3842	Did you have most of this stuff growing up	15
16045	3842	You probably didn't	16
16046	3842	But now you can find anything almost anywhere	17
16047	3842	Which is kind of sad if you ask me	18
16048	3842	Magazines however are starting to bcome more like movies and music	19
16049	3842	Mainly with all the nudity and foul words that they show	20
16050	3842	If you look at atheltes it doesn't matter who it is they get in trouble for things they shouldn't of said	21
16051	3842	@CAPS1 they should be out teaching kids not to say this stuff	22
16052	3842	That right there will help out educatiion and what not	23
16053	3842	You can become a more responible adult by showing them whats right and whats wrong	24
16054	3842	Starting with what they listen to or what they watch	25
16055	3842	I'm not allowed to watch current things and yet I do anyway	26
16056	3842	Thats because my parents aren't giving me enough discipline and they didn't @CAPS1 I was little	27
16057	3842	If you let a child grow up to listen and watch what they want the odds they might not do good in school	28
16058	3842	One way you can help out is by hanging out with the chiold or childern	29
16059	3842	Even teens	30
16060	3842	Even though the don't want you too	31
16061	3842	Talk to them make conversatuions teach them right from wrong, @CAPS1 you teach a child right from wrong the outlook on school will be better	32
16062	3843	When you are taking your little kid to the library because they want a book you think 'hmmm, there isn't anything bad at the library its all education books.' @CAPS1 would you feel if your child wanted to check out a movie there	0
16063	3843	You would be ok with it because no one thinks there are bad images or movies at the library	1
16064	3843	A little girl could be with her mom at the library in the adualt section and they could see some things you would not want them to see	2
16065	3843	The romance books usually have girls on there half clothed and the guys in basically nothing	3
16066	3843	A child could easily see that and not know what it ment but they would have theat image in there head for a very long time.Some of the kids could go up to the movies section and pull out a scary movie that shows blood and guns	4
16067	3843	Its not just the kids seeing the stuff its everyone	5
16068	3843	A teen could easily get a book and not be paying attention and see stuff about the other gender	6
16069	3843	A couple could go in the library trying to find a good healthy funny movie, but could find a movie that would make them uncomfortable	7
16070	3843	An older person could try to find some music from back in their time but when they get it, all of it is about drugs, sex, or even acohole	8
16071	3843	The magazines always have girls half clothed, even in seventeen magazine	9
16072	3843	The car magazines of girls modeling infront of the cars to make them look better or irristable	10
16073	3843	You can get a baby magazine and it shows a mom breast feeding	11
16074	3843	You could have jsut wanted to look at if because of the babies you or your child do not want to see a mom breast feeding	12
16075	3843	The library is a very resourcful place and you can get very good information about things there	13
16076	3843	They have some bad parts about them too	14
16077	3843	I think they music that talks about personal things and bad things should be in its own little place	15
16078	3843	Same with the magazines, movies and books they should all be in a room together away from all the rest of the items in the library	16
16079	3843	They should have an age limit you have to be to be able to go in that room	17
16080	3843	They should tell you what type of stuff is in there before you go in	18
16081	3843	I'm not saying the library is a bad place for kids or teens or anyone	19
16082	3843	I just think that certain books, music, and magazines should be kept in a different place instead of out in the open where everyone can see them.	20
16083	3844	Libraries are stocked filled of all kind of reading materials	0
16084	3844	Such as books, magazines, and catalogs, but are all of these appropriate for the crowd that dwindle around a library	1
16085	3844	My answer is no, but should they be taken away from the librabires, no	2
16086	3844	Although many kids go through libraries so do many adults trying to find good pieces of litature, that is why they should keep these books available to most	3
16087	3844	When i was in the seventh grade i recall reading a book, by the title of @PERSON2, about a child who had gotten sexually abused, i wish i had never picked up that book	4
16088	3844	Although it made me very frightened, it taught me a very good lesson	5
16089	3844	I learned at a young age to never associate with strangers, and if it wasn't for this novel it could have been very different	6
16090	3844	Therefore i believe it is good to get children at a young age small dosages of the real life, not every thing in the world is sugar coated like @PERSON3 would argue	7
16091	3844	From @CAPS1 to the bible, there is a vast variety of litature	8
16092	3844	This variety provides stories for many audiences	9
16093	3844	The libraries try to do there best by catagorizing these books so that smaller children do not get there hands on the wrong books	10
16094	3844	Instead of taking the books totally out of the repitoure, another suggestion that could be made is to have a system like they do for mature rated video games and only allow people over the age of @NUM1 to check certain books out	11
16095	3844	This making it near impossible for children to get there hands on the wrong books	12
16096	3844	Lastly, a suggestion that could be made is to label inappropriate books such as @CAPS2.Ds and movies	13
16097	3844	This could make a small difference and make children think twice before opening up a book labelled for mature audiences only	14
16098	3844	This providing stories for all, and protecting small children from magazines such as @CAPS3	15
16099	3844	Like Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	16
16100	3844	But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf..	17
16101	3844	then you also have the same right and so does everyone else	18
16102	3844	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I percieve what she is trying to say is similar to what i am	19
16103	3844	She wants all the books to be provided and kids just to be shyed away from these, and hope that children can make the right decision when choosing a piece of litature from a library	20
16104	3846	Censorship, a very sensitive topic	0
16105	3846	@CAPS1 are so many things people dislike, so they censor @CAPS2, hiding the idea's from the people who don't know about @CAPS2	1
16106	3846	I personally detest censorship	2
16107	3846	I would rather the world be an educated place with minor dangers, then a place where everything is kept secret and safe	3
16108	3846	You must be thinking, '@CAPS1 are some things we have to censor, @CAPS2 can harm our childrens minds.' But in truth, your children will find out about @CAPS2 in the real world eventually anyway	4
16109	3846	In reality, drugs, alchohol, sex, rape, violence, and all the other things you censor are common things that your kids will hear about	5
16110	3846	Most children first hear about @CAPS2 in school, normally elementary, and if not they will definately find out in junior high	6
16111	3846	If they will eventually find out anyway, wouldn't @CAPS2 be better to let them find out the easy way	7
16112	3846	Now you must be thinking, 'But if they find out too young, @CAPS2 could tramatize them.' That is a risk, but most teenagers are more tramatized anyway when exposed to @CAPS2 without any prior knowledge	8
16113	3846	If they already know what their dealing with they would know how to react, but if they have no knowledge of whats going on they could make a major mistake without even realizing @CAPS2	9
16114	3846	Once again, wouldn't @CAPS2 be better they find out from you or a book, then find out the hard way	10
16115	3846	Now, you @MONTH1 be thinking, 'Our children must be protected, this knowledge could just put them in more danger.' @CAPS2 @MONTH1 put them in more danger, @CAPS2's always a possibility	11
16116	3846	The world is full of possibilities though, anything could happen	12
16117	3846	This knowledge that you always hide from them @MONTH1 be what they need to know later on, and wont know when they need @CAPS2	13
16118	3846	What would they do if they see their friends start doing drugs, and since they have never heard of drugs, they don't know @CAPS2's a bad thing to do	14
16119	3846	Or if they see older kids drinking, and are offered a drink, but dont know they shouldn't take @CAPS2	15
16120	3846	Or if they wind up kissing someone they like, and @CAPS2 goes too far, but they don't know what their doing	16
16121	3846	Anything could happen, and your children need to be prepared	17
16122	3846	If they don't know of these things, they can't tell if what their doing is good or bad, and they @MONTH1 wind up getting in trouble or hurt	18
16123	3846	Tell them, or let them read the books you always censor at the libraries so that they know	19
16124	3846	Life is full of risks, so let them know, that way when the time comes their ready.	20
16125	3847	As I walked through @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 as a young girl I saw a @CAPS2 magazine book, seeing this and being a girl that likes reading that magazine I opened it	0
16126	3847	I soon found out it was a book that I would never actually read	1
16127	3847	I found my self embarrassed  and wondering why they wouldn't make it clearer that it should be censored	2
16128	3847	I think that censorship in libraries and book stores is a good thing	3
16129	3847	Yes, kids need to learn about relationships and intimacy, but that is their parents jobs	4
16130	3847	A @NUM1 year old girl should not be able to see an inappriate movie, magazine or book when ever she wants because we need to teach them ourselves	5
16131	3847	Censoring magazines gives children a chance to find who they are not what the world wants them to be	6
16132	3847	Censoring the book helps by keeping small children 'sheltered' they don't have to know everything by age ten	7
16133	3847	It gives them time to grow up themselves	8
16134	3847	The movies that are made give a false out look on what sex and intimacy really is	9
16135	3847	You flip through magazines and see child stars everywhere feeling the pressure to grow up	10
16136	3847	They think they have to dress like an adult and act like one too	11
16137	3847	Children see this and think that if @PERSON1 acts like that so should I	12
16138	3847	The magazine industry really hurts children in the long run	13
16139	3847	They put the super skinny model in a barely there bikini	14
16140	3847	Sports @CAPS3 prides its self on that	15
16141	3847	Maxim has the '@CAPS4 @NUM2 a bunch of @CAPS8 laying around in clothes that barely cover them	16
16142	3847	The boys all think that its @CAPS4 and that that's what every girl is supposed to look like	17
16143	3847	They get the @CAPS5  magazines and drool over how the center fold looks	18
16144	3847	Letting small children see this makes them think that they have to dress and act a certain way	19
16145	3847	It makes them think of you dress like this when you get older you can get all the boys too	20
16146	3847	Today there are so many books on how to keep your man happy, how to spice up the bedroom, @NUM3 things to try in bed tonight that a child could just walk and see	21
16147	3847	Many of these books have images of how do this and that	22
16148	3847	That it could really make a child and his or her parent(s) feel very uncomfortable	23
16149	3847	When yougo to @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 or any book store they have a relationship, love section that are all these kinds of books	24
16150	3847	Many young people @MONTH1 think love, oh I bet that's @CAPS7 or a @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 book	25
16151	3847	They see the cover that intrigue them	26
16152	3847	They think oh this girl is pretty.Censoring these books can give an ease to kids and parents	27
16153	3847	The kids can just grow up the way that they should	28
16154	3847	Now movies give a very large false pretence on what sexual intercorse really is	29
16155	3847	They see the people do all these things and they think that its normal and you don't have to worry about a thing, but kids here's the kicker sex is not just sex	30
16156	3847	When you have sex you have to make sure you are safe	31
16157	3847	This isn't just fun and games	32
16158	3847	In @LOCATION1 today many young @CAPS8 get raped	33
16159	3847	Does it show that on the movie no it doesn't, many young @CAPS8 as little as five go around thinking about how awful it was to raped, but yet we set back and let pornography be made	34
16160	3847	Pornography is false, @CAPS8 don't just look at eachother andget turned on	35
16161	3847	Sex is never going to just be sex, and by censoring the movies kids don't get that idea before they really learn and have the knowledge of what sex really means and is	36
16162	3847	Censoring is something that I strongly believe in	37
16163	3847	To this day my parents still make sure the movies we pick are appropriate	38
16164	3847	Parents and children can learn about sex whenever they want, but some parents choose to wait	39
16165	3847	By putting those movies and those books in a separate area it gives parents the chance to teach their kids, and the kids time to grow	40
16166	3848	Katherine Paterson wrote, ''If I had the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor~~ then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.'' quote.Having the right to do something is a part of freedom of speech almost	0
16167	3848	Its believing in your decesion or choice you have made	1
16168	3848	If I were to reflect my views on censorship in libraries, we all would have that same oppurtunity to state our opinion about what we feel should not be included	2
16169	3848	There could be unappropriate books in the library that we absolutly would not want our younger group of siblings reading	3
16170	3848	The best thing is to ask ourselves, Should we have the right to take our kids freedom an right to read, listen to, updated media and publications from them when we had it	4
16171	3848	Should we put a censorship on the libraries really	5
16172	3848	I feel that censoring a library would not be nessarry considering a library is a manual guide of history	6
16173	3848	Our libraries or organized from A to @CAPS1  in authors names, seperated from non fiction an fiction, cd's seperated in one section, movies one section, magazines, and adult books from children book seperated in diffrent sections	7
16174	3848	Libraries all across the world has had a kid that might have choose a book that was not appropriate for them to read but what kid hasn't	8
16175	3848	What would a book hurt them if theres plenty of  bad influces, peer presure, violence, and sexually publicity everywhere and @PERCENT1 in the media	9
16176	3848	It would not be fair at all for us to rob our kids of the chance to read and learn from books	10
16177	3848	I feel no we should not take our learning form our babies	11
16178	3848	Growing up as a kid I loved being able to go to the library it helped to enhance my vocabulary, spelling and which I learned plenty new words	12
16179	3848	Books I read growing up wasn't perfectly @NUM1 but I could relate to alot of books I choose as a kid so no I feel we should not censor libraies we need them to be a fun place to our children and us to go to for learning, fun, confort and etc	13
16180	3848	We can't take that from our generation it just would not be right.	14
16181	3849	Having offensive books and movies in a library shouldn't be allowed	0
16182	3849	If you were in a library and you saw a book or anything that you took offensive, more than likely someone else will find it offensive too	1
16183	3849	So, by eliminating the problem before anyone else sees it, will reduce problems before they even happen	2
16184	3849	Now, more then ever, you will find offensive things in libraries	3
16185	3849	More people get offended by lesser things now	4
16186	3849	One reason to have a censorship in libraries is that, if you had a child, would you want them going to the library and seeing derrogitory writings and movies	5
16187	3849	I would be very upset if my child had to see that	6
16188	3849	It's teaching them different values and it's teaching them that since it's in a library it must be okay to do out in the community	7
16189	3849	For example, if the library has a book or movie about doing drugs or anything sexual, they're going to look up to that and more then likely do those things, which they could end up harming themselves or others	8
16190	3849	If the goverment provides the taxes for the libraries, doesn't it show that our goverment doesn't care about the offensive items on the shelves	9
16191	3849	It gives them a bad name	10
16192	3849	If we look to our goverment for support and answers	11
16193	3849	How would we feel if they had no judgement about the offensive things in libraries	12
16194	3849	It would seem like they didn't care and that might cause panic throughout the country.Which would cause many more problems then needed	13
16195	3849	It would be a easier thing just to censor our libraries	14
16196	3849	If our libraries weren't consumed with negative and offensive literature, we would have a lot more room for things of greater value	15
16197	3849	We could have books and movies that are educational and will actually teach a person something	16
16198	3849	Rather than, lead them into making bad decisions	17
16199	3849	There are plenty of other sites and places you could get a book if you really wanted it	18
16200	3849	Not just the library has books	19
16201	3849	You could find one quite easily if you tried	20
16202	3849	If a library does have offensive things,  I think they wouldn't have a large variety, so it would be a better decision just to look for it elsewhere, where you could find a larger quantity of the subject you are looking for	21
16203	3849	When I go to the library, I go there for educational books, not books that teach kids how to 'fill a bong' or 'different sex postitions.' I highly disagree and I think it's a negative outlook on our society by putting those things in our future generation's hands to read	22
16204	3849	So by putting censorship in our libraries, not only will calm down some of the problems that are re-occuring in our communities, it just might eliminate the problem completely.	23
16205	3851	A lot of people believe that books are useless and should not even be on a shelf	0
16206	3851	Well I believe that no book is useless nor should it be removed from shelves from any library	1
16207	3851	All books are worth something toward anything like careers, and being able to learn new things	2
16208	3851	Magazines @MONTH1 not be any help towards alot of things like books are, but they are something to entertain you	3
16209	3851	Music is not just something you listen to, but its something to help keep you nice and relaxed while you are reading a book	4
16210	3851	Movies can have a certain impact on someone	5
16211	3851	alot of people think movies are just entertainment for them to watch, but it could have some encouragement, or it can really show how a person acts if you really pay attention and look into what the movie is saying	6
16212	3851	No book, magazine, music, or movies should be taken off shelves because they are not there for you to read or listen to or watch, but those things are all there to tell people something about things people do not even know	7
16213	3851	People should take a second look at how all of these things can really affect a persons life	8
16214	3851	More books, magazines, music, and movies should be put in the libraries of school, or even the public libraries.The more people read, watch, or listen to these things the better they @MONTH1  understand life	9
16215	3851	I have noticed from experience that people just go to the library and read a book just to relax, but yet at the same time those people really do not understand what they are reading	10
16216	3851	Its really a shame that people do not look into what they are reading, thats why it would be important for more books to be put on the shelves	11
16217	3851	Just like Katherine Paterson said: 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf , the work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	12
16218	3851	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If people really understood what that quote really means then they would have a better understanding of what books actually mean in life	13
16219	3851	We should be thankful to have authors like Katherine Paterson in our life because these authors are there to help us understand the meaning of these amazing books in this world.	14
16220	3852	A library is a public place for all ages	0
16221	3852	They have many different kinds of books for specific reasons	1
16222	3852	For the children they have a nice comfy spot for them to pick a book and sit down and read it	2
16223	3852	For adults they have coffe tables, sofa seats, and many different things while they read their books	3
16224	3852	never should a library have to disclousre certain materials because of the ages that come in and out	4
16225	3852	Censoring a library would not make it any easier to keep young children away from certain materials that are offensive	5
16226	3852	I feel that when a child is in a library they should go to their specific areas for which they came for, they should also be monitored while in the library	6
16227	3852	Most kids woldn't go to a book that doesn't have a lot of pictures or colors in it any way	7
16228	3852	The library is a public place and is made for all ages, even though there are book stores that sell just adult books, movies, and magazines, they still shouldn't throw them out of a library	8
16229	3852	There should be equal rights all over, yes even in libraries	9
16230	3852	The world is full of offensive things period	10
16231	3852	Now while a child a is not within a library they could be at home or in a public place and see things that they could also see in a book at the library	11
16232	3852	The removal of certain books, movies, and magazines wouldn't really stop anything	12
16233	3852	I think that if the parents teach thier children right from wrong there is nothing wrong with them being in a library that has adult books, movies, and magazines	13
16234	3852	If I owned a library I personally would not mind all kinds of books that are appropriate to a certain exstint in my selction of books	14
16235	3852	I have been to plenty of libraries and have seen stuff that I thought shouldn't be in thier but at the same I was not in my right section or doing what I was supposed to be doing	15
16236	3852	This subject really doesn't bother me, so no I don't think they should remover certain books just because children are in the library.	16
16237	3853	Censorship          @CAPS1 was the last time someone told you what you could, and couldn't do	0
16238	3853	Especially if it was somthing you didn't want to do	1
16239	3853	How'd that make you feel	2
16240	3853	You probably didn't want to do it did you	3
16241	3853	Censorship is somewhat the same way	4
16242	3853	The other day, my friends and i wanted to go see a new movie that just came out	5
16243	3853	We weren't aloud to see it though	6
16244	3853	You know why	7
16245	3853	Due to censorship, we weren't old enough to be able to see this movie	8
16246	3853	So, now the only way we'll be able to see this movie is if our parents go with us	9
16247	3853	Have you ever had your parents go with you and your friends	10
16248	3853	Doesn't go so well does it	11
16249	3853	Censorship violates freedom of being different	12
16250	3853	You can't listen to music, watch movies, or even read certain books, unless your of a certain age	13
16251	3853	That's not fair	14
16252	3853	Censorship is like a modern day @CAPS2	15
16253	3853	Tells you what you can and can't do, how you can dress, and what to say	16
16254	3853	Everybody would be the same then	17
16255	3853	How did @CAPS2 do with his idea, he failed miserably	18
16256	3853	How do you think the @CAPS4 victims felt, they were punished for believing, or doing something different	19
16257	3853	They weren't hurting anybody, they just wanted to live they're lives a diffent way	20
16258	3853	Thats what censorships doing, classifying people in to certain groups	21
16259	3853	telling them what they can and can't see, do, or listen to	22
16260	3853	Thats what makes the world different, people that are different	23
16261	3853	Dont't make everyone be the same.	24
16262	3854	Everyone has different views on works of literature, wheather it be books, magazines, movies, or music	0
16263	3854	If libraries were to removes this stuff from the shelves then they would be loosing business, they would be loosing children, and they would taking away the reason of it being on the shelves	1
16264	3854	These libraries would be loosing business to the people who maybe like the kind of stuff that they @MONTH1 not	2
16265	3854	The people running the business @MONTH1 decide to take out older pieces of work that @MONTH1 offend younger people in this generation	3
16266	3854	The stuff wrote, sang, or played in these things @MONTH1 harm these people but that is not what it is in there for	4
16267	3854	The things that harm people are in there to show people in the younger generations how life was lived in the older days, as in the slaves	5
16268	3854	This would play a roll on children that use this library also	6
16269	3854	If this literature was taken out, children @MONTH1 think that things have always been the way they are as they see it	7
16270	3854	If these children grew up and were to see a book, hear a song, or watch a movie about how things were in the olden days, and how much it has changed, then they @MONTH1 never believe it because they were not taught as children	8
16271	3854	As they are older, they @MONTH1 still never have the interest to learn about these types of things because they never knew about them growing up	9
16272	3854	These things are wrote to teach people and children about how things used to be, they are not used to harm people	10
16273	3854	When people take these things harmful, they are not getting the true meaning that the author had in mind when the wrote them	11
16274	3854	Libraries should keep these peices of literature on their shelves, only to teach young people of what the world has came from and how their older relatives lived, and what they came from	12
16275	3855	I feel that it should be censorship in libraries.Children shouldnt be able to go to the library and see certain books if they aren't supposed to.This could save people from getting in trouble and reading thye wrong stuff	0
16276	3855	There should be censorship in libraries.I feel that it should be censorship because they already have stores that contain certain things that kids aren't able to buy.One other reason that i feel that it should be censorship is because children will probably read something and take it the wromg way.When you are a kid and you know that there is something that you know for sure you shouldnt be reading or watching,you try your best to sneak and read or watch whatever it @MONTH1 be.Thats why if we had censorship,they wouldnt have a chane to do so.Another reason i say we should have censorship is because libraries are public, and if you have to be a certain age to look at or view something then you should nt have it in the library	1
16277	3855	As you can see,these are the reasons that i feel we should have censorship in libraries.With censorship nobody will feel left out and everyone will be treated equally and feel the same.They already have book stores and online site, where u can buy books and movies,and they have no censorship u just have to be a certain age and have a credit card.That way, they are for sure it is okay for you to rent things from them because you have to be a certain age to have a credit card.So with that being said,I feel there should be censorship in libraries.	2
16278	3856	The library is a place for people to go and read whatever they want	0
16279	3856	Some people just enjoy reading and others go to find information	1
16280	3856	People are allowed to read and write whatever they want and sometimes it might offend others but there's nothing you can really do about it	2
16281	3856	Sometimes there might be inapropriate books at the library or the super market but even if it doesnt apply to you it might to someome else, for instance say there's a book or magazine talking about being homosexual and you dont think it should be allowed but someone who is might find it interesting to see how other people deal with it	3
16282	3856	Another topic most people argue about is books about sex or drugs	4
16283	3856	Adults who have children don't want them reading about those things and in some ways they might because in a book it might show the reader how there bad for you and that you shouldnt do them	5
16284	3856	I know I ike reading books like that because it just shows me how it messes peoples lives up and I dont want to live like that	6
16285	3856	There are some things I dont think should be allowed like books, magizines, music, and movies about racialism	7
16286	3856	I don't think its right for people to talk about others just because there skin is a different color, they have just as much right to be here as we do	8
16287	3856	Another thing that bothers me are movies about people that have problems like adhd or down syndrome and other kids bullying them because its not there fault there like that and its just inapropriate	9
16288	3856	Some people don't realize what they write might hurt others  and sometimes they write them for that purpose and even though we @MONTH1 complain about them no good ever comes out of it because everyone has a freedom of speech and we just have to deal with it and go on with our lives	10
16289	3856	And if there are inapropriate things at the library you dont like or don't want your children to see then don't let them go.	11
16290	3857	I think that some material should be removed from the shelves if they are racist or contain unsightly images	0
16291	3857	But that brings up the question about racism almost all of the classic books have some form of racism in them such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that book uses the @CAPS4 word to describe african americans, but when that book was published that was common talk now people look at you like you have just murdered there first born child if youu were to use that word	1
16292	3857	For the most part though books are not all that offensive at least none of the books I read	2
16293	3857	I know that there are books and magazines such as playboy and maxim that are offensive to women and have probably cause a lot of breakups and divorces, but they have laws on who are able to buy things like that	3
16294	3857	I know that kids still have a way of owning magazines like that but they are a small percentage of the kids	4
16295	3857	I know that during @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 over in germany many books were banded because they had something to do with catholicism or something that @PERSON3 believed was bad and not what he believed was the perfect race	5
16296	3857	I know that for a short time alot of what @PERSON2 wrote was banned for using the @CAPS4 word but people have to realize that when @PERSON2 was alive that was everyday laungage	6
16297	3857	As for me being catholic there is a codex of forbidden books that is a list of books that I am not supposed to read as a good catholic	7
16298	3857	I have no idea what those books are and what got them on this list but they must be very rude and vulgar to be on this list	8
16299	3857	I can see how some of those books could be banned	9
16300	3857	As for music I think that the only music that should be banned is the kind of music that talks about killing police officers and hurting the people that are trying to make our country a safer place	10
16301	3857	I know that all of this rap genre is what my generation is into even though I dont see why kids like that kind of music	11
16302	3857	I also think that music produced by the arian brotherhood should not be allowed in libraries because there music is overtly racist	12
16303	3857	I dont think that movies shouyld be banned form the libraries because of violence or anytning of that nature	13
16304	3857	I do think that the movie should be banned if it contians anything of the nature of pornagraphy but they do not let those kinds of movie in the libraries anyway  so they are a step ahead of me	14
16305	3857	I do have to agree with Katherine Paterson on what she said that if I have those rights then everyone else does to and there will be no books on the shelves because someone will find that offensive then someone else will find something else offensive and soon eventually there will be no books left on the library shelves	15
16306	3857	My view of what I think is offensive is very relaxed compared to other's I do not get offended at a lot of things	16
16307	3858	The @CAPS1 Materials     Have you ever came acroos a book that you thought was really good, but knew it might show certain offense to someone you know	0
16308	3858	My censorship on materials that show offense in libraries is they should not be taking off the shelves	1
16309	3858	People should have ther own choice of books, and who has the right to tell someone what they should read	2
16310	3858	My opinion is that materials that @MONTH1 be offensive to certain individuals should not be taking off the shelf, but put in a certain section that says adult material such as books, music, movies,etc.	3
16311	3858	I myself have experienced not being able to get a certain movie because of my age	4
16312	3858	The book was called @CAPS2 @PERSON1, but it was just full of action/adventure.This was very unfair in my eyes, just because I was young I couldnt check out a certain movie	5
16313	3858	This was experience that I been through, which lead me to my opinion that materials that might show certain offenseto someone should not be removed	6
16314	3858	Another reason that the materials should stay on the shelf is because many people like different things	7
16315	3858	No one is going to have the same interest all the time	8
16316	3858	So by takiny materials away is just helping one person, but hurting many by taking somethimg they @MONTH1 be interested in	9
16317	3858	I can understand that people have been through things, and might not be happy that offensive materials are around	10
16318	3858	Then again I think all materials are not the same they can get the materials they enjoy, and leave the other materials up to other people to choose from	11
16319	3858	In conclusion I believe that the materials that show offense to certain people should stay	12
16320	3858	The reason being is because by the material that might show offense to an individual, might just be very interesting to another person	13
16321	3858	This a saying I heard before from the ebony magazine ,'another person junk @MONTH1 be someone else treasure' which I believe is a good saying for this topic	14
16322	3859	I do not feel these types of things should not be taken off the shelves.What i think is that thing should come with a rateing because  this is a free country and for some one to do something like that it would be takeing away someone's freedom of speach.To many people have faught in the past for just simply freedom of speach.I think that if people rate the  thing's  that come out then they will not go in to the wrong hands	0
16323	3859	That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 when it first came out off the market because it has violance in it ,profange language,and guns that company will had lost a lot of money because it is inapprotive for kids.I think that parent's shouldn't go buy a @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old something like that but some parents do .It not the creaters fault of the actions of how people react to what ever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responseable and make sure that what ever it is is supervised and carefully montoired	1
16324	3859	There's an old saying ' every thing isn't made for every body' .I strongly belive that;That saying is so true .Every body don't like the same thing that some one eles likes but its okay for that person but it's not okay for you because as they say everything isn't for every body and you can't fource nothing on some one.Well every thing isn't approtive  for every one we all have are limites to every thing and if you watch what kids watch and do than things want be so inapprotive for this wold 	2
16325	3859	Certion books young children should not read because they have sex in them and they talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age.When children read books like that they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff that why its there parent's responseabitly to montoir what there children read because that there job as parent's to do not the person who wrote the book because they @MONTH1 think there writing to a much older group that can relate to what there talking about but then again there just speacking there mind and infourceing there freedom of speach right one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for .I also feel that music help's us to express are selfs so if someone feels that the music is inapprotive for there child then they need to watch what there child is listen to.Music brings out the different moods in every body.All magazines are not for every one because as we all know there are adult magazines the produce certion imagary that children should not see but you can not blame the creater only the buyer is in fault for leaving it in the wrong place after there done with it .There just people trying to make money  off things that they know that people like.	3
16326	3860	Don't you hate when you come across a book that you wish was never written	0
16327	3860	I'm sure we all come to that point in our lives, constant readers, or not	1
16328	3860	Like a qoute i once read, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of children or any other children have taken off the shelf	2
16329	3860	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf then you also have exactly the same right and so does everone else	3
16330	3860	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'                         - Katherine Paterson, Author     If you ask me, I think there should be a certain autority to these books	4
16331	3860	Maybe if we could make a petition and have at least @NUM1 people sign it then the book could be removed	5
16332	3860	All of this goes for music, movies, magazines, even bibles in librarys	6
16333	3860	I'm not saying we should make a law that says if one person dosen't like something then no body should have the right to have it	7
16334	3860	But as a public if enough people all agree we shouldn't have something then maybe its best that we dont	8
16335	3860	We all worry about our children, having to keep a constant eye on them making sure there not getting into something there not supposed to be in	9
16336	3860	Same goes with books and movies, even music and magazines nowadays, and for certain people, even bibles	10
16337	3860	Now dont get me wrong, I'm sure we all know that when a child goes to a library and trys to check out an 'inapropriate' book then the checkout counter will deny the child and take the book	11
16338	3860	But just think for a minute here, That doesnt meen the child cant go into the library find a book and just read it there	12
16339	3860	Theres also the senario where, mind me it @MONTH1 not be your child but with todays crime records then this is very probable, the child could grab a book, magazine, even a film and just steal it	13
16340	3860	In the long run there are many things we can do to prevent things like this from happening	14
16341	3860	There could be an adult section of the library, not just for '@CAPS1' rated books or films but just a place where we can keep all the books we dont think children should be reading	15
16342	3860	Still we should definately have the option to petition off books we don't think our children should be reading	16
16343	3860	Think what you will but this is my opinion of library censorship, hopefully its yours now too.	17
16344	3861	Why Should you be offended	0
16345	3861	The @CAPS1 is a place where you come and get what you like.The Libraries are organized for a reason,what I like is my prefence.You don't have to look at it if you don't want to	1
16346	3861	Everyone has there own taste	2
16347	3861	Books, movies, music, and magazines are made for people to look at, read, watch	3
16348	3861	ect.	4
16349	3861	People have a prefence and they like to have it avaible when they want it	5
16350	3861	Libraries are great use for that	6
16351	3861	People go to get what they like to watch, read, and listen	7
16352	3861	And other people should not get offended by what other like	8
16353	3861	Most Libraries are organized into sections for children, young adults, and adults	9
16354	3861	If there is material that you don't think is 'ok' for that sections then you can ask for it to be removed to another section	10
16355	3861	But don't think something is offensive and make it be removed because you don't like it	11
16356	3861	How is that fare to others who might like it	12
16357	3861	If you are offended by a material that is in a section of the @CAPS1 that you think is not 'ok' then it ok for it to be moved to another section	13
16358	3861	You don't have to look at something if you don't like it	14
16359	3861	Someone else might like it	15
16360	3861	Libraries are made for all people, and everyone has there own taste	16
16361	3861	Don't be offended by what others like.	17
16362	3862	Libraries are a place for everyone	0
16363	3862	from young children, to the eldery, therefore there is material to suite all ages	1
16364	3862	When you go to a library you assume that no matter what kind of book you are wanting to read, they will have it	2
16365	3862	From personal prefrences, to school research projects, libraries should have it all right	3
16366	3862	Well some libraries want to take that concept away	4
16367	3862	A library has books on nearly all subjects	5
16368	3862	That is because of the individual differences of the people that go to the library	6
16369	3862	Someone of an extremist religion group could be going there to read on something of their religion	7
16370	3862	If a strict @CAPS1 would happen to find a book on the extreme religion they could be offended	8
16371	3862	That situation could go both ways though	9
16372	3862	Because of the individuality of people and different beliefs and customs we are all going to appreciate and depreciate all different kinds of literature	10
16373	3862	Most of the libraries are big enough to be sorted into sections	11
16374	3862	There are sections for young adults, mature adults, children, non fiction, fiction, science fiction, and so on	12
16375	3862	If a child ventures off to the mature adult section and flips through the pages of a book that is above their maturity level, then that is the childs fault	13
16376	3862	The mature people who can handle the content of more adult-orientated books shouldn't be punished by the library removing all books of that content because a child didn't stay in their designated area	14
16377	3862	With different cultural beliefs comes different beliefs and views of everyday things	15
16378	3862	Some readers could strongly disagree with a book and others could recommend it to all of their friends and family	16
16379	3862	One book to one person could mean something totally different to another	17
16380	3862	It could be understandable if there were books about sex, for example, right next to the childrens' books, but that isn't the case in most libraries	18
16381	3862	Libraries could even have a restricted section that warns readers about the content of material in the books in that specific area	19
16382	3862	Books in libraries are wrote for multiple kinds of people	20
16383	3862	Age, gender, religion, maturity, race, political beliefs, and so on will all effect the way you take to a book	21
16384	3862	Whether or not a book appeals to you is about your beliefs, values, or customs	22
16385	3862	With that being said, why would a library take away books that only a certain percentage of people will disagree with	23
16386	3862	Taking away books of a certain subject could upset people that like that type of book or it could even pertain to their everyday lives	24
16387	3862	A library is a place of knowlegde	25
16388	3862	It is filled with facts, beliefs, theories, and opinions of people	26
16389	3862	Wouldn't removing someones opportunity to read into a subject be revoking the author and their freedom of speech	27
16390	3862	Just because of a controversial subject or mature topic shouldn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed to read it	28
16391	3862	If people could only read certain literature that someone else is deciding whether or not it is okay to read, then where is their freedom	29
16392	3862	A library is a place for everyone	30
16393	3862	It has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people	31
16394	3862	A libraries interior could be arranged to that the young children aren't going to find a book about sex near their kid books	32
16395	3862	Taking away certain books pertaining to controversial subjects isn't fair to those who don't disagree with that topic	33
16396	3862	A library should be a place of balance	34
16397	3862	A place where someone could read on anything they want to, not what certain people think they should or shouldn't read	35
16398	3863	I believe everyone has the right to voice there own oppinion on life	0
16399	3863	If we censor ones books, music, or movies because they are inapropriate, it would be like silencing an oppinion that stands out among the others	1
16400	3863	If we silence the author and there story or song how will we be able to view life in another persons view	2
16401	3863	In the @ORGANIZATION1 we have the freedom of speech and press	3
16402	3863	these amendments make it so that otheres can voice an oppinion with out being shot down	4
16403	3863	Although we have the amendments there are still restrictions on what we are aloud to publish	5
16404	3863	Say we found a diary writen by @PERSON1	6
16405	3863	Are we aloud to view his deepest darkest thoughts	7
16406	3863	or Are we going to say that it is too dark and depressing for the average person's eyes	8
16407	3863	His ideas are different, does that mean we shouldn't show them	9
16408	3863	no we should show them, we need to educate people that there are indeed different ways of viewing life	10
16409	3863	I believe that no matter whos ideas it is, if aloud by the author, should be aloud to be read and comprehend in our own way	11
16410	3863	If one wishes to learn about how to murder in a @CAPS1 then i think they should be aloud to do so	12
16411	3863	The reason why	13
16412	3863	The @CAPS1 is becoming absolete, the technology era is officially here	14
16413	3863	There is not a thing we can't find in @CAPS1 that can't be found online	15
16414	3863	Although the @CAPS1 is a government run facility, many people will go elsewhere to find the materials wanted to view the censored media	16
16415	3863	It is true that if we allowed 'censored' material into a @CAPS1 a child could find it	17
16416	3863	But like the internet you can block things from those kids	18
16417	3863	All voices need to be heard, even if it is racist, sexist, biest, or just insane	19
16418	3863	these are ways to view the persepective or the reason behind hate and war	20
16419	3863	if we can learn from other mind sets through books, music, movies and movies, then i think we should be aloud to	21
16420	3863	Nothing should be blocked from the public	22
16421	3863	Every one has the right to voice there own oppinion through there own way.	23
16422	3864	KEEP @CAPS1 ON THE SHELF	0
16423	3864	I think we should not get rid of any books that are in the library	1
16424	3864	If we did that then there wouldn't be any books left	2
16425	3864	The only thing we should be worried about is the rated @CAPS2 movies	3
16426	3864	Yeah those can be taken out of the library	4
16427	3864	If one book is offensive to someone, then dont get it, but someone else might like that book	5
16428	3864	For example, an older woman is looking through this magazine, and she sees this teenage woman taking drugs, or being half naked	6
16429	3864	Although the teen sitting right next to her likes that gossip	7
16430	3864	We shouldn't get rid of any books because then we would only be down to one genre	8
16431	3864	There wouldn't be any categories left in the library	9
16432	3864	A good idea is to separate the books, put the ones that seem offensive in the back	10
16433	3864	keep the childrens books away from the big mystery horror books	11
16434	3864	Another example is this	12
16435	3864	A student goes to the library to work on a history report over slavory, but there isn't any books on slavory because somebody thought it was offensive against african americans	13
16436	3864	I understand that there is reasons why some books are taken out of the library because of some sexual content	14
16437	3864	Children do not need to be around those kinds of books	15
16438	3864	Or some books being taken out because of religious belifs	16
16439	3864	like one book being taken out because it was about worshiping the devil, or something	17
16440	3864	The movie situation i understand	18
16441	3864	I wouldn't want my little daughter walking up and grabbing something that has a sex scene, or drug content in it	19
16442	3864	You can take those off the shelf, but wait, right there is another example of why it shouldn't get taken off the shelf	20
16443	3864	Just because i want it off the shelf doesn't mean everybody wants it off the shelf	21
16444	3864	Then the libraries movie business would be over	22
16445	3864	To sum everything up, nobody should choose what should be in the library and what shouldn't	23
16446	3864	Personally i think that there should be a variety in the library	24
16447	3864	If not everybody would get bored of the same books	25
16448	3864	Over and over	26
16449	3864	KEEP @CAPS1 ON THE SHELF	27
16450	3865	Katherine Paterson, who is an author, thought that if a book was not one that she would want her children to read that it should be taken off the shelf at the library	0
16451	3865	If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want that book removed from your sight and public view	1
16452	3865	Personally, I wouldn't	2
16453	3865	I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others	3
16454	3865	In this essay, I will explain from my personal experience @CAPS5 I disagree with Katherine Paterson	4
16455	3865	In the sixth grade, I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system	5
16456	3865	We had to find certain books in our school library, using this system, as an assignment	6
16457	3865	One of the books we had to find was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2	7
16458	3865	I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like	8
16459	3865	But there was a child in my class who had never seen a @CAPS2 in her life	9
16460	3865	After helping her find the @CAPS2, she ask, '@CAPS5 is this book so important to people	10
16461	3865	I don't understand it.' I explained to her in the best of my ability the life of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 this was important to me	11
16462	3865	She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about	12
16463	3865	It is against the law in some states that a @CAPS2 be in school at all	13
16464	3865	This is because of others beliefs or non-beliefs	14
16465	3865	If it were not for the library having the @CAPS2 on a shelf that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her	15
16466	3865	A book can be offensive to other people but that book can change a person's life forever	16
16467	3865	Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries	17
16468	3865	Unfortunatley, other people think this also	18
16469	3865	One book can change a person's life, what if that book was not in the library to change another?	19
16470	3866	I feel that a library can have any kind of book stating any kind of material	0
16471	3866	Its a library, a place where people go to get information	1
16472	3866	If you dont want your kid, or kids reading, watching, or listening to those kinds of material then you shouldn't have to let them read, listen to or watch any offensive material, untill they are at a certain age and are mature enough about it	2
16473	3866	It is a library, and they are gonna have a wide variety of books	3
16474	3866	I dont think any book should be removed just because someone gets offended or its to ghory or has to many curse words for your kid	4
16475	3866	Not everyone gets offended by the same things, or the same material	5
16476	3866	If you do then dont read that book or watch that movie, but that shouldn't mean it has to be taken off the shelf just because one person got offended by it	6
16477	3866	Libraries are made for the community and the people in it, not just one person	7
16478	3866	Other people might want to read or watch the material that some people get offended by	8
16479	3866	This is what I think on the censorship on the book, movies, music, magazine, etc	9
16480	3866	Its a library, they are going to have a bunch of material	10
16481	3866	If you find something offensive, be mature, put it back and find something else to read, watch or listen to	11
16482	3867	In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
16483	3867	Many people @MONTH1 feel upset if they find a book or magazine or any type of material that is inappropiate for anyone to see/hear	1
16484	3867	Inappropiate material is commonly referred to as pictures and or words that @MONTH1 offend people	2
16485	3867	The words in songs can be offensive	3
16486	3867	Talking about girls in disrespectful ways in music can offend girls and listeners	4
16487	3867	Pictures can also be offensive in many ways such as sex, race, and violence	5
16488	3867	I believe that, if a book, music, movies, or magazines upset you then you should stay away from that section or just that material in particular	6
16489	3867	If you have been to a library you see that kids mainly stay in the kids section anyways	7
16490	3867	and if you're an adult then you should be mature enough to ignore what bothers you	8
16491	3867	I have been in a library a few times in my life	9
16492	3867	When I search for what im looking for, I ignore what offends me or upsets me	10
16493	3867	In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	11
16494	3867	My answer is no, for the reasons I have listed above	12
16495	3867	People should be mature enough to stay away from and not let the offensive materials in a library get to them	13
16496	3868	Whose to say what is appropriate for whom	0
16497	3868	whose to judge right and wrong for anyone	1
16498	3868	It depends on a point of view like most things	2
16499	3868	The sheltered must learn one day, and if kids learn now about the truth, such as, not to stick forks in outlets, then they won't be as curious when they are older	3
16500	3868	Being sheltered is not always a good thing and censor ship of what we read, watch, or listen to is ridculous, and disrespectful to authors	4
16501	3868	In matters of censorship, I find it to be pointless	5
16502	3868	Censorship doesn't prevent your kids from learning about anything, except mother won't let me watch that	6
16503	3868	it just keeps your kids more curious and more obligated to hide things from you and like they cannot ask you questions or be open and honest with you	7
16504	3868	Causes children to go behind your back more and when they're in trouble they'll as if your they're last place where they can ask for help, where you should be they're first resort	8
16505	3868	No, I do not believe that libraries should censor anything	9
16506	3868	Its altering a authors work	10
16507	3868	How would it feel if you had written something and it had been published and was in the library and didn't like something about it so they decided to just bleep it out or not allow certain people to read it	11
16508	3868	I believe censorship should be illegal not required	12
16509	3868	Sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing, and discovering the real world	13
16510	3868	The idea that the world has no evil, or hiding the evil from your children will in most cases cause them to rebel and in other cases leave them unprepared for the future and the real world	14
16511	3868	Wouldn't you rather be able to help your kids and teach them about things instead of tell them that everything is perfect and only bad people use that kind of language	15
16512	3868	Or make them feel like a bad person for do something your grandparents did when they were young	16
16513	3868	I conclude that censorship is injust, unfair, and is the real wrong	17
16514	3868	Not the profanity or the violence that will one day be apart of their life in some way	18
16515	3868	You don't go through everyday in the 'real world' with a mindset of there's nothing wrong in this world	19
16516	3868	Or everything is censored and everything is controlled  I believe censorship is just another way of controlling the mind through nuture	20
16517	3869	I believe that it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for offensive reasons	0
16518	3869	I feel this way for several reasons, but three in particular	1
16519	3869	First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer	2
16520	3869	Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away	3
16521	3869	Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make	4
16522	3869	First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer	5
16523	3869	People come to libraries to look at what they're interested in to entertain themselves	6
16524	3869	@CAPS1 should be all types of literation in the library for all types of people, because everyone doesn't think alike	7
16525	3869	Everytime an item is removed off of a shelf, @CAPS1 will be an unsatisfied customer	8
16526	3869	Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away	9
16527	3869	Libraries always have some type of organization	10
16528	3869	In order to not offend anyone, items should be divided into their own categories inside their own sections	11
16529	3869	This solution will prevent anyone from seeing something that offends them	12
16530	3869	If that doesn't help, librarians should post a sign stating what type of objects are inside on the front door, so everyone knows before they enter	13
16531	3869	Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make	14
16532	3869	A customers' needs and wants should be met at all times, unless a customer is trying to run the business as if it was their own	15
16533	3869	If a particular library chooses to have certain types of items, because they know what what readers' like, then no one else should involve theirself	16
16534	3869	If I owned a library, I would be upset if a customer removed a book off a shelf, because they would be interfering with my business	17
16535	3869	In conclusion, I beleve it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for three reasons	18
16536	3869	First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading	19
16537	3869	Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away	20
16538	3869	Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make	21
16539	3869	I believe I expressed my opinion to the fullest	22
16540	3869	Although some people @MONTH1 disagree with the way I feel, I'm sticking with it	23
16541	3869	@CAPS1 defintly wouldn't be any books left for any of us if items were removed for offensive reasons.	24
16542	3870	Newpaper company,@CAPS1 am writing to this company on why I think the certain books, music, movies and magazine should be removed form the shelves if they are found offensive	0
16543	3870	@CAPS1 wirting to tell you from my own experience and readings that will convince a argument	1
16544	3870	@CAPS1 reflecting my view on censorship in libraries	2
16545	3870	@CAPS1 writing so you can hear me out on what I have to say and persuasive you on this essay	3
16546	3870	First, I think know book should be taking off on any shelf of any library	4
16547	3870	Rather if it was to do with people thoughts on religious, race or any other thing that has been offensive to anyone in the past	5
16548	3870	For example, gay and lesbian marriage peoples thoughts and opinion on this topic	6
16549	3870	I beileve that know one should disrespect anyone opinion on what they have to say	7
16550	3870	It depends on what kind of language your using for this type of subject if its has harsh words and its suppose to be harmful, then yes it should be remove	8
16551	3870	Another thing is children taken books off shelves	9
16552	3870	Maybe you should ascort your child in the child section and telling him or her what they should not do like taking stuff down that they are not suppose to	10
16553	3870	What I'm saying is if suppose to hurt other and is offensive using negatively words to harm others feelings, it should be remove	11
16554	3870	My letter to you was to show you on my opinion on what I think should be in a library or not	12
16555	3870	I have use some examples and common sense to show you my point of view on what I think is right or wrong in this situation	13
16556	3870	I hope my topics and argurment has convince you on if you should remove a book from a shelf	14
16557	3870	@ORGANIZATION1	15
16558	3871	Are there universally evil books that no one should read	0
16559	3871	Are good and bad no longer matters of opinion for the readers themselves	1
16560	3871	The answer is no	2
16561	3871	Censorship is a terrible practice masquerading as a boon	3
16562	3871	The right to read certain books should not be left to a conservative few, because everyone has their own opinion about everything	4
16563	3871	There is always something we can potentially learn from books, and it's never right to take that away	5
16564	3871	Freedom of speech should certainly come into play here as well, allowing the authors' words to be heard without interference from those who would dictate what we read	6
16565	3871	There is a reason libraries have many sections	7
16566	3871	They have to cater to the individual tastes of the masses, without regard to what other people find offensive	8
16567	3871	If one was to go through the library and burn every book they did not like, there would be scarcely anything left	9
16568	3871	Send in another person with different tastes, and then you have a completely empty library	10
16569	3871	It is far better to leave all the books alone so that everyone can find something to enjoy reading	11
16570	3871	Basically, there are bound to be people who have similar opinions to the author of just about anything, so allow the authors to share those opinions	12
16571	3871	Then we have the knowledge portion of the issue	13
16572	3871	Offensive material to one person might be what another person wants or needs to read, whether for recreation or class	14
16573	3871	There is much to be learned in the way of psychology and human nature from almost any writing	15
16574	3871	Perhaps a restricted section would be in order if the problem would involve corruption of innocent minds, but a full censor would never be necessary	16
16575	3871	Finally, there is an amendment in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 for preventing censorship	17
16576	3871	It is unconstitutional to restrict any form of expressive speech, whether it be books, movies, music, or magazines	18
16577	3871	And what is more restrictive to an author than to have their books banned	19
16578	3871	The greatest difference between our country and a totalitarian government is the simple freedom allowed in the @LOCATION1	20
16579	3871	If we start restricting that freedom, what are we then	21
16580	3871	In short, censorship is a harmful practice that should never be used	22
16581	3871	People all have their own opinions, all media can be learned from, and our freedom should not be restricted	23
16582	3871	The practice of censorship is what should truly be banned from the shelves.	24
16583	3872	Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 is it safe to draw the line on what kids should or should not see as far as the world is concerned	0
16584	3872	What makes kids behave better, being sheltered from life or being life smart and knowing what is going on in this world	1
16585	3872	I think its safe to say what we do or do not want our kids to do, say ect	2
16586	3872	But in other terms do we have full conrol of our kids @NUM1	3
16587	3872	I knw that this might sound wierd but I strongly believe in the simple fact hat kids are being over sheltered to day	4
16588	3872	Our kids are groing up with the new technology	5
16589	3872	Its the centry for computers and laptops and gaming systems	6
16590	3872	Our kids dont know what its like to go out side anymore	7
16591	3872	The world has so much to offer us yet, we turn it down beacuse we see what all the new advances have to offer as well	8
16592	3872	I think it is very important to be books smart as well as street smart, if you spend all your @CAPS3 doing one thing at at @CAPS3 you are gonna end up lacking on one thing	9
16593	3872	I blelieve grades will come	10
16594	3872	I think that our kids are over sheletered for the simple fact that when our kids see something that we dont want them to see, or there not ready for then there not allowed to see it it, but whos to say on the days your not watching them that there not going to go in the real world and just see exactly what you didnt want them too	11
16595	3872	This is why its important for you to teachyour child what is going on in the world and noth leave them in the dark	12
16596	3872	Also we are living in the new age of life, were computers and laptops are the number one thing in the world right now for people to be usign and on throught the day	13
16597	3872	It is hard for kids to understand the realness of life since ever thing is done over the internet now	14
16598	3872	It is a privilage to be so far advanced in the world yet we still dont know what to do	15
16599	3872	As we get older we are not gonna know nearly as much stuff as need to be known and taught beacuse as we get older were gettomg, more logic and more information over the materials on the web	16
16600	3872	Kids will not know how to fix cars or know to start up a lawm mower	17
16601	3872	I think that books should not be taken off te shelf beacuse as the day goes by kids reality is getting taken and taken more and more	18
16602	3872	I think that it is a big deal what kids learn about the everyday life becuse that is our future and if they have no idea what is going on and it scares me beacuse the are going to be alot more battles for our kids to fight we just have to teach them all that we can and hope that they become the best people they can be in life 	19
16603	3872	Thank You for Your @CAPS3	20
16604	3872	Deven	21
16605	3873	Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1 has been around for as long as their has been the various mediums of art	0
16606	3873	In many cases the censorship @CAPS9 of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy	1
16607	3873	But then in other more serious issues that the censor has deemed not suitable for a certain audience, or even to a whole country	2
16608	3873	What @CAPS9 it that gives a select few the right to ban any given number of imaginative creations, even if they are in some aspects more lued in nature	3
16609	3873	Censorship has and @CAPS9 still a very usefull tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the 'safety' of both our minds and bodies	4
16610	3873	Some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4R, @CAPS3 @LOCATION5, and @LOCATION2	5
16611	3873	In these countries all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the wellfare of the @ORGANIZATION2 are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed	6
16612	3873	The most noteworthy instances of this occured in @LOCATION3, where the @CAPS4 would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies	7
16613	3873	The people were so enthralled by the @CAPS5 leadership that they would often times freely relenquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves	8
16614	3873	The same thing @CAPS9 still occuring in @LOCATION5 today, wtih a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities	9
16615	3873	In @DATE1 the popular search engine @ORGANIZATION3 attempted to set up shop in the country, but quickly entered into dispute with the @ORGANIZATION2 about the censoring of certain materials	10
16616	3873	Some months after the argument began over the censoring of @LOCATION5's people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the @ORGANIZATION2	11
16617	3873	During that time it @CAPS9 reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the @ORGANIZATION2's sanctioned religion	12
16618	3873	But the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship @CAPS9 @LOCATION2, they're @ORGANIZATION2 has restricted and policed any technology in the country	13
16619	3873	The common people live in a so called '@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8'	14
16620	3873	In our home country of the @LOCATION1 we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens	15
16621	3873	We are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both	16
16622	3873	If we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will	17
16623	3873	Are we not a @ORGANIZATION2 for the people, by the people	18
16624	3873	Why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding	19
16625	3873	If we as a people were to allow such a blatent restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place	20
16626	3873	Our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country	21
16627	3873	Are we descendants of those same people	22
16628	3873	If so why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard fought for and earned by our forefathers	23
16629	3873	The censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder '@CAPS9 it really better off this way?'	24
16630	3873	They point out that for every great work of intellegent art, other of a more deviant nature create some more innapropriate pieces of 'art'	25
16631	3873	Pornography @CAPS9 the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the libraries bookshelves but also the provided internet services	26
16632	3873	It @CAPS9 a reasonable question, once that should be take into consideration, but in answer to it I believe that it @CAPS9 and will always be the job of the parent or guardian that bring the child with them	27
16633	3873	It @CAPS9 simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting	28
16634	3873	Helping that child find what they want @CAPS9 a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child	29
16635	3873	And what about those who believe the censor isn't always right about what @CAPS9 and what @CAPS9 not acceptable for the general @ORGANIZATION1	30
16636	3873	As author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none or any other children have taken off the shelf	31
16637	3873	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	32
16638	3873	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     Censorship has been around for a very long time, and will most likely never be fully cut out of any functioning @ORGANIZATION2	33
16639	3873	That @CAPS9 sadly an inevibility that cannot be avoided	34
16640	3873	But the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for.	35
16641	3874	Almost everyone in this world reads	0
16642	3874	Many people have to read almost every day, people @MONTH1 not realize it but they do	1
16643	3874	Reading is just a part of life If you dont know how to read you are most likely to not be sucessful	2
16644	3874	Even if you know how to read a little bit, if you just the knew the basic words people would probally fine but people deffinatly need to know how to read	3
16645	3874	No, I do not think they should take anything off the shelf	4
16646	3874	Why would they take anything off the shelf	5
16647	3874	If anyone finds it offensive they should simally not read it	6
16648	3874	Just because it offends them other people @MONTH1 find it interesting	7
16649	3874	If peolpe just started taking books off the shelf because they were offended by them, who knows how many books we would have left	8
16650	3874	people can  be offended in the most easiest ways	9
16651	3874	We could have no books on the shelf because almost every book out there can offend someone in a way.The same thing with moives, moives can offende people justr the same as books	10
16652	3874	I think moives would offend more than a book would	11
16653	3874	In conclusion, Books, movies or anything of that matter should not be took off the shelf because it offended someone	12
16654	3874	Many people get offended in this word way to easy	13
16655	3874	One person @MONTH1 love a book and another person hate it	14
16656	3874	Just because you hate it does not mean it should be tooken off the shelfs	15
16657	3875	Censorship is one of many important issues facing the world today	0
16658	3875	Many argue that materials considered offensive are damaging to society, and should not be tolerated	1
16659	3875	Others believe that freedom of speech is a universal right that should extend to any and all forms of human expression	2
16660	3875	The issue is further complicated by the concept of what is and is not appropriate for children	3
16661	3875	Are there materials that are acceptable for adults, but not kids	4
16662	3875	Questions such as this have plagued humanity for hundreds of years, and there is no simple solution	5
16663	3875	Today, so many people think of censorship as a bad word	6
16664	3875	In fact, there is nothin inherently wrong with the concept of censorship	7
16665	3875	It is only when people begin to abuse their power and censor materials that should not be censored that problems arise	8
16666	3875	For example, many countries have restrictions on selling and owning copies of '@PERSON2,' the book that @PERSON1 wrote as a sort of mission statement for @LOCATION1	9
16667	3875	While many of the ideas contained within the book are horribly offensive, it still should not be censored	10
16668	3875	People have the right to read the book and form their own opinions on @PERSON1's teachings, it is not the government's place to decide for them	11
16669	3875	While oppressive dictatorship and mass-murder are crimes, reading about them is not	12
16670	3875	There are few materials available that should rightfully be censored and taken out of adult hands	13
16671	3875	If someone understands what they are reading, and are able to form an educated opinion on the material, then nobody has the right to stop them from expanding their knowledge, or expressing themself by creating similar material	14
16672	3875	However, the issue changes completely when one considers children	15
16673	3875	If adults want to view pornography, or read accounts of extreme violence, that is their business	16
16674	3875	However, those concepts are obviously inappropriate for children, and any decent parent wouldn't want their young kids filling their heads with such things	17
16675	3875	Children need to be slowly and gently introduced to these concepts so they can fully understand them	18
16676	3875	In the case of children, careful censorship is necessary for healthy development	19
16677	3875	When it comes to libraries, there are very few materials that should be banned	20
16678	3875	If libraries are meant to be places of learning, then one has no right to limit the information they contain	21
16679	3875	However, that does not mean there should not be any limitations	22
16680	3875	Libraries should offer a children's section, as many do, that would contain materials only appropriate for youngsters	23
16681	3875	Then, it becomes the parents' responsibilty to ensure that their child stays in that section	24
16682	3875	When a parent believes the child is ready to explore the adult section, they are free to take their kid there	25
16683	3875	This system gives parents the ability to keep their children away from harmful material, without taking it out of the hands of adults	26
16684	3875	Many would argue that unsupervised children could gain access to inappropriate material, but that is really an issue that needs to be handled by parents, not the library	27
16685	3875	After all, it's better that a few kids see something they shouldn't have than all adults have to read censored material	28
16686	3875	In conclusion, censorship is a concept that has its place in society, but must be used very carefully	29
16687	3875	When the goal is to protect people, especially children, from harmful material, it can be used sparingly	30
16688	3875	However, when those in power use censorship to attack ideas they disagree with, it becomes a form of oppression	31
16689	3875	Above all else, people must be free to educate themselves, form their own opinions, and express themselves	32
16690	3875	If someone doesn't like a piece of material, they can leave it alone, but they should never try to take it out of someone else's hands	33
16691	3876	Books can make a very deep impression on whoever reads them, and sometimes these impressions are not appropriate for the reader	0
16692	3876	Books that are found inappropriate to children or even teenagers should be reconsidered to be removed off shelves that are exposed to children or teenagers	1
16693	3876	I think that children should not learn inappropriate material if they are not ready to learn about it, in other words if they are not age appropriate	2
16694	3876	Books are just one thing, there are also movies, music, magazines, and etc	3
16695	3876	All of these things can give wrong ideas to our children and teenagers	4
16696	3876	Inappropriate media or imformation should not be exposed to people that are not ready, or mature enough to watch movies, or read books that could harm or give them wrong impressions	5
16697	3876	Children that have read books or watched inappropriate media can sometimes change how they are like	6
16698	3876	I think that many children that watch movies especially that should not be exposed to them	7
16699	3876	Some of the movies that I have seen have been very inapropriate and I could not imagine young children watching these movies	8
16700	3876	This is because I do not think children know as much as we do, so it will give them wrong ideas they have taken the wrong way	9
16701	3876	I think that books or media that is inappropriate can change childrens childhoods in a negative way	10
16702	3876	Children and teenagers should also be mature enough to be exposed to all of the books, movies, and magazines	11
16703	3876	If all the age groups would be exposed to all of the higher rated movies, books, and magazines I dont think that would be very resbonsible on the libraries part, or whoever was exposing it	12
16704	3876	I think that society would be harder to control with this kind of media everywhere	13
16705	3876	Parents would also not appreciate if their children were reading, or seeing something that they think their child should not be exposed to	14
16706	3876	I think that children are simply not mature enough to be exposed to all of the books, magazines, and movies	15
16707	3876	It would cause a lot of problems for many people	16
16708	3876	Many of the children would be doing stupid things that they have seen in a movie or read in a book that they thought was cool, or that they should try it	17
16709	3876	Were are already having a problem with pre-teens or teengers	18
16710	3876	This is because many of them are exposed to things at a early age they should not see, that effect there actions	19
16711	3876	There are many actions I have seen or heard of that relate to a book, or movie that probaly would not have happened if the person was not exposed to it	20
16712	3876	Children simply are not ready, or mature enough to be exposed to everything that books, movies, or magazines have to offer	21
16713	3876	It can change the way that children think, or what they think would be cool to physically do	22
16714	3876	I think that it is bad enough that a lot of teenagers have been exposed to a lot of these things already	23
16715	3876	This should be a wake up call for those who have children	24
16716	3876	Books shold not be exposed to every age group, because it would hurt society and whoever is not ready to learn or witness what they will	25
16717	3877	Censorship has become a major topic when it comes to books, music, and movies	0
16718	3877	These are being censored because people don't want young kids to read, listen, or watch these materials	1
16719	3877	What about the adults	2
16720	3877	Books, music, and movies being taken off of the shelfs in libraries because of censorship, is not fair to the adults	3
16721	3877	Books now are being rewriten so they won't have offevsive language in them	4
16722	3877	To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a classic example of this	5
16723	3877	Changing the offensive language in this book would totally ruin it	6
16724	3877	This book is mainly about the racism that whites had towards the african americans, and if that was altered the readers wouldn't get a sense of that racism	7
16725	3877	If libraries have books that are censored they should put them on a shelf just for censored books so adults could still be able to read them	8
16726	3877	Music is another peice of material that censorship has gotten a hold of	9
16727	3877	Offensive language is being taken out  of songs and uncensored cd's are not being sold in some stores because of censorship	10
16728	3877	Some adults like the original songs with the original words	11
16729	3877	Libraries should carry both the explicit and the clean verions of cd's to they some them that are suitable for kids and the ones that adults can listen to	12
16730	3877	Movies are another peice of material that censorship has taken over	13
16731	3877	They are being rated @CAPS3, suitable for all ages, @NUM1, suitable for children @NUM2 and older, and rated @CAPS4, suitable for people @NUM3 and older	14
16732	3877	These rating are good guidelines, but parents should be the ones to make the final decision on whether or not their child should be able to watch a certain movie	15
16733	3877	Libraries should have all kind of movies on their shelfs	16
16734	3877	If a twelve year old kid wants to watch a @NUM1 or rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian	17
16735	3877	Censoship is a good thing but it doesn't need to be taken to the extreme	18
16736	3877	If an adult wants to read a censored book, he or she should still be able to read it at their local libary and if a young kid wants to watch a rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian.	19
16737	3878	There should not be a certain kinds of books in the library	0
16738	3878	Books should not be tooken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive	1
16739	3878	Do not get the book, other people might like it, its just for entertainment	2
16740	3878	If you do not like the book do not have to get the book	3
16741	3878	While looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past	4
16742	3878	It will not even be a bother	5
16743	3878	There is a lot of books in the library, just find a different book instead of just focusing on that one book	6
16744	3878	There will always be many more books there to look at	7
16745	3878	If there is a bad book just go to a different section in the library	8
16746	3878	There is going to be more good books for a person than bad books	9
16747	3878	If other people would like the book then the library will not take the book off of the shelves	10
16748	3878	It @MONTH1 be offensive to some people but there will be some other people in the world that likes that same book	11
16749	3878	Some people go to the library just to see them kind of books	12
16750	3878	Certain people like certain types of books, maybe it was not the right section for a person to be in	13
16751	3878	The book could be a interesting book all there is to do is try it	14
16752	3878	If anything the reader might even like the book and check it out	15
16753	3878	The books are there for entertainment	16
16754	3878	Thats why they have so much different sections and selections to choose from	17
16755	3878	If an adult does not like a kid book because its giving the kid the wrong idea then do not get the book for the kid	18
16756	3878	A different parent might come in and think that the book will be great for their child though	19
16757	3878	Books should be sat out on the shelf for anybody that goes to the library	20
16758	3878	The librarians will not take books off the shelf for one persons opinion	21
16759	3878	When  all they have to do is do not get the book, think that others might like it, or remember they are there for the readers entertainment.	22
16760	3880	Dear Newspaper:              @CAPS1, there should be censorship in libraries, but people should be a certain age just to check the book out	0
16761	3880	Some people go to the libraries just for censorship	1
16762	3880	These days censorship basicly is how you get children or students just to pick up a book	2
16763	3880	Plus, if the parents aloud their child to read cebsorship books because they think it does no harm to the child which it don't	3
16764	3880	Put a @NUM1 and older section in the libraries so any and every body will not be able to enter unless they have @CAPS2 just to solve the age problem	4
16765	3880	However you do it the libraries will lose the little money they are getting from the people	5
16766	3880	I no you think censorship should be taking off every shelf in the libraries, but they really shouldn't because I believe if you do that then the libraries will go out of business for good	6
16767	3880	That is the reason why the libraries should keep censorship on there selvies	7
16768	3880	I'm finish but I will leave you with this question: do you really want to take censorship out the libraries?	8
16769	3881	Now take a moment and go back to highschool	0
16770	3881	Do you remember roaming under the opera house with the phantom	1
16771	3881	What about fighting for @PERSON2's freedom with @PERSON1	2
16772	3881	Perhaps getting people into trouble in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1	3
16773	3881	No matter what your favorite classic piece of literature was, you recall the wonderful feeling you felt when reading it	4
16774	3881	It enveloped you into its world, and you felt every sensation it offered	5
16775	3881	What is this though	6
16776	3881	The author is a @CAPS2	7
16777	3881	The author uses occassional bad words	8
16778	3881	The author is a woman	9
16779	3881	This is not an acceptable excuse to miss out on everything literature offers	10
16780	3881	Censorship in pulic libraries is wrong	11
16781	3881	The @CAPS3 was a dark time	12
16782	3881	Thousands upon thousands of @CAPS4 people were killed for their religious belief, as well as homosexual people, and other minorities	13
16783	3881	Amidst all of this chaos, the @ORGANIZATION1 decided it would be a good idea to burn all books written by @CAPS4 authors	14
16784	3881	So they did	15
16785	3881	Millions of books were eradicated along with their owners all because of a religious difference	16
16786	3881	Does it even need to be asked	17
16787	3881	This was wrong	18
16788	3881	Many say that ignorance is bliss, but is it really when people impose their ideas on others	19
16789	3881	Let us now look now at what a book, movie, magazine, or song offends with to be censored	20
16790	3881	A curse word, a bit of skin, a controversial idea	21
16791	3881	Sometimes these are needed for emphasis of the compilation	22
16792	3881	Imagine how much less forceful an angry character would be without a few curses every now and then	23
16793	3881	Pathetic	24
16794	3881	So is it worth it to you	25
16795	3881	Will you give up a beautiful composition because it is controversial	26
16796	3881	Will you hide your children from materials that will make them form their own opinions	27
16797	3881	One thing is certain, I will not	28
16798	3881	I will stand against censorship until it has felt the mighty blow that it has inflicted on so many beautiful works	29
16799	3881	One day my plea will be heard	30
16800	3881	Censorship in public libraries is wrong no matter how you put it	31
16801	3882	There are a bunch of very good book sat a public libary, you can get all kinds of different types of books	0
16802	3882	You are get a book on anything you really need, any facts you need to know or anything you want to know how to do, I'm sure there is a book out there that can help you out	1
16803	3882	Just because a book is an opion dont mean it needs to be taking off shelves	2
16804	3882	Everone looks at everything differently	3
16805	3882	If you read it can help you in many different ways, you can learn alot just from reading a book	4
16806	3882	Me personally i hate reading, so i dont learn much	5
16807	3882	I'm more of a hands on type of person, words just fly through one ear and out the other really	6
16808	3882	It is really have to understand when im trying to read and listen or write an listen i lose my thoughts to easily	7
16809	3884	I do belive in censorship, but i do belive that it is not that big of a deal	0
16810	3884	It should the parants job to block materials that they think is bad for their kids	1
16811	3884	If it is to bad then it is the parants right to make sure that their kid does not see it	2
16812	3884	My point of view in stoping materials like books, music, movies, and magazines is that some things are not ment to be shown, read, and heard by someone of a yonger age unless they get the ok from their parents	3
16813	3884	The views of censorship in my mind is that if someone see something they don't like they want to get rid of it and if is something to wrong then yes it should be censor, but if it could be avoided and is small like a word in a book then I say that people should be a little more understanding of it and try to think past it or try to find another path to take about it	4
16814	3884	If you don't like something then maybe you should not read it or listen to it, and if is so bad don't let your kids get involved in it	5
16815	3884	I have never found a book and readed it and found it affensive or disterbing	6
16816	3884	I have found books that I don't like or are not good but never have I seen something so bad that I never want any one to read it	7
16817	3884	If people are going to censor something I think it should be for a good reason not because they don't like the person or they think their idea is wrong, but for something that is bad about anetirer race or to graphic for a yonge age	8
16818	3884	My point in censoring something in my mind is the right way to look at it we see it all the time in the real world people do something because they dont like some one they try some extreame things to get rid of some bad marerial, but in any case is a lot in this world that people should know about and when i do have kids I will decide wether to block something if I wont to and that is how it should be	9
16819	3885	If I was givin the chance to choose if people should take books off of shelves or not that offend people at local libraries, I would think neither taking the books off the shelf, nor leaving them on @CAPS1 are quite correct	0
16820	3885	I would defiently reccomend a voting to take place, in order to figure out what to do with the books	1
16821	3885	I would say a vote would be reasonable because many people have many different beliefs, in which some could be offended	2
16822	3885	So I would take at least ten different people with different religions,backgrounds, and so forth, and I would have them all vote on which they thought they should do with the offensive books	3
16823	3885	People believe differently, so it would be hard to please them all	4
16824	3885	That's why a vote with different types of people would be effective for almost anyone	5
16825	3885	Just like my mom said, 'you will never make everyone happy.'  @CAPS1 are so many things out in the society today that can offend people, and what might majorly offend one, might have no effect on the other	6
16826	3885	This is the main reason voting is rough, because @CAPS1's a wide variety of people on earth today	7
16827	3885	You would have to probably also look at how many times the book has been checked out before, because @CAPS1 is a possibility that no one in the voting group has the same opinion as those who have checked it out before	8
16828	3885	Although if the book is voted to stay in the library, I believe the book should be labeled in the correct area	9
16829	3885	Due to the fact that the book could be offending to some people, should be labeled incase someone who doesn't know, like a child, comes upon that book	10
16830	3885	Voting is used in our society today and has been very effective for many years now	11
16831	3885	Voting doesn't only have to be used during an election, but also can be used for this reason as well	12
16832	3885	Voting is always important and people should notice that	13
16833	3885	I believe that voting could be the answer to many problems in  the world today	14
16834	3886	When ever has a few bad things being said ever effected how or what people read @CAPS2 a days	0
16835	3886	That's what is hot in this present lifetime	1
16836	3886	No one wants to read a boring article, not unless it's meant to be	2
16837	3886	I'm going to share with you my opinions on certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, ect.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	3
16838	3886	I have observations, experience, and reading some of my the articles that were called offensive to prove my opinions	4
16839	3886	In my opinion, no ones work should be taken off of a shelf due to any thing, because I'm sure they worked on it an awful lot for it to be placed on a shelf	5
16840	3886	So there is no reason for it to be taken off	6
16841	3886	If that was my stuff that had got took off the shelves I would be shocked and upset	7
16842	3886	So that is one reason why you shouldn't do that	8
16843	3886	It could hurt people emotionly	9
16844	3886	Following that statement, but there can be times where you just don't want them to be seen because they are to embarrassing	10
16845	3886	Such as an athlete interviewed in an @CAPS1 article, that got suspended from their sport due to violations, and this athlete is just cursing and being out of control	11
16846	3886	I would put that article away also, just so the public won't see it and no one is put on blast	12
16847	3886	Finally, @CAPS2 everyone knows that some types of movies, and music can't be put on display in public	13
16848	3886	So you would have to ask for the movie or @CAPS3 and someone will go get it from the back for you, due to explicit content or explicit lyrics	14
16849	3886	G-@CAPS4 @NUM1, should be the only movies allowed on shelves, rated @CAPS5 and up should be behind counter, and the same with music	15
16850	3886	I am pretty sure that is clear with this audience	16
16851	3886	@CAPS2 that I have shared with you my opinions on different views on censorship in libbraries what is you thoughts on this topic as you read this persuasive essay	17
16852	3886	You have read my thoughts on experience, observations, and just common sense on this topice	18
16853	3886	If you had to write an essay on censorship in libraries, how would you come about this.	19
16854	3887	Materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines are used for peoples enjoyment	0
16855	3887	Adults and kids get a lot of information out of the libraries reading materials	1
16856	3887	Books give  people another way to learn new things, instead of in a class	2
16857	3887	If the reading materials are already in the classroom they should not be removed	3
16858	3887	If someone is walking into a library, they have to be responsible	4
16859	3887	Adults along with young adults have to know what they should read and whats not acceptable	5
16860	3887	No one has the right to take a book off of the shelf, because they think its offensive	6
16861	3887	There are millions of book in the world that people find offensive	7
16862	3887	Theres not one perfect book in this world that doesn't bother somebody	8
16863	3887	Every single book that is made today has a right to be read	9
16864	3887	Theres people out in the world looking for a certain book, magazine, movie, and even music	10
16865	3887	That material is hepling find the answer to a problem, giving the right decision, and helping someone walk in the right path	11
16866	3887	The @CAPS1 is a book of understanding and knowledge	12
16867	3887	There are a good number of people how think we shouldn't read it, or even pick it up	13
16868	3887	Like the @CAPS1 say, free will	14
16869	3887	It's our free will to pick up books we want to read	15
16870	3887	Books give people another way to learn new things	16
16871	3887	Adults and kids get a lot of information out of the libaries reading materials	17
16872	3887	Books, music, movies, and magazines are used for people's enjoyment	18
16873	3888	Should offenive material be censored	0
16874	3888	No, censoring books, music, movies, magazines, etc	1
16875	3888	takes away from our freedom as an american citizen	2
16876	3888	If you think books should be censored, then think about this	3
16877	3888	Would they take 'hell' or 'damned' out of the bible because those words are considered offensive	4
16878	3888	I do not think so, those words give power to the book	5
16879	3888	@CAPS1 books, considered offensive, are an insigh to history and culture	6
16880	3888	Taking away these books will limit education	7
16881	3888	Books should not be censored	8
16882	3888	I very resent and much talked about case of censorship is the popular book '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1.'  The book tells the story of a young white boy running off with an older black man	9
16883	3888	In the story, the word 'nigger' is used frequently	10
16884	3888	A lot of people were offended by the using of this word, so they republished a new version of the book, replacing 'nigger' with 'slave.'  @CAPS1 people were happy with the word change, but others felt that by censoring the word they were taking away a very vital part of the story	11
16885	3888	I agree with the latter statement	12
16886	3888	The story's setting was back when black people were slaves and known as niggers	13
16887	3888	I agree that the word nigger carries a heavy connotaion, but that is the purpose of using the word	14
16888	3888	The author used it so that the reader could get a feel for what life was like back then	15
16889	3888	When thinking about the coming generations, who will not know about slavery or black oppression, the book gives a raw insight into how life was for a black man	16
16890	3888	The word itself is a symbolism of slavery, without it, the book is not as powerful	17
16891	3888	Censorship is a fine line, and everybody has a different place where they draw that line	18
16892	3888	The story of @ORGANIZATION1 is just one example of censorship	19
16893	3888	On television, nudity and language is censored when dubbed inappropriate	20
16894	3888	It should be up to the parent to decide which books there child should read, which magazines they should buy, and which television programs they should watch	21
16895	3888	If the parent sees the book as offensive or think that there child should not read it, then they should be the ones who makes sure their child does not read it	22
16896	3888	The books should not be taken of the shelf because they will entertain and educate other children or parents	23
16897	3888	Books should not be censored, if a person does not think the book is appropriate, then they do not have to read it.	24
16898	3889	Imagine @CAPS1, you are in the library looking for a book to read, to when your son or daughter runs up to you holding a magazine of questionable nature	0
16899	3889	What do you do	1
16900	3889	A library should not have inapporiate items on the shelves	2
16901	3889	Censoring libraries is something to protect you and your family	3
16902	3889	Libraries should be censored so that way everyone can enjoy themselves	4
16903	3889	The first reason I thing that libraries should be censored is because of the children that go there	5
16904	3889	Children are curious and they are always attracted to things that are colorful and different	6
16905	3889	An example I have of @CAPS1 is my baby sister	7
16906	3889	She wanted to go to the zoo instead of the museum because as she said 'I want to see the animals, not a boring statue	8
16907	3889	I can see those anytime around town.' @CAPS1 is showing that children want to see different things and if they were to go to the library and see the same items then there is not anything to worry about	9
16908	3889	The first time they see something of questionable nature they would want it because it is new	10
16909	3889	The second reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes not all of the items in the library are put in the right place	11
16910	3889	Say that you wanted to watch a movie that sounded really good and you checked it out at the library, went home, put it in, and find out it is not the movie you thought it was	12
16911	3889	What if you rented that movie for a party and had guests over	13
16912	3889	Would that not embarrass you	14
16913	3889	Well something like that happened to my cousin but she got a @LOCATION1	15
16914	3889	She was embarrassed for weeks after it happened	16
16915	3889	All of that embarrassment could have been prevented if the libraries had to be censored	17
16916	3889	The third reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes seeing certain material in a library can be rather offensive	18
16917	3889	Would you be offended by seeing something like that	19
16918	3889	I know that I would	20
16919	3889	I would not want anyone to be offended like that	21
16920	3889	When I was little I went to the mall with my grandmother	22
16921	3889	We were trying to buy a new pair of jeans for me	23
16922	3889	I got offended when the salesperson said that I 'looked fat' in the jeans I had picked	24
16923	3889	I know what it is like to be offended and people should take other peoples' feeling into account before they offend	25
16924	3889	While some people thing that inapporite material is fine to have in a library I believe that they should find other places for it	26
16925	3889	Think of your family and how much you love them	27
16926	3889	Think of what not having  a censor on the libraries can cause	28
16927	3889	Do you want to be responsible for not doing anything to help	29
16928	3889	Try to find ways to get stricter laws on censoring libraries	30
16929	3890	Why should books that some people enjoy to read be removed off of library shelves	0
16930	3890	That is ludacris	1
16931	3890	There are so many alternatives then to just take those certain books off the shelves completely	2
16932	3890	We all have seen or heard of books that are inapropriate to certain audiences	3
16933	3890	It is understandable that young children should not read or be associated with these kind of materials such as: books, magazines, poems, movies, songs	4
16934	3890	It is totally unnecessary for children to be reading such explicit material, but it is possible for us to prevent it	5
16935	3890	One way libraries throughout the nation can prevent this is by making a complete different libraries or have the explicit materials be located in the total opposite side of the library from the children's materials	6
16936	3890	I know that libraries tend to have opposite corners of the library dedicated to adult materials and childrens materials, but there should be more strict rules of kids being in the adult section	7
16937	3890	Another idea is to have parental permission on the child's own library card telling the librarian, when the child checks out a book, where in the library they can get a book	8
16938	3890	For example maybe the childs' parents only will allow him/her to get materials from the children's section in the library	9
16939	3890	therefore if that child wants a material from a different area of the library they cannot get it, unless his/her parents are their telling the librarian the child is allowed to get it	10
16940	3890	I know when i was a child and i couldn't do something that my parents were doing, it made me feel upset, but now that i look back i realize why they wanted me not to do what they were doing	11
16941	3890	They wanted me to be a child as long as possble	12
16942	3890	They knew if i was reading or listening inapropriate materials then i was growing up way too fast	13
16943	3890	I know that now and understand it now what they wanted for me	14
16944	3890	To conclude, lets keep those filthy books and magazines away from the younger kids	15
16945	3890	I don't want to see it get banned from the libraries or taken out of libraries	16
16946	3890	I just want to see parents stepping up to be parents and not letting their young children be exposed to that kind of thing	17
16947	3890	It isn't the libraries faults if people's children are being exposed to this explicit material	18
16948	3890	it's the parent's fault for letting it happen	19
16949	3891	Should materials that are offensive be taken off shelves?Should movies you loved and use to watch when you were a kid be gone in a instant	0
16950	3891	Magazines are offensive, they always have been, they get the truth out of celebrities and people and they twist their words into something totally different from what they said	1
16951	3891	There are tons of movies in this world that will show harm to people, replay a bad part of somebodys life, say things about people.Music is just words and sound, they make songs about people that have done stuff in the past , that people would find offensive	2
16952	3891	I have seen a music video about @PERSON1 and making fun of her being in jail, but do i think that should be taken off the computer, no its entertaining.This world needs something to keep us intertained	3
16953	3891	Imagine what it would be like if we had no news reporters, no paparazzi	4
16954	3891	We wouldnt know anything going on around the world, and seeing the things about celebrities that they would find offensive, i can understand where they are coming from, getting talked about all the time, especialy about mistakes you have made in your lives, but thats how the world functions, thats always going to be apart of everyones lives,talk	5
16955	3891	So as i have been saying, getting rid of movies,music,magazines,books that are offensive would not be a good choice in my opinion, cause what would entertain us if they were gone?	6
16956	3892	Here in @LOCATION1, it is in our constitution that says anyone can have freedom of speech	0
16957	3892	Freedom to say anything they wish to get off their mind and express individuality and opinions	1
16958	3892	This should also include books, music, movies, magazines, and any other form of entertainment	2
16959	3892	However, there will always be people that could take offense to others' ideas and opinions that comes with freedom of speech	3
16960	3892	In a case where someone was to find a certain type of material to be offensive at a public library, then it should be known that he or she should not observe the type of material given	4
16961	3892	He or she should not throw a tantrum over something that they find offensive while other people find very enjoyable	5
16962	3892	It is in that person's standpoint that they should realize and come to grips with freedom of speech	6
16963	3892	What they @MONTH1 not like could very be what others do like	7
16964	3892	So, why should other peoples' form of enjoyment be censored and taken away from them just because of one bad lemon	8
16965	3892	It shouldn't	9
16966	3892	Everyone expresses themselves in their own way	10
16967	3892	It's a form of getting positive and/or negative energy out in a healthy way	11
16968	3892	Whether it's writing books, posting articles, or writing music, it's a way to vent and some people @MONTH1 like that venting person's style	12
16969	3892	It is completely up to that person who takes offense to materials on whether or not to observe such style	13
16970	3892	Censorship should not be allowed in libraries	14
16971	3892	If there was a type of censorship, it would be taking away what some person would like to enjoy	15
16972	3892	It would also be taking away the artists' or authors' freedom of speech and expression	16
16973	3892	There are books that were banned from schools throughout the country	17
16974	3892	Just because they think is right doesn't always mean it is right	18
16975	3892	Sure, they just want the people protected from certain offensive stuff	19
16976	3892	but why keep them from the real world	20
16977	3892	Let people out to see what this world is like and it's various types of art.	21
16978	3893	Censorship for books	0
16979	3893	Never thought I'd see the day	1
16980	3893	But, that doesn't necessarily mean I approve or agree	2
16981	3893	Just because I don't approve or agree doesn't mean I do not oppose it	3
16982	3893	I find that need taking a step back and arguing both sides is sufficient and fair	4
16983	3893	Shall we	5
16984	3893	Among others, I find that if you censor one thing, you censor them all	6
16985	3893	Public items such as televisions, radios, magazines, and even books have wriggled their way into our not so perfect world	7
16986	3893	Yes, there are crimes and indecencies happening as you read this	8
16987	3893	But, is it entirely fair to say that these public items have completely influenced and brainwashed children into early adulthood	9
16988	3893	Maybe	10
16989	3893	Then again, maybe not	11
16990	3893	It is true that children, at their youngest, are easily molded and cut out into who they will permenantly be, or at least until they're old enough to form their own opinions on certain topics.For instance, when I was younger, my cousin, who happens to be just a few years older than me, started to like a certain thing	12
16991	3893	After spending time with her for an elongated amount of time, I started to 'like' it too	13
16992	3893	I found myself obsessed with it	14
16993	3893	Now, before you start getting it into your mind that it was something bad, I can assure you, it was nothing other than stacks of @CAPS1 cards	15
16994	3893	Anyway, it wasn't until later that my mother informed me that it wasn't really my interest	16
16995	3893	It was hers	17
16996	3893	I modeled after her likes and dislikes	18
16997	3893	Every other child in the world has done something similar	19
16998	3893	What makes anybody think they wouldn't do the exact same after listening to uncensored music, watching uncensored television, or reading an uncensored book or magazine	20
16999	3893	On the other hand, it would be unfair to take away some books that people find to be improper or indecent	21
17000	3893	If that were the case, nearly every book would be out of sight, but not out of mind	22
17001	3893	Today, you can't turn on the radio without hearing something about sex, drugs, alcohol, or smoking	23
17002	3893	Now, those things are a lot more accessable to anybody	24
17003	3893	You can't turn on the computer without advertisements for porn or other sexually crude websites popping up on your screen	25
17004	3893	Books have gotten out of hand, as well	26
17005	3893	The world nowadays has gotten ridiculous and out of place	27
17006	3893	But in the end, I'm sticking to my original opinion: If you censor one thing, censor them all	28
17007	3893	It's only fair	29
17008	3893	Radios, television, movies, and even @CAPS2's have been censored	30
17009	3893	Books are not as innocent as they seem, anymore	31
17010	3893	So yes, my final opinion is that libraries should, in fact, censor their books, or at least make an effort to	32
17011	3893	Libraries are places to learn and have fun doing so, not have a mental scar leading back to what they read in a 'harmless' little book.	33
17012	3894	You are not elgible to check out this book', says the libranian	0
17013	3894	You are just too young for this book	1
17014	3894	To me censorship laws in libraries are not needed	2
17015	3894	The common people should have the liberty to check out what ever they please	3
17016	3894	The people who make the censorship laws should be pleased that young people actually want to read	4
17017	3894	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are all under censorship	5
17018	3894	Everyonee takes things in differently, being said some are mature than others	6
17019	3894	If they want to play that game, or read that book they should be allowed	7
17020	3894	The person who picks up the product should know how they are and should know if they can handle the material	8
17021	3894	Therefore they are held accountable for their actions	9
17022	3894	Isnt that how legal laws are carried out	10
17023	3894	If any sort of content is found offensive it still shouldnt be removed from the shelves	11
17024	3894	Something @MONTH1 seem offensive to one person but someone else @MONTH1 find that interesting	12
17025	3894	For example, when the newspaper talks about a specific athlete they @MONTH1 say things tha offends his?her fans	13
17026	3894	They people who are not fans of him/her @MONTH1 find it ammusing	14
17027	3894	so they should remove the post because some people dont like it	15
17028	3894	Someone @MONTH1 like that book, music, movie, or magazine dont inconvience them because of a few people	16
17029	3894	Interest @MONTH1 vary, but a teen @MONTH1 like the same type of books as an adult	17
17030	3894	Censorship laws wont  let the teen read the book they likes because of his/her age, and to me that is unfair	18
17031	3894	It is a new day and age	19
17032	3894	things have changed from what they once were	20
17033	3894	Cencorship laws should be wiped out completly	21
17034	3894	If you @MONTH1 find a book offensive in any way, shape, or form just dont read it	22
17035	3894	Nobody is forcing to read that specific book	23
17036	3894	libraries are filled up with a numerous amount of books	24
17037	3894	There is a book out there that you will enjoy	25
17038	3894	In conclusion, certain material shouldnt be removed from shelves if found offensive	26
17039	3894	Some other peoople @MONTH1 like that same aterial	27
17040	3894	There shouldnt be censorship laws in libraries at all	28
17041	3894	That is just unfair, and unjust to some people	29
17042	3894	Its a new time and age and things are different	30
17043	3894	People of any age should be able to check out any book they please	31
17044	3895	The things we find in libararies shouldn't be offensive to anybody	0
17045	3895	It's the choice you make rather you won't to read it or not	1
17046	3895	Nobody is making look at those things if you don't want to	2
17047	3895	Don't look at it, if you think it's offensive	3
17048	3895	The best thing to do is to keep it on the shelves	4
17049	3895	Some people like looking or reading things like that	5
17050	3895	People don't go to the library and pick up a book or a movie that they know they wouldn't like	6
17051	3895	If that was to happen, then there wouldn't be any library around because anything you get from the library, I bet you can find something offensive about it	7
17052	3895	People find stuff like that entertaning when watch or read stuff like that	8
17053	3895	That hurt the people that make the books and movies that are offensive because they feel like thats what people wan't to see	9
17054	3895	True enough thats what people won't see as long as it's not effecting them in no kind of way	10
17055	3895	That what we see on a daily basic on tv is offensive things, so if we can sit there and watch it on tv then we shouldn't have on problem reading or watching a book about it	11
17056	3895	I see stuff offensive on tv about everyday, but it doesn't bother me so reading a book or anything else like that, I woudn't care because i'm use to seeing it on tv	12
17057	3895	Nobody can make read or stop reading things like that, only you can	13
17058	3895	You don't have to look at it if you think its offensive	14
17059	3895	It shouldn't be a problem with anyone because thats what we hear and see everyday	15
17060	3895	No matter what some people find that entertaning.	16
17061	3896	What is censorship	0
17062	3896	Censorship is editing or just plain getting rid of	1
17063	3896	Censorship can be a good thing it could also be a bad thing	2
17064	3896	Does censorship really help in our society	3
17065	3896	Actually think about it, there is still murders, rapes, and whatever else with censory	4
17066	3896	How I would argue with this, is by listing my own experiences, observations, and readings	5
17067	3896	Firstly, my experiences would have to be about movies and/or television shows	6
17068	3896	In some movies you get to choose on what you want to watch	7
17069	3896	The unrated version or the censored version	8
17070	3896	Well, most people want to watch the unrated version, beacuse it's more than likely more funny and shows more	9
17071	3896	Other people might choose the censored version, because of the fact that they have children and dont want them watching stuff that would be in the unrated version	10
17072	3896	I would perferably pick the unrated version, because i like all the funny parts that wouldn't show in the censored version	11
17073	3896	Then there are those television shows that 'bleep' out alot of words, because of course you are not allowed to say them on television	12
17074	3896	Parents dont want their six year old going around and saying all of them nasty words	13
17075	3896	That's why most of the time you hardly ever see them kind of shows on in the afternoons, they are usually on at @TIME1 or later	14
17076	3896	Secondly, my observations about movies and/or television shows	15
17077	3896	I cant say that I dont watch shows that have some language in them nor can I say that I dont watch shows that are all bloody and gory	16
17078	3896	I do watch them, but i would never watch them around my younger sister	17
17079	3896	She is eleven years old, I dont want my littel sister going to school and saying a bad word and have a teacher hear her	18
17080	3896	Then she would say well @PERSON1 was the one who watched the movie	19
17081	3896	I would also never ever watch a bloody, gory, and really graphic movie in front of her either	20
17082	3896	Some movies could do without so much violence, but they have to make money some how	21
17083	3896	Right	22
17084	3896	Last but not least, my readings about, lets say books and/or music lyrics	23
17085	3896	So many books have been banned across the @LOCATION1, because people were offended by them or just didnt want that book on the shelves just in case their child reads it	24
17086	3896	Some songs cant be played on the radio, because of some of the stories behind the music and/or the words in and through out the song	25
17087	3896	That's why the artist of the song has to make two different copies of their song, so they can be played and so they will get popular	26
17088	3896	I have read books that do have some words in them, but they are also my grade level and I'm pretty sure most people are more mature than they were	27
17089	3896	When I see a word that isn't the nicest word ever, I keep reading and dont let it bother me	28
17090	3896	Same with songs, the artist probably has a reason why he/she uses the words they use	29
17091	3896	Censorship can be good or bad, it really depends on how you look at things	30
17092	3896	Honestly, I have no objections to censorship and other times I do	31
17093	3896	My experiences, observations, and/or reading has made me think about how censorship could be bad or good.	32
17094	3897	I believe that if you find a book offensive then you should not read that book	0
17095	3897	What some people find as offensive some other people might find it not offensive	1
17096	3897	I do not think that people should not be able to take books off of the shelves	2
17097	3897	For example if there is a person of the jewish religion they might find a book about hitler offensive	3
17098	3897	In that sense if they take the book off of the shelf then the other kids that are soon to come into the age of studying this era will not have a book to look at	4
17099	3897	Without these books our history of the world will be soon forgotten	5
17100	3897	Another example would be slavery	6
17101	3897	I believe that slavery is a hard subject to come to grips with	7
17102	3897	In the reality it was a hard time for the africans	8
17103	3897	I do not think that they will take the books off of the shelf because of it being offensive	9
17104	3897	How could you take away the future of learning from the children that are our next generation	10
17105	3897	If we are to take the books off of the shelves at the libraries what do we do about the bible	11
17106	3897	Some people do not believe that there is a god or a heaven, but a lot of other people do believe in it	12
17107	3897	So how would that work out in the long run	13
17108	3897	it would create a lot of problems for the public library and for its citizens as well	14
17109	3897	In reading books as a kid i have found that some things are bad and i do not like them, but i dont believe that we should take the book away from people that like the books.How do you take away from the people that like to read different nopvels than you is beyond me, but it will only be a problematic subject in the future	15
17110	3897	this is an essay by @PERSON1	16
17111	3898	Older authors love to write grusome stories about their pasts, whether it's fiction or nonfiction	0
17112	3898	Sometimes those books can get into the wrong hands and end up in the trash or burned	1
17113	3898	Other times parents get angry at what they're children are doing and saying, and they normally blame television or other kids at school	2
17114	3898	Parents don't always look at the big picture	3
17115	3898	Any child at anytime can walk right into their school or public library and pick up an inappropriate magazine,book, or movie, but parents don't usually catch on until it's too late	4
17116	3898	There are all kinds of books out there and no two books are the same	5
17117	3898	Nobody can tell a book is going to be inappropriate just by looking at the front cover	6
17118	3898	Even though books are meant to be read, it doesn't mean they should be read by all age groups	7
17119	3898	No book at any point in time should be completely removed from a library, that's just not right	8
17120	3898	No matter how graphic, perverted, or inapproriate a book can get, it should never be thrown away	9
17121	3898	Those certain books are written for people with those kinds of interests	10
17122	3898	Even books about drugs should be allowed to be read, some children or adults could be interested in what they really do do to your body and mind, and they'd rather read a book about it rather than trying it themselves	11
17123	3898	Books about murder should also be allowed to be read, but not by children under twelve	12
17124	3898	If people in libraries would just start putting books in organized age groups then there probably wouldn't be any problems	13
17125	3898	The author should never be blamed for something they wrote	14
17126	3898	It's their own personal thoughts and feelings and most of all it's their story	15
17127	3898	It's how they wanted it to be written and nobody should get mad over that	16
17128	3898	The rule should apply for magazines, music, and movies	17
17129	3898	Those people wrote the books, movies, magazines, and music so it should be expressed the way they wanted it to be	18
17130	3898	Even if the authors themselves thought their own writing was too bad for a child to read, or hear they would make it clear by putting something like, 'not for children under the age of twelve or whatever age they recommend.'     If adults are really getting mad about this then they need to look back at the kinds of things they were doing, saying, or reading and maybe it would change their outlook a little on movies, magazines, music, and books.	19
17131	3899	Walking in to the library and looking for a good book or magazine to read, you run into some of those disgusting books that are offensive to some people	0
17132	3899	Some people think they should be removed from the shelves, and I am one of them	1
17133	3899	Are you	2
17134	3899	There are some books, magazines, movies, and ect., that we all run into that have very bad language, racism, bad religious talking, and even some about sex	3
17135	3899	Nobody needs to be reading those kind of books, it is bad for our minds and is very offensive to some people	4
17136	3899	A lot of people do not like to hear curse words or see them	5
17137	3899	Seeing those words in a book will make that person think wrong things about the library and put the wrong words in their head	6
17138	3899	Then there are those books about racism and that is the worst topic to most people	7
17139	3899	If someone came across that in a book, it would hurt their feelings and they would not want to finish that book	8
17140	3899	Their are others that are very religious and if they come across something that is wrong about their religion the will be very offended	9
17141	3899	There are a few ways that the library could handle the books that offend people	10
17142	3899	The librarian could think about putting a warning sign up and seperating those books, magazines, and etc., into their own section for people that do get offended by those things know where they are and know not to look there	11
17143	3899	Or inside the front cover the librarian could put a warning note on there to show the person that there are some things in there that @MONTH1 offend someone	12
17144	3899	It would be very helpful to so many people	13
17145	3899	In every library you won't see that all the books are perfectly good	14
17146	3899	We all know that there are going to be some bad things in books, but there are some books that are way too inapropriate and those books can be removed	15
17147	3899	There are just way too many people that get offended while reading the books they want to read	16
17148	3899	Let's put a stop to it	17
17149	3899	In conclusion, many of the libraries around are going to have the kind of books that offend some people	18
17150	3899	There can be a stop to that by removing them from the shelves or at least warning others about the things in the books, magazines, and all the other entertainment people like these days	19
17151	3899	It would be amazing to know that all the people that love to read will not be offended by what they are reading!	20
17152	3900	I believe that there are certain movies, music, and other things that are bothering parents	0
17153	3900	I would not whant my kid listening to music that has a lot of things that can teach you wether if its write or wrong, I would check the kind of music my child listens to to see if they are bieng tought bad things	1
17154	3900	I believe that there are some movies that are to violent for anyone to see, but this is a free country which us regular average people will watch any way	2
17155	3900	There are movies made for adults, but how many adults let their kids watch them to	3
17156	3900	No matter what they make there will be people who dont like what they see or they know somebody who didnt like what they saw.Some times there are people that dont like what they hear, or knows somebody who didnt like what they hear'd in music or on the television	4
17157	3900	There are times my mom here's something on t.v or music and said turn that of	5
17158	3900	my friends all listen to this music that i dont think amounts to nothing but the production of inmates, and other wrong doings such as, gangs, fights, shootings, and jurry trials	6
17159	3900	there are things on the market that has an error of a certain group who might like action movies	7
17160	3900	Well there are kids out there learning those things they saw, and they are trying to do what they saw, becuase they think that it will make them look cool	8
17161	3900	There will always be things that peolpe do not like and will never like	9
17162	3900	I learned that when I was young, just like most young kids have	10
17163	3900	I think the biggest thing that sell's, is the dramma, action movies, and the stuff that parents will like	11
17164	3900	Very little of baby movies, and baby music	12
17165	3900	But what can you do about that	13
17166	3900	I like most of what I hear, and see	14
17167	3900	I have always thought there was a lot of violence, and picture shots, and things about drugs that just should not be on national television to teach the young.This is what I think.	15
17168	3901	Human beings, like snowflakes, are very much alike in a unique way	0
17169	3901	Just as there are no two identical snowflakes, no two humans are exactly the same	1
17170	3901	As everyone has their differences, there are always those who have a greater sense of curiousity, and prefer to think outside the box	2
17171	3901	However, it is difficult for these curious people to extend their strive for knowledge, if they have restrictions as to what they can read or study	3
17172	3901	Therefore, if a person is mature enough, and desires to study or read upon a certain topic at a library, they should be allowed to extend their knowledge on any topic of their choosing, with permission of a gaurdian of course	4
17173	3901	Unfortunately, it is often times a group of minorities that ruin something for the greater minority	5
17174	3901	Libraries often times take in account a child's age as a factor towards what a they can, and can not read, but age seems completely unfair to a child who is mature enough to read, and handle the more adult rated intell in a fashionable manner	6
17175	3901	If one is legally eligable, and they have permission from their gaurdian, then he or she should have no restrictions to the materials provided at any library what-so-ever	7
17176	3901	Who is one to say a ten-year-old is too young to learn about @PERSON1 and his horrible plans for the @CAPS1	8
17177	3901	A person is never too young, or too old to learn something new, if the curiousity and the proper level of maturity is present	9
17178	3901	It is curiousity that has led mankind to discover something new each and every day	10
17179	3901	As well, it is curiousity that has brought mankind to the extraordinary level of technology, and inventions that it is at today	11
17180	3901	The youth of the present will one day be the engineers, doctors, scientists, and moving leaders of the future	12
17181	3901	If these young people are curious, and desire to achieve greater knowledge on a certain topic for positive reasons, then let them be!	13
17182	3902	In most libraries in the @LOCATION1, there are certain books, movies, music, etc., that could be inappropriate to younger children	0
17183	3902	These books and movies can contain graphic content or offensive language that any young child should not be hearing or seeing	1
17184	3902	However, this does not mean that the libraries of @LOCATION2 should get rid of these books, videos, etc	2
17185	3902	The libraries should keep these books and videos because the adults of @LOCATION2 like to use them, the kids probably already know about the language and graphic content, and some of the books and movies that are offensive are very educational	3
17186	3902	When you think about your childhood, there would always be things you couldn't watch or listen to because you were to young	4
17187	3902	Your @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 would watch movies that you couldn't watch because they would say you aren't old enough	5
17188	3902	They enjoy watching more mature movies because it is more interesting to them than cartoon shows or movies	6
17189	3902	The mature content in movies, books, and more should be kept in libraries because mature audiences enjoy watching and listening to them	7
17190	3902	If they are taken out of libraries, this mature audience has nothing to watch or read in the library	8
17191	3902	They do not want to be reading children's books all the time	9
17192	3902	Also, most children have already observed or heard this offensive content in these books and movies	10
17193	3902	Most of the parents in the @LOCATION1 have used offensive language infront of their child without even realizing it	11
17194	3902	The kid then starts using these words because they think they are cool if @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 use them	12
17195	3902	Another thing is that most kids have seen a movie with graphic content in it, or they have played a video game with it in the game	13
17196	3902	They have seen blood, gore, and other things in these games and movies	14
17197	3902	It's already too late to try and hide your child from seeing or hearing these 'bad words' or 'graphic content'	15
17198	3902	Many movies and books that contain offensive language and graphic content are very good and educational videos	16
17199	3902	For example, '@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5' was a great movie describing the search for one man in the middle of @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1	17
17200	3902	These wars actually occured and movies like this give a great amount of detail on what actually went on during these wars	18
17201	3902	If you want kids to know about the history of our country, they need to know what actually happened	19
17202	3902	There is no point in trying to hide the truth	20
17203	3902	Overall, most kids in the @LOCATION1 have heard offensive language or graphic content	21
17204	3902	Whether it was from a parent or even their best friend, they have heard it	22
17205	3902	So why woyld we try to hide this from them	23
17206	3902	Keep these books, movies, music, and more in the libraries for the benefits of the adults, the kids, and for the history of the country.	24
17207	3904	Many people in the @LOCATION1 read	0
17208	3904	Books, magazines, news papers, and music are a great passing time	1
17209	3904	I enjoy reading books about people with special powers	2
17210	3904	such as necromancers	3
17211	3904	If we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries, what would we have left	4
17212	3904	I, for one, don't like reading @ORGANIZATION1 books, which seem to be the only type of book that wouldn't offend someone, unless they have some severe hatred towards letters	5
17213	3904	Think for a moment about what you like	6
17214	3904	Think about your interest in music, art, and the style of books or magazines that you read	7
17215	3904	Now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors: the library	8
17216	3904	You @MONTH1 be baffled as to why all of your loves have dissappeared	9
17217	3904	That book you love, the one about necromancers, it's offensive to @CAPS1 because only @CAPS2 has the power of waking the dead	10
17218	3904	The song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online	11
17219	3904	Its use of certain words are offensive to those with 'sensitive' ears	12
17220	3904	If I were to walk into a library and find that all the 'offensive' works had been band, I would be shocked	13
17221	3904	Every one in the universe finds certain things offensive	14
17222	3904	My @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher thinks that rap and hip-hop or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I think that some of those songs hold a different meaning	15
17223	3904	If everything offensive were to be taken away, what would be left	16
17224	3904	Nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read	17
17225	3904	Heck, @PERSON1' works are offensive to some people, they think he was crazy, and who wants their children to read a book written by a bafoon	18
17226	3904	Also, the less the library contains, the less people go	19
17227	3904	Libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive	20
17228	3904	All of the books we had hoped to read would have to be bought online, if it were still allowed	21
17229	3904	For all of the Book @CAPS5 out there, finding an attention-getting, eye-opening book is like finding buried treasure	22
17230	3904	It's an event that changes your life, makes your blood rush, and leaves you hanging onto your seat	23
17231	3904	It's an adventure played in your head, one that you set the specific details of each character, or it's the book that provides the knowledge that feeds your brain every time a new sentence is stored	24
17232	3904	Taking away everything offensive is like having a child being taken away, you can't replace that love with a distraction	25
17233	3905	Do I belive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc	0
17234	3905	should be remove from the shelves if they are found offensive @CAPS1 choice is no	1
17235	3905	I have several reasons for that one is that this is a free country and a person has the right to speak on how they feel or whats on there mind	2
17236	3905	And that should be aceptable any where cause every on has their on opinion about what they like or read	3
17237	3905	And if you feel that it offen you maybe you shouldn't be reading it or watching it or what ever the case @MONTH1 be	4
17238	3905	You can find something else to read that you'll enjoy or your friends and family @MONTH1 like,                    @CAPS1 second reason is that you can learn from stuff that @MONTH1 offen you and any kind of way	5
17239	3905	Such as this magazine I read about black males sagging there pants many white people that seen there pants below there waist had something negative to say about the young men	6
17240	3905	They only jugde a book by its cover because they didn't know nothing about the person, that they was talking about and one of the black males was a honor student in high school that was going to attend a white college	7
17241	3905	And when many whites started to find out they begin to question the young man about how he dress and why	8
17242	3905	He told them this is a free country I can do what ever I like and whites liked that he spoke up for his self	9
17243	3905	So with @CAPS1 reason being said I find it not right to remove certain materials,such as books, music, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	10
17244	3905	So I hope you enjoyed reading @CAPS1 essay	11
17245	3905	If you have any arguments or questions you can surely contact me	12
17246	3906	No Censorship     Do you enjoy reading interesting books, watching superb movies, or listening to appealing music that some people don't approve of	0
17247	3906	Most people would answer yes to the question because anything that a person reads, watches, or listens to @MONTH1 be found offensive or crude to someone else	1
17248	3906	Certain materials in libraries should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because different people find different materials offensive, people sometimes specifically come to libraries to search out materials they can't find elsewhere, and if a person finds a material offensive, they don't have to keep reading, watching, or listening to it	2
17249	3906	The first reason reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because different people find different materials offensive	3
17250	3906	Each person is different, and people have all sorts of opinions on books, movies, magazines, music, etc	4
17251	3906	Also, several different ethnicities exist in the world and many nonfiction books educate people on different cultures around the world	5
17252	3906	The ethnicity of the people living in the culture @MONTH1 find what the authors of nonfiction books are writing about them offensive because the book is talking about something in their culture they wouldn't want the public hearing about	6
17253	3906	However, the public needs to be educated on the cultures of different people	7
17254	3906	Students do research in libraries for research projects and essays	8
17255	3906	Also, books pertaining to racism such as To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 and books about slaves @MONTH1 be offensive to the race that is being victimized in the book	9
17256	3906	In contrast, some people @MONTH1 love the book because of the a good theme, symbolism, word usage, etc	10
17257	3906	So, who would be the judge of whether a material is offensive of not	11
17258	3906	If the person who is doing this for a certain library finds many materials in the library offensive, the whole library could close down because many materials that could have been popular were taken out of the library	12
17259	3906	Another reason why certain materials shouldn't be removed off shelves if they are found offensive is because sometimes people specifically come to libraries to search out materials they cannot find elsewhere	13
17260	3906	Libraries are the one place that people go if they are looking for that certain book or maybe even a movie they can't find at a video store	14
17261	3906	In my experience, there have been an infinite number of times where I have wanted to read a book I have heard about, and I've gone straight to the library and found it there	15
17262	3906	Also, because no video store exists in the town I live in, I go to the library for movies because I know they have a large selection	16
17263	3906	Some of the books and movies I or other people like @MONTH1 be found offensive to others, so if they were taken off of library shelves,I'm not sure if I would go to the library as often	17
17264	3906	A third reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because people don't have to read what they @MONTH1 find offensive	18
17265	3906	Everyone has the choice of what materials they acquire from a library, unless it's something they have to read for school	19
17266	3906	If a person hears about a book that @MONTH1 be found offensive to them, why would they read the book	20
17267	3906	Also, if a person accidentally checks out a book or watches a movie from the library that they find offensive, they can always just stop reading the book or watching the movie	21
17268	3906	Censorship shouldn't occur in libraries because everyone has different opinions	22
17269	3906	Libraries assume that if someone finds a material offensive, they'll just stop reading it	23
17270	3906	Also, if libraries take out all the materials anyone finds offensive, what will be left to read, watch, or listen to?	24
17271	3907	I do not think that any books should be taken out of libraries because they are found 'offensive'	0
17272	3907	Something that is offensive to me @MONTH1 not be offensive to another	1
17273	3907	Although I have all the right in the world to object to a book that I find inappropriate, somebody else might believe that that book is completely appropriate	2
17274	3907	The main issues that most people have with books are foul language, sex, and difference in opinion	3
17275	3907	These three catagories are very sensitive issues, some @MONTH1 not be comfortable disscussing these issues	4
17276	3907	Many books in the library systems today contain foul language	5
17277	3907	Surprising enough a majority of the indecent language can be found in the young adult section	6
17278	3907	I don't believe that parents would be very happy to know what their children are reading	7
17279	3907	In our modern day world we are bombarded with images of sex and indecency	8
17280	3907	Books containing obscure acts are no different from television or magazines	9
17281	3907	Most romance novels are very descriptive and leave little room for imagination, and in the wrong hands can lead to some very prompting questions	10
17282	3907	Difference in opinion can be a big problem for some libraries if patrons do not like the message a book sends	11
17283	3907	Religion, politics, and morals can lead to some nasty debates, but sometimes we have to just agree to disagree	12
17284	3907	Can teenagers handle that kind of language and sexuality in a responsible way	13
17285	3907	Should the books be taken off the shelf just on the basis that we don''t agree with what it says	14
17286	3907	Should there be a sensor on what can and can't be put in libraries	15
17287	3907	I dont think that any books should be taken off of library shelves	16
17288	3907	If you don't agree with the book then don't read it	17
17289	3907	Instead of blaming libraries for what your children read, perhaps you should look at your own parenting and make sure they arn't reading something they shouldn't	18
17290	3908	'@CAPS1 - @CAPS2 or No?'     Katherine Paterson's quote about offensive books is completely true, and I @PERCENT1 agree with her	0
17291	3908	She's saying that if everyone had the right to remove a book they found offensive off of every shelf, there would be no more books for people in the world	1
17292	3908	There are most likely books that one person could find offensive, but others do not	2
17293	3908	What would the world have left if almost all books are taken off the shelf	3
17294	3908	I do not think that offensive materials such as books should be removed from shelves because not everybody could find them offensive and could be depriving people of their favorite subjects, I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book, and because there would not be books left in the world	4
17295	3908	There are books about every single subject in the world	5
17296	3908	Some are about subjects we love and could read about for days	6
17297	3908	Others are about subjects that we hate or that just plain bore us	7
17298	3908	Though whatever the subject is, whether it be about the media, science fiction, romance, or anything else, there are different people in the world who love reading about different subjects	8
17299	3908	If a person had the right to remove a certain type of book from libraries and stores, say a romance book, because she found it offensive in some way and it was taken off the shelves, then a person who loved reading that book would be deprived from it because one person found it offensive	9
17300	3908	Just because on person finds a book offensive, doesn't mean everyone else in the world would too	10
17301	3908	I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book	11
17302	3908	In my @CAPS3 class, we were assigned to read 'The @CAPS4 in the @CAPS5'	12
17303	3908	As we were reading the book I honestly thought it was a very interesting story	13
17304	3908	Though later with some research I found out that the book was banned in alot of schools all over the @LOCATION1	14
17305	3908	Teachers from those schools reported that there were some very subjective words and events in the book	15
17306	3908	I do agree that there was some bad language, but I don't think that's a reason to ban the book from schools	16
17307	3908	It's an awesome story that won a couple awards, and my class also enjoyed it	17
17308	3908	My experience with this proved another point that certain books should not be banned	18
17309	3908	Just as @PERSON1 stated, if every person was given a right to ban certain books from libraries, there wouldn't be books left in the world for people to read	19
17310	3908	There are millions of people in the world	20
17311	3908	If every single person was able to ban one book in the @LOCATION1, what would we have left	21
17312	3908	There would probably be nothing left	22
17313	3908	If every book was gone from the @LOCATION1, what would kids in school be able to read	23
17314	3908	Kids would start reading at a slower rate, causing grades to drop	24
17315	3908	One little law change in @CAPS1 could cause great negative changes in the future	25
17316	3908	There's always going to be people in the world who find certain books offensive	26
17317	3908	That's never going to change, but people also have the freedom and choice to stay away from the book they abhor	27
17318	3908	Unless you're a student in school, you don't have to read or look at a book you find offensive, and you can also try to keep your kids from reading whatever it is because if you want one book banned off of shelves, your depriving other people of books	28
17319	3908	So I say every library stays the way they are now, and keep every book they have for all kids and adults.	29
17320	3909	Would you let someone ban your favorite movie, just because it has mildly offensive materials in it	0
17321	3909	I know I would not	1
17322	3909	If everyone had the right to ban books then we would have no books, because something would offend someone	2
17323	3909	You should not ban books because it desecrates our individuality , we have the freedom of press, and because it would ruin the future	3
17324	3909	If you ban a book then you are giving up your indiviuality	4
17325	3909	If you let someone decide what is offesive to you, then how can you express yourself	5
17326	3909	Therefore, by letting someone else decide what is appropriate for you to read, you are giving up your freedom	6
17327	3909	By banning books, you are not being yourself you are conforming to what other people want	7
17328	3909	Therefore, you should not ban books because, it demolishes your individuality, and it makes you conform to what other people want	8
17329	3909	There should not be any banning of books	9
17330	3909	You should not be able to ban books because we have the freedom of press	10
17331	3909	The freedom of press means that we can write whatever we want	11
17332	3909	However, you should not ban books because we have the freedom to choose what we read	12
17333	3909	This means that we as individuals should be able to decide what we want to read and what we do not	13
17334	3909	You should not ban books because we have the freedom of press, and because we have the freedom as individuals to read what we want	14
17335	3909	If you ban books then you will ruin the future	15
17336	3909	There are hundreds of really phenomenal books out there that would be banned, and future people would not be able to enjoy them	16
17337	3909	There are books that can change your life, and teach you how to deal with things, and  if we ban them then we are ruining the chance to help future people with their problems	17
17338	3909	People turn to books for knowledge, and help, and for ideas, and if we take away their books then how can we say that we are paving the way for the future if we are destroying it along the way	18
17339	3909	Books should not be banned because if they were then, we would be ruining the future for others, and we would be destroying our own future	19
17340	3909	In conclusion, books should not be banned because, it limits our individuality, we have the freedom of press, and because it destroys our future	20
17341	3909	If you ban books , more likely than not, your favorite book would get banned	21
17342	3909	Also, if everyone could ban books, then there would be nothing to read because all of the books would be banned	22
17343	3909	By banning books you are destroying the future, limiting our freedoms, and abolishing our indivuality.	23
17344	3912	No criteria such as books, @CAPS1's, magazines, etc	0
17345	3912	should be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive	1
17346	3912	The @LOCATION1 is a free country, which means that if you find something offensive such as a book or magazine, you don't have to read it	2
17347	3912	When people get all upset over a book or movie they saw it really drives me crazy, simply because you don't have to go see that movie, or go read that book	3
17348	3912	Different people find different things offensive, this can be because of race, gender, ethnicity, etc	4
17349	3912	So we shouldn't start removing materials from shelves just because a few people find it offensive	5
17350	3912	Some people think it is offensive that proffessional athletes get paid @MONEY1 for playing a game, when there are homeless people living on the street	6
17351	3912	Never the less the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is the most watched event in the world when it comes on	7
17352	3912	Just because a few people think sports are offensive doesn't mean they should be shut down for good	8
17353	3912	Another example is racial jokes, some people think they are funny when others find them very offensive	9
17354	3912	This still isn't going to stop people from telling racial jokes	10
17355	3912	Just as Katherine Paterson said, no criteria should be removed from the shelves in the library just because some people find it offensive	11
17356	3912	People do not find the same things offensive, so taking material off the shelves would not be the right way to deal with this issue	12
17357	3912	If you find something offensive then just dont pursue it	13
17358	3912	Almost every single book in the worls has something in it that someone, somewhere finds offensive	14
17359	3912	If we took all of these books off the shelves, there would be nothing left to read	15
17360	3912	This is a free country, which means you have the right to choose whether to read or pursue something or not	16
17361	3912	So instead choosing to eliminate books from the library, just dont read them, because maybe somebody doesn't find the same things offensive as you do, and they might like to read that book.	17
17362	3913	@CAPS4 I think all books,music,movies,magazines,etc	0
17363	3913	should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	1
17364	3913	The reason I say this is because what if their are little children that are willing too read grown up books and its all types of naked pictures and words thats not in a child vocabulary	2
17365	3913	Then they will pic up bad habbits and then use them with knowing what the words actually means	3
17366	3913	Then, I think music should be edited because somer music has cursing and talking about things that a young minded child or children shouldn't hear	4
17367	3913	The music should only be something children are suppose too listen too things that are in their age group	5
17368	3913	Next, I believe movies should be censored because now a days we are letting are children watch every and anything they want too	6
17369	3913	Things that doesnt control their language such as(@CAPS1 @CAPS2)	7
17370	3913	I believe that @CAPS3 sahow needs too be blocked because they really do and say exclusive things on that show, and alot of childern watch and repeat every thing they hear and see of that show	8
17371	3913	Finally, magazines...I say @CAPS4 too magazines because they have neaked girls and men on the covers and pages of these magazines that shows just way too much and they put things in the magazines too them look real when they are actually not	9
17372	3913	I think that etc.	10
17373	3913	should only be used when needed too research and do homework because children use enternet too watch exclusive things and listen too such bad things	11
17374	3913	Inconclusion, All together I think it should be an limit too everything we listen too and watch	12
17375	3913	Because children pick up everything they hear and see	13
17376	3914	I don't think they should remove anything thats offensive from the library cause honestly, most of the books author publish have something offensive in @CAPS1	0
17377	3914	I'ts not the library's fault, if there's children reading these books that are offensive then that's the parents fault for letting them read them	1
17378	3914	I've been to the library and listened to music, watched movies, and even read magazines that have some offensive content in @CAPS1, but if they weer to remove all the offensive content from the library, then the library would be half empty	2
17379	3914	I've seen parents discussing to the librarians about banning content thats not appropriate from the library, but why would @CAPS1 even matter if they can just ignore @CAPS1 and keep @CAPS1 away	3
17380	3914	@CAPS1 honestly isn't a big deal when @CAPS1 comes to these type of problems	4
17381	3914	I discussed this with my mom once and she completely agree's  with me	5
17382	3914	My mom said ' @CAPS1 would'nt be a problem as of today if they could of just ignored @CAPS1'	6
17383	3914	Also the music that they have should stay their wether or not its offensive cause people like to express themselves with the music that they listen to	7
17384	3914	The movies that are made these days all have innapropriate content in @CAPS1, wether its a rated @CAPS2 movie or not	8
17385	3914	As of all the argument going on about library's having offensive content, @CAPS1 should still be kept at the library and not removed	9
17386	3914	I'm sure alot of teens and adults enjoy all the content that's kept at the library	10
17387	3914	If children end up listening to the offensive music, or watching offensive movies then think about @CAPS1 like this, they need to grow up someday	11
17388	3914	If that's not the case then parents should keep them away from the content	12
17389	3915	Certain material such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from libraries	0
17390	3915	The quote by Katherine Paterson simply states that if everyone had  the right to remove a book from a shelf, then we would have no books left on the shelf for any of us	1
17391	3915	The world would be empty because there is always something that a person sees as offensive	2
17392	3915	To each person that finds the material offensive, there are always ten people who do not find it offensive at all	3
17393	3915	A person's beliefs can cloud their views on things like religion	4
17394	3915	There are so many wrong things out in the world that you can never do right by	5
17395	3915	In places like libraries, you never know who might come in to check something out	6
17396	3915	That is why it is recommended to make sections in the library	7
17397	3915	Adult novels, childrens book, science finction novels all in different sections of the library	8
17398	3915	This would make a parent cautious of where their child goes	9
17399	3915	If a child walks into the wrong sections, there is only one person to blame	10
17400	3915	the parent	11
17401	3915	Children always wander off into random places because of curiousity	12
17402	3915	Parents have to make sure that nothing horrific happens such seeing something that a  toddler or a teenager is not supposed to see	13
17403	3915	One object, such as a book, a movie, or a magazine, can teach a person millions of lessons	14
17404	3915	If those lesson are not tought yet, they will be tought later	15
17405	3915	In a harder way	16
17406	3915	The person might have to live the lesson to learn it	17
17407	3915	That is why some material should not be taken away	18
17408	3915	Everyone believes in different things	19
17409	3915	There is always someone that has a different opinion of things	20
17410	3915	The world contains of many things that people find offensive, but it does not mean those things have to go	21
17411	3915	There is always a choice of what to do and what not to do	22
17412	3915	Someone has to find a way to fix things and in a good kind of way where people can find peace with themselves and others	23
17413	3915	Removing material from libraries can cause many things	24
17414	3915	approval, disapproval, anger, and happiness	25
17415	3915	Most of all, it can cause fights, which later on can turn into war	26
17416	3915	The material in our libraries is meant to teach people about life, and people find that wrong, then it means they do not experience life	27
17417	3916	Censorship is not an easy question to anwser	0
17418	3916	it involves a great deal of thought	1
17419	3916	When thinking about a topic like this you must look at a greater picture	2
17420	3916	You should think about after math like thoughts and opinions from everyone else	3
17421	3916	When it comes to censorship in libraries I feel that all the books should be left on the selves	4
17422	3916	So, why would we take books away from people who want to read them just so that others don't	5
17423	3916	If you don't want a child to look at adult books, then you can censor them by watching them, and not taking them to places that have such books	6
17424	3916	This way other people can read these books	7
17425	3916	If you truely think about it, then you will relize that if you are trying to keep something from a teen they can, and will, find a way of getting it	8
17426	3916	If you are trying to keep things from them that will only make them want it more	9
17427	3916	Books are good for people	10
17428	3916	It tells them stories that cannot happen, past events they did not live through, and even the thoughts of others	11
17429	3916	Keeping books away from people is not good for them	12
17430	3916	they would not be able to learn from the things they read	13
17431	3916	So, maybe some books are more racie than others, that does not mean you should hide it from your children	14
17432	3916	If you were to start censoring books in libraries it could cause some problems	15
17433	3916	Now you will have no books for some people	16
17434	3916	You will have taken most books out of libraries because one person thinks it is not good for the children	17
17435	3916	This will cause arguments over what should and shouldn't be in the library, and people will stop going to the library all together	18
17436	3916	So, when you think about banning books just remember that there are other places to get books	19
17437	3916	Books are good for people especially teens, whos minds are developing	20
17438	3916	In some places books that are banned to other places are celebrated	21
17439	3916	When trying to get rid of books just think about the people you are taking them away from	22
17440	3917	You go to a library to read books, music, and magazines, but soon you find out that there are very offensive books	0
17441	3917	I strongly say yes, I agree that we should remove the books, magazines, and music from shelfs if they are offensive to people	1
17442	3917	We are suppost to feel safe reading books, listening to music, and reading magazines	2
17443	3917	When I was younger I went to the library all the time	3
17444	3917	I would get books to read and look at, and for a while I was excited to go to the library, but all the excitment went away after a few bad exsperiecnes	4
17445	3917	Remembering the names of the books are not going to come to me, but I know I was so upset by how the book was	5
17446	3917	It had words that I never heard before, and I got confused	6
17447	3917	This could happen to many little kids that come across a bad book, but really librarys should only have good books not bad.After that bad experience happened to me I ignored it like it will go away or something	7
17448	3917	Bad books, offensive books, should be taken off shelfs for good and never to return	8
17449	3917	I feel very strongly about this subject, because I am a book warm, I love to read books and being able to go to a library and find a good book thats not offinsive is all that I ask for in a library	9
17450	3917	Offensive books, music, and magazines should not be aloud to be in librarys at all	10
17451	3917	When kids read books or listen to music they want to be able to disappear in them, but if there are offensive stuff out there, how will they be able to do that	11
17452	3917	There are things that should be left out of libraries and that is offensive books, music, and magazines.In closing to my essay I still have full curage in my answer, I still say yes, they should remove the offensive books, music, and magazines	12
17453	3917	If it was your sister, your daughter, or your neciece that went into a library and found an offensive book, what would you say	13
17454	3917	I ask you this, how would you feel?	14
17455	3918	When I was in fifth grade, chaos broke out in my community	0
17456	3918	Everyone-- teachers, students, parents, school board members, community leaders-- had something to say about the topic at hand	1
17457	3918	This topic was censorship	2
17458	3918	A high schooler's parents were outraged that their daughter had read The @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 in class	3
17459	3918	In these parents' opinion, the rape scene in the book was far too disturbing for their precious daughter	4
17460	3918	While this seemed a fair stance to take, the parents then took things a step further	5
17461	3918	They sought to ban the book in the schools in our township, wanting to spare all other children the experience of being exposed to @CAPS1 was clearly traumatic material	6
17462	3918	This crusade of theirs posed the questions '@CAPS1 can and should be censored	7
17463	3918	And when?'	8
17464	3918	As the debate continued, I myself begin to ponder the subject	9
17465	3918	Who had the right to tell me @CAPS1 I could read	10
17466	3918	Or listen to	11
17467	3918	Or watch	12
17468	3918	The answer I came to was 'no one'	13
17469	3918	No one has the right to censor anyone else	14
17470	3918	This comes with one exception: parents and children	15
17471	3918	Parents have the responsibility to monitor their children	16
17472	3918	They must use their best judgement to decide @CAPS1 their children are old enough and mature enough to hear, see, or read	17
17473	3918	This was true in the censorship of @ORGANIZATION1, as well	18
17474	3918	No one fought back against the family because they did not want their own child to read the novel	19
17475	3918	it was only once they tried to keep others from the book that the problem arose	20
17476	3918	This is why libraries should not remove materials from their shelves because they are, in the eyes of some, offensive materials	21
17477	3918	Music you love @MONTH1 be offensive to me	22
17478	3918	Books your @CAPS2 teacher assigned @MONTH1 not be appropriate for five year olds	23
17479	3918	Your friends @MONTH1 be offended by your favorite movie or @CAPS3 show	24
17480	3918	These feelings are subjective	25
17481	3918	almost nothing is universally offensive or universally appropriate	26
17482	3918	We must, as a society, be able to accept this	27
17483	3918	We learn throguh @CAPS1 we see, @CAPS1 we hear, and @CAPS1 we read	28
17484	3918	These experiences teach us @CAPS1 to do, as well as teach us @CAPS1 not to do	29
17485	3918	Because of this, it would be unfair for materials to be removed from libraries based on solely opinions	30
17486	3918	To do that would be to steal from community members their chance to learn	31
17487	3918	Parents have the right to censor @CAPS1 their children see, hear, and read, but even this censorship must be done carefully in order to not hinder the child's ability to learn	32
17488	3918	We must not hinder our children's ability to learn from the mistakes of book and movie characters, singers, comedians, and artists	33
17489	3918	If we do take away that ability, we are setting these future adults up for making mistakes that could have been prevented by allowing them the chance to learn	34
17490	3918	Removing materials from the shelves of libraries based solely on opinions is not only damaging to our society, but, ultimately, it is dangerous to the people we wish to protect	35
17491	3919	Libraries are a source of information	0
17492	3919	They provide us with valuable research, entertainment, and cold hard facts	1
17493	3919	Therefore, I do not believe that libraries should have to censor the books that are supplied for the citizens to check out	2
17494	3919	Everyone is faced with choices in life	3
17495	3919	Some are more difficult than others and will have a greater impact on your life	4
17496	3919	We decide if we want to wear the black shirt or the grey shirt, the blue shorts or the brown shorts	5
17497	3919	Everyday we have choices	6
17498	3919	We also have choices at a library	7
17499	3919	If we see a book with a title that sounds like @CAPS2 might be offensive, then we should just walk past @CAPS2	8
17500	3919	Most libraries are organized and the book sections are clearly stated	9
17501	3919	Common sense would tell us that this section might contain offensive material	10
17502	3919	We have the choice on whether or not we check out a book that might offend us or not	11
17503	3919	If @CAPS2 does offend us, then @CAPS2's our own fault	12
17504	3919	The second reason libraries should not censor what books they provide goes right along with the choices we make in life	13
17505	3919	No one forces us to check out this book or that book	14
17506	3919	@CAPS2's a choice	15
17507	3919	No one puts a gun to our head and says, '@CAPS1 this book or you will die.' @CAPS2 just doesn't happen like that	16
17508	3919	No one forces us to @CAPS1 something we don't want to	17
17509	3919	@CAPS2's all up to you and how you feel about the book	18
17510	3919	Different subjects offend different people	19
17511	3919	I'm not offended by a curse word here or there, however	20
17512	3919	I am offended by sex related instances that often occur in movies or books	21
17513	3919	I make my own choice to not watch or @CAPS1 those kinds of materials	22
17514	3919	Since everyone is different, the sex related instances might not offend another group of people and they might see @CAPS2 as perfectly fine to watch or @CAPS1	23
17515	3919	Different subjects offend different people and taking away a book or movie because @CAPS2 offends one person should not happen	24
17516	3919	If libraries were to start censoring what materials they put on the shelf, I believe many people would be upset	25
17517	3919	Who would decide what is offensive and not offensive	26
17518	3919	@CAPS2 would upset too many customers and the use of libraries would probably dwindle	27
17519	3919	When you are in charge of censoring what goes on the shelf many problems come into play	28
17520	3919	Do you count different religions offensive because they blaspheme another religion's god	29
17521	3919	Do you count a certain work of fiction offensive because @CAPS2 contains one curse word in the whole book	30
17522	3919	There is no way to properly censor all your books without upsetting customers	31
17523	3919	I'm not saying that libraries should be allowed to show every magazine known to man	32
17524	3919	Some are obviously worse than others	33
17525	3919	but, when @CAPS2 comes to books and movies, the people know what they are checking out and know what they will find offensive	34
17526	3919	There are too many people in this world to try and censor the materials libraries display	35
17527	3919	Libraries should not censor the materials they display	36
17528	3920	Certain materials, such as books, music, magizines, etc., should never be removed just because a certain person, or group of people, find it offensive	0
17529	3920	The authors of these books have the right, as stated in the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, to have the freedom to say what the wish within the context of their own individual wrighting	1
17530	3920	Also, certain materials that some people find offensive have little to no offensiveness to many other people who @MONTH1 enjoy the book or movie	2
17531	3920	Finally, many books that are on the shelves of many of our libraries have no end to the amount of things that @MONTH1 be considered offensive, but allow a certain knowledge to be had by, not only the writer, but the reader as well	3
17532	3920	If something is stated in such an important document as the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, one that set the standard for living and set the laws of a nation to parchment, than it should, for lack of a better term, be taken with the utmost respect and dignity	4
17533	3920	Several great leaders, such as the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, decided that freedom of the press was a viable asset to a new and growing country	5
17534	3920	This simple fact alone should hold more than enough levity to allow all materials, no matter how offensive, to not only be published, but also enjoyed by all people	6
17535	3920	It is this simple freedom that causes books to be published, even written, no matter how offensive they @MONTH1 be	7
17536	3920	Certain materials that a person, or group of people, find offensive @MONTH1 not be offensive to everyone	8
17537	3920	No matter what religion, ethnicity, or moral values you hold, just because it is offensive to you does not mean that it is offensive to everyone	9
17538	3920	Many people in this world serve in their nations military, ones used to fight more battles than any history book could hold, is just one example that not everyone in this world holds the same morals or ideas that others do, and tensions will always arise because of it	10
17539	3920	That being said, this also holds true to the way certain people percieve literature and art	11
17540	3920	@ORGANIZATION3 would hate @ORGANIZATION2's art, and @ORGANIZATION2 would hate @ORGANIZATION3's, however, neither has the right to condone it or to keep it from the eyes of the world	12
17541	3920	Many times literature gets removed before their true meaning can be shown to anyone	13
17542	3920	This is disheartening for several reasons, one being that whatever we, as a human race, could've learned from this piece is now lost forever	14
17543	3920	Many books could teach the older generations how to leave a legacy for generations to come	15
17544	3920	Others @MONTH1 teach how future generations can change the world by simply working hard and doing their best	16
17545	3920	These are best portrayed in books that are sometimes removed from the shelves because of hard lessons or graphic words used	17
17546	3920	Is censorship in libraries ok	18
17547	3920	No	19
17548	3920	Not at all	20
17549	3920	All works of literature should be allowed to be read and enjoyed, not only by the author, but also by the young, the old, and all ages in between, of all races and religions	21
17550	3920	The longer we allow materials to be removed from the shelves of our libraries, the less of a chance we are giving, not only ourselves, but future generations to learn and be all that they can possibly be.	22
17551	3921	There are many different styles of  literature and media in this world	0
17552	3921	With this variety, it has to please at least one person	1
17553	3921	If not, why was it made	2
17554	3921	There come a point when things just become too much	3
17555	3921	Some media and literature has passed this point and it should not be allowed on shelves	4
17556	3921	Media is a huge influence in todays society	5
17557	3921	What would you do without it	6
17558	3921	Everyday, everyone is using media related, whether it is turning on the televison in the moring and watching the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' to opening up a magazine and reading about what famous person is in jail this time	7
17559	3921	You cannot get away from it	8
17560	3921	Teens @CAPS1 are truely addicted for the most part	9
17561	3921	We have video games, online chats (facebook and myspace), and moives	10
17562	3921	Many things we learn from these are not good for our minds and health	11
17563	3921	Some video games are good to play but when you become wrapped up in them, playing non stop, killing people and laughing at this, here you know there is something wrong	12
17564	3921	Our minds are exposed to so much immorality and violence, so we think it is okay to do	13
17565	3921	Many people see it as, the movie stars do it, so why can't we	14
17566	3921	@CAPS1's society is killing our minds and many young people who think their life is miserable just go out and commit suicide	15
17567	3921	Music can get too extensive as well	16
17568	3921	Yes, you have you oldies, country, and the jazz but when you add in the rap and heavy metal music, there is no understanding	17
17569	3921	Rap is all about who am I going to sleep with next and how many times I can have sex	18
17570	3921	Really, is this what our lives should be focused on	19
17571	3921	I didnt know people like the thought of a @CAPS3	20
17572	3921	Heavy metal music, you cannot understand it, but when you research the words you see that life is useless and why are we living	21
17573	3921	People say that this music helps them calm their anger down	22
17574	3921	Feeling realived after they have listen to it	23
17575	3921	You @MONTH1 be clam now but after hearing these words and banging your head around, what is going to happen when you do get extrememly mad	24
17576	3921	Too many lives are effect by @CAPS1's media and literature	25
17577	3921	Lives of friends have been lost and friendships have been ruined	26
17578	3921	Someone is always going to say a certain amount is too much, but I think we need to set a goal of how much is too much and try to save ourselves	27
17579	3921	We are not like a video game that has seconds lives	28
17580	3922	Books, music, movies and magazines are all offensive in different ways	0
17581	3922	They all are some how offensive to people if they have inappropreiate launguage or actions or stories in them	1
17582	3922	Should thease materials be taken off the shelf just because some people think they are to offensive to be on there and they don't want their children getting ahold of them	2
17583	3922	When I go to the library I see different sections, fiction, nonfiction, ect	3
17584	3922	What I don't see is a section marked 'offensive'	4
17585	3922	Librarys don't do that	5
17586	3922	If parents or anyone don't want their children or any other children reading offensive books they should go with them and make sure they don't pick up offensive books, or have them wait in the childrens area	6
17587	3922	Librarys usually don't carry offensive music	7
17588	3922	They have @CAPS1's for books to listen to	8
17589	3922	That might have offensive lauguage in it	9
17590	3922	Before renting or buying the @CAPS1 you should ask someone who works at the library to tell you if they conscider it offensive or not	10
17591	3922	If they don't know then don't get the @CAPS1	11
17592	3922	Most of the time you know what your looking for before you go to the library anyways	12
17593	3922	If movies are offensice they are marked rated @CAPS4	13
17594	3922	@NUM1 movies are the better ones	14
17595	3922	If parents or anyone do not want their children watching rated @CAPS4 movies before renting or buying one they should check the back where it always tells you	15
17596	3922	When I was young my mom would always check the back of movies because she didn't want me watching rated @CAPS4 movies	16
17597	3922	She herself thought most of them were too offensive for me to see	17
17598	3922	Most of the time magazines don't have offensive lauguage in it but they sometimes have inappropreiate pictures of men and women	18
17599	3922	They also have a bunch of gossip stories you might not want your children to read	19
17600	3922	But if your letting your children read this then you should read it before they do to make sure for yourself there is nothing you wouldn't want them reading	20
17601	3922	I don't think there is any reason to remove books, music, movies, magazines, ect., from the shelves if they are offensive to some	21
17602	3922	If a parent or anyone else doesn't want their children or anyone else's children to read something they think is offensive they should make sure they read something before they let them read it	22
17603	3922	Also walk around with the child in the library to make sure they don't pick up anything they wouldn't like, or have their child pick things from the childrens section	23
17604	3922	Some people like reading books, magazines some might think are offensive	24
17605	3922	Everyone shouldn't be punished for those who just don't want their children finding offensive things in the library	25
17606	3923	Books, movies, magazines, or music that is offensive in any way should not be aloud to be showed to the public	0
17607	3923	If these offensive things were not aloud to be showed I personally think it would help out are country is full of racist people and documents	1
17608	3923	Everytime you pick up a magazine or you watch a television show about a famous actress or musician you see embarrassing aspects of their lives all over the world	2
17609	3923	This is not right at all	3
17610	3923	People should be shown respect and allowed to have some privacy in there life	4
17611	3923	If it wasn't for actress and musicians we wouldn't have any television shows to watch	5
17612	3923	There would be no use to have radio's	6
17613	3923	There would be no reason to, their would be nobody to sing songs for us	7
17614	3923	Why would we want to embarrass these guys anyways	8
17615	3923	They work their tails off to produce new things for us	9
17616	3923	Books in the libraries should not have sexual assualts in them at all	10
17617	3923	Books like this in school libraries have no reason to be there	11
17618	3923	Why would you want your child to read something like that out of a book in the school	12
17619	3923	Expecially foul language in materials at school	13
17620	3923	Books at the library should have good examples in them not vaulgar sayings	14
17621	3923	This is a disgrace to the school	15
17622	3923	Movies are a big concern	16
17623	3923	Any child or young adult could go into the movie section and get any type of movie even if it is rated restricted	17
17624	3923	Would you want your child brining home a movie that had nudity in the film	18
17625	3923	I remember one time my little sister brought home a movie from are local library	19
17626	3923	This movie was a total disgrace to this library it had nudity, foul language, and lots of violence	20
17627	3923	I couldn't believe what I had just saw	21
17628	3923	My library would have something like this in the library	22
17629	3923	Children go there and pick movies out	23
17630	3923	My mother had went in and made a complaint about the restricted movies being in with the children films	24
17631	3923	She said that the movies should be seprate from the rest	25
17632	3923	You should have to be a certain age to rent this movie	26
17633	3923	Or atleast have a parents permission	27
17634	3923	Every local library or school library should be taking action in doing this for their community	28
17635	3923	Lets keep are children and young adults away from violence	29
17636	3923	By allowing this in are school libraries and local libraries it is just saying it's ok to letting this violence in	30
17637	3923	We should put a stop to it and prevote good attitudes	31
17638	3923	So please take the violence off the shelf	32
17639	3924	Are some materials, such as books, movies, magazines should be removed from the shelves if those things are found offenisve	0
17640	3924	There are some things in books are movies that are offensive, and that other younger adults shouldnt watch or read	1
17641	3924	Reading a book also says alot about certain topics that are offensive	2
17642	3924	But at the same time can you learn from these things such as finding it in a book or seeing it on tv	3
17643	3924	So I dont think that certain things that are found offenisive should be taken off the shelves, because people should learn off of these things	4
17644	3924	Some people have a hard time understanding what's right and wrong in life, because their not getting the full effect in life and what it is meant	5
17645	3924	The problem I think is people @MONTH1 not think certain things are offensive because they might not know what it mean	6
17646	3924	Movies on the other hand has a different side of the fence	7
17647	3924	Movies can affect someone, especially someone who is very young	8
17648	3924	Those children can look what's on tv and copy exactly what they are doing	9
17649	3924	They also @MONTH1 be a role model which is not always good for some people	10
17650	3924	Another thing is that music plays a big role in someone's life because there is sad music, loving music and also violent music	11
17651	3924	Music can define a person	12
17652	3924	For example if you are listening to a sad song, you @MONTH1 feel sad or depressed	13
17653	3924	Or a person listening to hard and violent music @MONTH1 feel upset or angry	14
17654	3924	Certain music that peole listen to can define who they are	15
17655	3924	Especially when i had said it determines what kind of a mood you are in	16
17656	3924	I think when people listen to the music he or she likes, it defines who they are, it shows what kind of mood there are in	17
17657	3924	Secondly, magazines are an advertisement	18
17658	3924	It shows everything, it tells you stories	19
17659	3924	Just like in the movies if you see it, youre going to do it	20
17660	3924	But magazines are different, they show like the styles, and life stories of others	21
17661	3924	When you see things you @MONTH1 want to do things just as the what the magazine	22
17662	3924	Usually when you look in a magazine you usually see pictures so its not as big of effect as the others such as the music and movies	23
17663	3924	They more likely describe things	24
17664	3924	Books on the other hand are similar	25
17665	3924	You can learn what's in a book just by reading it	26
17666	3924	So if a person @MONTH1 read something about voilence he or she @MONTH1 think it is right to do so	27
17667	3924	Even if that particular book is telling you what's right about the topic	28
17668	3924	So no I dont think that some books that are found offensive beacause only that person or indvidual can learn what being offensive is	29
17669	3924	So keeping these types of books @MONTH1 help other people who are readers.	30
17670	3925	What is @LOCATION1's main idea in the area of art, language, and music	0
17671	3925	The idea of @LOCATION1 in those catagories is freedom	1
17672	3925	Freedom is to write what we want, draw what we want, and say what we want, and in all, to express ourselves freely as a person	2
17673	3925	It is one of the amendments in the '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2', known as freedom of speech	3
17674	3925	Saying that, I believe that we should not be able to ban, censor, or remove any books, music, or movies from the @CAPS3 public	4
17675	3925	It is their right as an @CAPS3 to buy what they want	5
17676	3925	It takes away @CAPS2 from people, and when they do that, it makes citizens feel like toddlers	6
17677	3925	They can't choose for themselves what to see and what not to see	7
17678	3925	Everything in this world can be offensive to somebody	8
17679	3925	Just because that one person finds something bad or distasteful, doesn't mean that they have to make everyone else stop seeing it	9
17680	3925	That's what gives the world its varieties	10
17681	3925	What someone might think is weird, somebody else might think is normal	11
17682	3925	When that happens, why is it okay to take away what makes that person feel normal	12
17683	3925	Just to make the other person feel better	13
17684	3925	I walked into the store once before wanting to buy a videogame	14
17685	3925	I found one I thought looked cool, took it off the shelf, and brought it up to the cashier	15
17686	3925	He took one look at the game, saw the rating for it, and said that I had to have an adult with me to purchase the game	16
17687	3925	I went on about how my dad would not care if I bought this game	17
17688	3925	The cashier said it didn't matter and that I still had to have him here	18
17689	3925	Then I had to search throughout the store looking for my dad so that he could walk back to the cashier to buy the game for me	19
17690	3925	What difference did it make	20
17691	3925	In the end I got the game anyway	21
17692	3925	That experience I had at the store that day let me know how it felt to have my wanting of something be shot down	22
17693	3925	It made me feel like a baby that needed permission to do something	23
17694	3925	It also helps me know how the writers, artists, and movie directors feel when they get their work censored, rejected, or banned because somebody somewhere found it offensive	24
17695	3925	We need to let people express how they feel	25
17696	3925	If we didn't then a lot of the stuff today would be different	26
17697	3925	@PERSON1 had the idea of the world not being flat and that he could sail all the way around the world without falling off of it	27
17698	3925	Everybody thought he was crazy and got angry at his thinking	28
17699	3925	But he did it, and proved himself right	29
17700	3925	Galilaue @CAPS5 thought came up with the theory that the sun did not revolve around the @LOCATION2	30
17701	3925	He started doing experiments and tried to prove his theory	31
17702	3925	The people of where he did his work got engraged and through him into exile and imprisoned him	32
17703	3925	After that somebody thought that it was a good idea, he experimented on it, and the people supported him	33
17704	3925	Now we have that theory as a fact, that the sun doesn't revolve around the @LOCATION2	34
17705	3925	That is what makes freedom of speech so important to the world	35
17706	3925	It makes people think in different ways	36
17707	3925	It helps people think of new ideas	37
17708	3925	Freedom is the key to any way of living.	38
17709	3926	There are alot of things that u can find in the libraies that you can find to be inapporite to some but not all people	0
17710	3926	if there was something that i was ofined by then i would ask them to pull it off the shelf	1
17711	3926	if u have somewhat of a project to do then go to the libarie to meet some friends and work on it there	2
17712	3926	If you need help to finding a book for your project ask the person at the desk where to find it	3
17713	3926	The libarie is here to help those that dont have a computer at home, they can go to the libarie and do there work there	4
17714	3926	If they would have alot of there books on a disc or dvds,movies,tape players alot more people would want to read more	5
17715	3926	If that all libarie had all the same books  then they would have more people in and out getting the book they want to read	6
17716	3926	if there was little kids that want to read kid books then they should have a section for them	7
17717	3926	All the libarie should get ride of the inapporite books that some of the people right off the shelf so that they dont have people complaing about the material on the shelf	8
17718	3926	Theres probale about @NUM1 to @NUM2 libarie in the @LOCATION1	9
17719	3926	I know for fact that there something inapporite on the shelf in all ther libaries	10
17720	3926	There are tons and tons of books in all of the libarie so theres a good chance there something out there that someone will find they dont like and ask for it to be taking off the shelf	11
17721	3926	if they would get alot of people saying they are offenied by it then they would have to take it off	12
17722	3926	There is also alot of magasins out there that some should be seen to little kids	13
17723	3926	if they get on that talks about drugs and some other things they could be offensive by that	14
17724	3926	all magasins should have some what of a rating on them	15
17725	3926	you would have to be older than @NUM3 years of age to get a pg-@NUM3 mag	16
17726	3926	some of the magasins should be for little kid that go there all the time and adult	17
17727	3926	they should have them divid into sections for little kids and adults	18
17728	3926	They need to respect all the people in the libarie at that time	19
17729	3926	I think that theres some of that here in are home town but not @PERCENT1 postive there is	20
17730	3926	We all have the right to ask them to take it off the shelf and if they dint then they well get into trouble	21
17731	3927	Dear newspaper editor,      @CAPS1 I am writing to tell you about the censorship in the libraries of @LOCATION1	0
17732	3927	This doesn't seem like a big problem to some, but a very major problem for others	1
17733	3927	Censorship has removed books, music, magazines, movies, and other things, from the shelf of local stores and libraries for being offensive to the seller or workers	2
17734	3927	Its not what some store owners or library owners like in some cases, but its not about what they like	3
17735	3927	Its about the people in general that have a certian intrest towards that subject	4
17736	3927	Some people have even removed the @CAPS2 from local library systems	5
17737	3927	Does it even matter what the owner wants to sell	6
17738	3927	In most cases, no	7
17739	3927	The belief in a religon or even a book, magazine, or movie that had one small comment about	8
17740	3927	sex, drugs or alchol is removed for just that	9
17741	3927	If we remove everything about any of that, the only thing left @CAPS3 be childrens books	10
17742	3927	Some people @CAPS3 find ways to get those censored as well	11
17743	3927	We @CAPS3 become illiterate without books, magazines and other things of that nature	12
17744	3927	Theres even an account of a person being fired from there job for reading a magazine on there break at work	13
17745	3927	What happens if we all listen to another person that wishes to remove a book off the shelf	14
17746	3927	Then another and another, we @CAPS3 have no books in our libraries or stores	15
17747	3927	This censorship is a major problem, very few people really care about this subject	16
17748	3927	Most think it should be done to most items, some think we dont need to censor anything, as we are a free country	17
17749	3927	So newspaper editor, please question yourself, ask yourself, '@CAPS3 I like to have all of my favorite magazines, books, and movies gone forever, never to be seen again?' Then everyone will know the answer.	18
17750	3928	Some books on the shelf at libraries have bad things in it, whether it is what the book is about, the curse words in them, or just not very aproprit for some of the age groups	0
17751	3928	Should the books at the libraries be censored or should we just leave them for the reader to decide if they want to read it or not	1
17752	3928	I dont think any of the books, or magazines should be censered	2
17753	3928	If some one wants to read a book with curse words in it or anything like that then let them	3
17754	3928	The parents @MONTH1 not let some kids read them but some parents just dont care	4
17755	3928	I think if they read them they might say them but they will learn not to say them and that they are not very nice to say	5
17756	3928	Should the movies you get at libraries be censered	6
17757	3928	I dont think they should because the parents arent going to let them get it or watch the movie if they dont think it is something they need to be watching	7
17758	3928	The kids know what they can and cant watch so if it is something they know they cant watch then they shouldnt get it	8
17759	3928	The kids might get it but the parents could take it away and tell them they cant watch it	9
17760	3928	Should all books.magazines, music, or movies from libraries be censered	10
17761	3928	No	11
17762	3928	If it is a library at school everything has to be school approprit	12
17763	3928	If the book, movie, magazine, or music is not approprit they the school cant lone it out	13
17764	3928	A public library can but there are mostly adults there	14
17765	3928	The kids should know what they can and cant watch, read, or listen to, so they should know better than to get something they cant read, watch, listen to, or look at	15
17766	3928	Some parents @MONTH1 agree to censering them but if you do that you are limiting the books everyone can read	16
17767	3928	Even the parents or adults wouldnt be able to read them aswell	17
17768	3929	What do you think about Books	0
17769	3929	Do you think it matters how appropriate they are	1
17770	3929	Well im going to tell you my oppinion on the books that should and shouldn't be in libraries	2
17771	3929	I think that there are many different few from many different people on books	3
17772	3929	Someone just cant say that they think a book shouldn't be in a library period	4
17773	3929	I think that if maybe it is a inappropriate book from someone in grade school to read then it should be in the high school or a public library	5
17774	3929	I can see that some parents @MONTH1 not want to have their kid reading it but i think that they are going to hear a lot worse and see worse than a book is going to have	6
17775	3929	I can also see where parents are coming from when they say that they dont want there child reading that kind of book	7
17776	3929	I belive that if a kid wants to read it than they are going to read it, parents shouldn't be so up tight on what there kids read	8
17777	3929	I know that they want to protect their kid from seeing that stuff but its going to happen one day so they might as well get used to it	9
17778	3929	Also a grade school shouldn't even have a book that would be considered inappropriate to a student in there library, or should have a parent sign somethign saying that they are ok with it	10
17779	3929	So inconclusion thats what I say if parents have a problem with it than they should discuss it with the school	11
17780	3929	They should just go in and talk to the librarian and tell them that they dont want their child to check out such books	12
17781	3929	All a parent would have to do is go in to the school or where ever their child is getting the book and tell them that and it would solve all problems	13
17782	3930	To censor, or not to censor	0
17783	3930	That is the question	1
17784	3930	I am positive that there are a great amount of different views portaining to this topic	2
17785	3930	Everyone will have very good points on either using, or not using censorship in the library	3
17786	3930	Although this is true, I believe that there are many more valid reasons not to use censorship in libraries	4
17787	3930	First of all, how offensive can library material truly be	5
17788	3930	I do not believe that is very offensive at all	6
17789	3930	There will be movies and material specifically designed for a mature an older age group	7
17790	3930	This is fine	8
17791	3930	if the person choosing the material is of age then he or she should have no reason not to choose advanced material	9
17792	3930	A mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life	10
17793	3930	Sooner or later, they will have to be intruduced into the real life	11
17794	3930	It would not be beneficial to them or society if they are sheltered their entire lives	12
17795	3930	Also, if the person is still a child, there should be no reason for a child to choose the older level of material	13
17796	3930	There @MONTH1 be times when he does	14
17797	3930	however, this is not a problem because all the parent has to do is explain to him that he is not of age yet	15
17798	3930	This is an easy fix	16
17799	3930	As I said earlier, ther is no reason we all need to read the same thing	17
17800	3930	Variety is what makes libraries apealing to the customers	18
17801	3930	Who would want to go to a library with all the same books	19
17802	3930	I myself would not	20
17803	3930	Within the library, there are sections specifically just for children	21
17804	3930	If all the slightly offensive material was to be taken out of libraries, that would eliminate a large portion of the customers	22
17805	3930	Also, this would discourage writers from even producing thier material	23
17806	3930	thus hindering their income and motivation	24
17807	3930	We have freedom and choice in @LOCATION1, and I feel this would go against @CAPS1 values if they were to induce censorhip in a harmless library	25
17808	3930	No one is perfect and we all make mistakes	26
17809	3930	However, we can also improve and learn from them	27
17810	3930	If a person does choose an inapropriate book, they will most likely learn and improve from their mistake	28
17811	3930	We have a choice about what to choose when we go into the library	29
17812	3930	I believe if not all, the majority of the time we make the right choice	30
17813	3930	Libraries are a supercenter of learning and information	31
17814	3930	This would not be true if certain portions of information began to be removed	32
17815	3930	I have had many worthwhile times in the library and was never once harmed or offended	33
17816	3930	Libraries are here to help and not to hinder our learning	34
17817	3930	I am most likely not the only one who feels pleased with the way libraries are now and feel no need to change what is good	35
17818	3931	My opinions on the censorship in libraries are that libraries are great places to get information on books such as biographies, fiction, nonfiction, science fiction, and other genre books	0
17819	3931	I don't believe that books, music, movies, magnizines and other things should not be removed off the shelves because people love music and they want to get information about the artist who made the songs and information about the artist	1
17820	3931	Also people want to learn the lyrics to the song	2
17821	3931	The reason why books shouldn't be removed off the shelves is becuase people enjoy reading books and they want to know what the book is about and have some information about the book	3
17822	3931	Books are very important to people and need some entertainment other than television	4
17823	3931	Also people used books to study for the book is going to be read and then going to be tested on	5
17824	3931	The books that are found offensive should be removed because people get very upset if they find out that the book is talking bad about them	6
17825	3931	Unless some people are not mature at all and can't read books that are not even talking about them	7
17826	3931	Movies shouldn't be removed off of shelves because people love watching movies and they are very entertaining to them	8
17827	3931	If a movie is very offensive to the people, yes it is probably best to remove the movie because they don't want to watch it anymore	9
17828	3931	But other movies are not even bad	10
17829	3931	Yes some movies have foul language but people still enjoy it	11
17830	3931	But sometimes in movies people hear something from the movie and they spread it around the @LOCATION1	12
17831	3931	Then everybody starts saying the foul language	13
17832	3931	People just have to learn how to not use foul language when not needed	14
17833	3931	Magazines shouldn't be removed because people love reading magazines especially sports related	15
17834	3931	I know I love reading sports magazines because I am a very true sports fan and sports are very important to me other than school	16
17835	3931	There are very inappropiate magazines that children shouldn't be reading and they should be removed off of shelves	17
17836	3931	Magazines are also used for different things such as comics, housework, as for ladies makeup, perfume, etc	18
17837	3931	People think that magazines are very important to the society	19
17838	3932	Censorship in libraries is almost a primitve if not childish way to exclude what one might think to be offensive from everyone else, is it not	0
17839	3932	Think about it	1
17840	3932	A kid who doesn't let another kid play with him at recess today, only because he stuck his tongue out at him during math the previous day, seems pretty childish, and several much more reasonable solutions come to mind to anyone who sits and thinks about the situation for more than a second	2
17841	3932	This scenario runs paralell with censorship in libraries	3
17842	3932	A book is a book to be read	4
17843	3932	That is, of course, an obvious statement	5
17844	3932	But why read a book	6
17845	3932	To get information	7
17846	3932	To learn something that you did not know, or to build on knowledge that you already had	8
17847	3932	How do you cook an exquisite meal	9
17848	3932	Go read a book to find out	10
17849	3932	How do you graph linear equations	11
17850	3932	There are books that will explain it for you	12
17851	3932	Is it fair for an avid astronomer, fealing no need to know how long a turkey needs to stay in an oven, to remove a book that teaches that very thing	13
17852	3932	Now, of course cooking a turkey will most likely not come across as offensive to someone perusing through their local library, however, think about this	14
17853	3932	The book has been written, so is that not a sure sign it is not offensive to at least one person, that being the author	15
17854	3932	There are things people will not agree with	16
17855	3932	And just when you think you find something everyone likes, someone will come along and disturb the peace	17
17856	3932	Not everyone likes rap music, but it is still playing on the radio	18
17857	3932	It is free choice to listen to it	19
17858	3932	It is a free choice to read a book, regardless of what it says	20
17859	3932	Just because people have the misfortune to be subjected to material they find offensive, by accident or otherwise, and then project their disdainful comments toward someone in charge, does not mean that the offensive material should be thrown out	21
17860	3932	Perhaps, radios and libraries can be even further examined	22
17861	3932	Radios have specific channels, playing specific music	23
17862	3932	There is a country music channel for those who want to listen to country music	24
17863	3932	As for libraries, there is of course the @ORGANIZATION1, but that is about as far as categoriazation goes	25
17864	3932	Suppose books be even further distinguished by the location within a library	26
17865	3932	A certain area designated for certain genres	27
17866	3932	That way, if you happen to find books about @CAPS1 concentration camps distasteful, then you can avoid the @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 ailse of the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 section in your library	28
17867	3932	Problem @CAPS8	29
17868	3932	I find it hard to see something as offensive if I can't even literally see it	30
17869	3932	You see, outright removal isn't really the best option for pleasing dissatisfied people	31
17870	3932	Compromise is	32
17871	3932	Now, after having thought about this situation for more than a second, I'm sure you have thought of much more reasonable solutions than something so ludicrous as censorship	33
17872	3932	Now the best part is seeing people enjoy books, and not being offended by the ones they don't like anymore	34
17873	3934	'@CAPS1 Books, Movies, Music, and Magazines?'          @CAPS2 do people take @CAPS1 books	0
17874	3934	Some people believe books, movies, music, and magazines should be sensored or 'band'	1
17875	3934	Why do people believe this should happen	2
17876	3934	Well there will be three topics that will be talked about in this eassy	3
17877	3934	The three topics are children, @CAPS4, and religion	4
17878	3934	First, '@CAPS3'	5
17879	3934	Many parents themselves don't want there child to be exposed to viloence, volgure language, or even possible drugs	6
17880	3934	Viloence is one of the main problems to do with all four of these types of entertainment	7
17881	3934	Influencing there child could cause a loss by doing things as far known as stupidty	8
17882	3934	Another is volgure language, to adults for a generation above us, they take it as being disrespectful	9
17883	3934	News wide to this very day deals with drugs and teens getting more into them, causing an overdose that could lead to death	10
17884	3934	Second, '@CAPS4'	11
17885	3934	Many people going from black to whites to eveyone around the world with different colored skin or more different type of features as one another	12
17886	3934	Here starts racsism, meaning against ones color or there ethics	13
17887	3934	Now to this day it has been calmed down but there was a time that certain words labeled certian people showing that they were less than others	14
17888	3934	Leading this to riots and gang viloents to earning respect	15
17889	3934	They want to be treated as an equal not less than others that which our ancentors did them in the past	16
17890	3934	Third, '@CAPS5'	17
17891	3934	Religion is pretty big in the world and shows alot about the past and what certain people believe in	18
17892	3934	Religion is shown in these four types of form in these objects	19
17893	3934	Everyone believes theres is the right way and someone elses is the wrong	20
17894	3934	They cause conflicts in between one an another	21
17895	3934	So trying to keep them from bein banned isn't going to help for religion matters, because people do talk and some people out there want to change certain people to believe what they think is right	22
17896	3934	So back to @CAPS2 would everyone or some take to @CAPS1 books, movies, music, magazines	23
17897	3934	Well it's going to be exposed sooner or later	24
17898	3934	Options are let it happen now or let it happen later	25
17899	3934	The sooner could be better or for the worst	26
17900	3934	Either matters just let happen what happens, someone will learn from there experience so why banned now?	27
17901	3935	Leave @CAPS1 on the Shelves                                             In every library it is intitle to have all types of books, movies, and magazines.Even if they are good or bad	0
17902	3935	Not everyone in this world is going to have the same likings.If there are people that are offened of what types of sources they find in the library I don't think it should be taken off of the shelves	1
17903	3935	Everyone in able to agree or disagree in what types of things they like	2
17904	3935	If the library didn't how would people learn about things today that are going on in this world, because not everything that is said on television is true	3
17905	3935	Every library in the world should not take certian books, movies, and magazines down just so kids or anyone else can't read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1 because there might be other people who would like to read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1	4
17906	3935	If the libraries took down certain books, movies, and magazines then it shouldn't even be called a library because it is suppose to have all types of sources	5
17907	3935	Not everyone is going to have the same opinion on whether or not certain books,movies, or magazines should be in the library, but all types of these sources should stay in the library beacuse if they are offensive to some people there aren't going to be like that for everyone so that wouldnt't be fair for the other people who enjoy reading, looking at magazines to see whats new ,or watching all different types of moive, and listening to music	6
17908	3935	I think that the librarians should not take anything down in their libraries because they know what they are doing when they put those sources on the shelves and also they should stay on the shelves because if they didn't want people to feel offended then they wouldn't have made books, moive, or magazine that would offend people today	7
17909	3935	Libraries don't leave the sources on the shelves on perpose for people to feel offended, they leave @CAPS1 for other people to read.With this being said all types or books, magazines, or movies should be left on the shelves to help other people learn what they want to learn about	8
17910	3936	I think that they shounldn't remove the censorship books in the libraries because so bigger kids can read the books not the little kids because they don't need to here the kind of words in the books	0
17911	3936	Also the little  kids has to small of ear to hear and also to small of eyes to even see the words in the book like that	1
17912	3936	The bigger kids like in grades @NUM1  should be able to look at the books because it will be word that have heard before	2
17913	3936	The books shouldn't be in the lower grade libraries becaues the little kids will ckeack the books out of the libraries, like the books thatis called @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because it says the n word a lot of times, a other one is @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 becaues says a lot of dirt words like the f, s, and ect.words that they don't need to hear that young of age	3
17914	3936	Another reason why it wounld not be fair to the bigger kids if they take away from the libraries becaues they tring to get the out of the libraries so the littler kids don't get the books to take home read at home	4
17915	3936	If you are going to take away the books tale them away from the grades @NUM2 becaues the that the book called @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 And @CAPS5 will be bad for those kids to read	5
17916	3936	Some more reasons why bigger kids should read the books and why not the little kids shouldn't read the books	6
17917	3936	Why should the bigger kids in grade @NUM1 should read them becaues they are bigger then the littler kids are	7
17918	3936	The littler kids shouldn't becaues we don't want the littler kids to go home and say the words to there mom, dad, grandme, grandpa, and ect	8
17919	3936	Now I have come to the end of my persuasive essay for the newpaper about my reflecting on why or why not we should get reid of the consorship in the libraraies	9
17920	3936	Also until the next time I right again about this topic and I hopest you like this persuasive essay for the newpaper.	10
17921	3937	Picture for yourself you, as a @NUM1 year old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history, @LOCATION1	0
17922	3937	Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for 'corrupting the minds of the children.' @CAPS1 what	1
17923	3937	One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn't like his ideas	2
17924	3937	This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day	3
17925	3937	Censorship is not only wrong, its unnecessary	4
17926	3937	Here's why	5
17927	3937	@CAPS1, when it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways	6
17928	3937	For example, some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person	7
17929	3937	Besides, most music and books are meant to entertain, not offend	8
17930	3937	Granted, some books are meant to be interpreted in a certain way, but that still doesn't mean that they were meant to offend	9
17931	3937	Think about it next to you look at a copy of '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1	10
17932	3937	is it really that offensive to you	11
17933	3937	When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, they usually expect you to read it because its of some educational value to you	12
17934	3937	Books like 'To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5' provide a huge educational value because they show what @CAPS6 culture was like, but everyday, someone new is trying to get it off the shelves of every school library in @LOCATION2 because they find it offensive	13
17935	3937	Ask yourself, is it right	14
17936	3937	The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness	15
17937	3937	There's one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, and no matter how many movies you ban, or how many songs you take away from us, the problem still isn't solved, its just been suppressed enough for different problems to arise, and those problem are that there are people who wanted to read this book @CAPS1 can't because you thought it was offensive	16
17938	3937	@CAPS1 this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature, and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves	17
17939	3937	@CAPS1 you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve	18
17940	3937	Nothing	19
17941	3937	Even if someone doesn't unban it, people can still teach and tell of what its about, making the ban worthless	20
17942	3937	I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this	21
17943	3937	Your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone	22
17944	3937	It affects a teacher's ability to teach, and a student's ability to learn	23
17945	3937	Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material	24
17946	3937	Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve	25
17947	3937	Either way, you still must know that bannig these things in wrong.	26
17948	3938	I think that the bad books, and all the adult books, magazines, and all the other articles should have its own room in the libraries	0
17949	3938	If you don't want little kids and teenagers in those kinds of books and magazines then put I lock on the door and if you have proof of @CAPS1 that shows your @NUM1 then you are going to be aloud back there if you don't have proof of @CAPS1 then I guess your not going back to the adult section	1
17950	3938	I say this because they have movies at the movie stores that are not aloud to be seen unless your @NUM1, but the thing is kids have imaginations that if you read a book you can also see pictures just like a movie	2
17951	3938	The movies in the movie store are locked up in a back room where you have to be @NUM1 or older to go back there and look	3
17952	3938	I bet its ruff when your kid is reading books and getting bad words out of them and saying them around like an even younger sibling, because then thats just going to cause a bigger problem then what you started out with	4
17953	3938	People have to understand theses days that kids are growing up way to fast to just leave stuff like that laying around	5
17954	3938	Parents need to keep stuff like magazines, movies, pictures, books and stuff like that up away from kids	6
17955	3938	I feel like once you become a parent you automatically think your smarter than a kid but yet kids are pretty darn smart	7
17956	3938	I understand its only a word but its disrespectful to have your kids running around cussing and saying inaproperiate things to nice people	8
17957	3938	When kids do that then othere parents that don't let their kids do that stuff think ' wow these parents obviously don't care'	9
17958	3938	I have a feeling that its never going to stop but it would be better if childrens parents did not let them cuss around other people ok at home if your parents don't care then sure but when you go out to eat or something and your son or daughter is over there cussing like a freight train its all because of those books she has been reading, the magazines and the movies	10
17959	3938	Im going to close this little description now and im still against kids cussing under the age of being a mature teen	11
17960	3939	There are many inapropriate types of intertainment in the world but does that mean we should take them all away	0
17961	3939	I believe that censoring things such as books, movies and music in a library is not a good idea	1
17962	3939	We would not have any diversity in the world or any type of intertainment because everyone has a different view on what they think is offensive or inapropriate	2
17963	3939	With censoring materials in a library it will extremly limit on what we can learn	3
17964	3939	For example if someone thought that a book about how an animal catches it pray was offensive then if a person was interested in learnig about that topic they would not able to	4
17965	3939	Many peoples only way of reserch is at a library, so if they had on assignment for work and they could only get informatoin on it there they would not be able to finish their job if only one person thought a book about that topic was offincive	5
17966	3939	Also people in the medical feild have to watch many movies deminstrating sertain proseedures	6
17967	3939	What would they do if one person thought that a movie on what they were doing was offensive	7
17968	3939	They might not be able to save a persons life	8
17969	3939	With censoring there would be no diverstiy	9
17970	3939	Censoring would cause us to have a very small choise in what we could read for intertainment	10
17971	3939	It might even cause us to not have any books to read for intertainment because it one person does not like a sertain book it can be gotten rid of	11
17972	3939	So if not all the books are gone there is still going to be a few books to chose from	12
17973	3939	It would cause all to read the same books therefor making the diverstiy very small	13
17974	3939	I see only a few good points in censoring	14
17975	3939	Yes, it would prevent children from learning or hearing about inapropriate or offensive things but, that is what is in our world and i believe that we just have to accept it	15
17976	3939	Our society today is filled with crime, haterid, sexually things, and profanity but there is no changing that	16
17977	3939	Censoring @MONTH1 hide that for a small amount of time but its not going to keep it away forever	17
17978	3939	Censoring is not going to change our society	18
17979	3939	I do not think that we should censor thing in our libaries	19
17980	3939	It can only lead to a downfall in our communitys	20
17981	3939	It is a great idea but i do not believe that it can help us more than it would hurt us	21
17982	3939	Censoring will cuz a lack in diversity education and a realization of our society	22
17983	3940	Now, one way or another that certain peice of material will be found and be used	0
17984	3940	Someone out there in this world will appreciate that material and want to share it with others	1
17985	3940	So really, either way you @MONTH1 try to remove any material that you think is offensive but is it your right	2
17986	3940	I don't suppose so, I would consider that unfair	3
17987	3940	It's unfair that you were able to see this material and just because you thought it was offensive, it does not mean that others @MONTH1 find that offensive in their opinion	4
17988	3940	So the idea of pulling them off the shelf for your own selfish opinion is ridiculous	5
17989	3940	For you to do that would be defeating the purpose of being an @CAPS1 for the author of that material	6
17990	3940	Having the freedom to sell or convey something they want viewers, readers, listeners, etc	7
17991	3940	to look at and use, would not happen because a person or a small group of people consider it offensive	8
17992	3940	It's big world out there, you think just because you can try and hide certain material from people in your area to see, that no one will find a way, people will always find a way for it to get out or be found	9
17993	3940	It would be as if your trying to control what people should be viewing, listening, reading, etc	10
17994	3940	Almost as if your in control of people, but you got to realize that you can't hide everything in this world	11
17995	3940	Also that not everybody in this world has the same mind set as you do, and that what ever you find offensive @MONTH1 not, or actually does not mean everyone else does	12
17996	3940	So this leads to my conclusion that it should not be your right to remove material from shelves that only you or group of people find offensive	13
17997	3940	Do not try to control what people or childeren should view, listen, or read becuase it will be found sooner or later	14
17998	3940	No matter how hard you want this world to be perfect, reality is that it won't happen and you can't keep everthing hidden	15
17999	3943	What I do think is that they should keep everything in the library	0
18000	3943	Some people like to stay and read the newspaper and listen to music while out in the library	1
18001	3943	If you do think it's offensive, then don't read it or just pick out another book	2
18002	3943	Everybody has their own ideas on a library and if they want their voices heard let them speak it out	3
18003	3943	What I think about all this stuff in the library these days are good for the kids so they can learn faster and have a lot more to look forward to when they do get older	4
18004	3943	My own experiences in the library that I do see that there is a lot more people in the library and there is a lot more you can do instead of reading books most of the time	5
18005	3943	You can read magazines or newspapers to pass the time when no one is home or to hang out with, and it does get boring just reading books so try something different for a little while then go back reading the book that you did start with and wanted to take a break from	6
18006	3943	Then other people have their own voice to say something if they don't want it in their library	7
18007	3943	Some of my observations that I have seen were not really good	8
18008	3943	I've seen some protesters in front of the libraries and I have seen them close down because of it	9
18009	3943	But people sometime can take it to far and do sometimes burn it to the ground	10
18010	3943	I have seen people cry over it and it makes me really upset that I want to do something to help them but I really can't do nothing	11
18011	3943	The most valueable thing is the kids and young children that read the books	12
18012	3943	What if someone burn down you home, this is how these kids feel when you close down the most safe place to them	13
18013	3943	They have the biggest voice of everybody put together	14
18014	3943	That if you do something that make them feel better that would be really good to them	15
18015	3943	That they have not done anything to deserve this kind of mess that we put them through	16
18016	3943	It is very difficult to have somewhere to go to read but there is nowhere to go	17
18017	3943	If you don't want to be quiet then let your voice be heard aroud the world and have the freedom to let it come out	18
18018	3943	You have three diffenent voices your own, other people that do or don't agree and you have your children	19
18019	3943	So which one are you going to listen to	20
18020	3943	When you have a choice and you have to make it and hope you make the right one	21
18021	3944	Should you conceal a child from the inappropriate half of the world	0
18022	3944	Not letting them hear, see, or read the bad in the world	1
18023	3944	Letting them grow up as innocent as possible	2
18024	3944	Should libraries take these procautions	3
18025	3944	In a world like ours were bad things happen everyday when it comes to people comminting suicide, being murdered, goverment scams, and even terrorist attacks its hard to keep people that shouldnt know, from knowing	4
18026	3944	It is very easy for our nation to figure things out, all we have to do is watch @CAPS1.V	5
18027	3944	or even go to our local library	6
18028	3944	While we already censor what goes onto our television, we dont think to care as much for our libraries	7
18029	3944	Our libraries have anything from thousands of book and magizines and now having an equal, or more, amounts of movies, @CAPS2, and videogames	8
18030	3944	I think a library should have censorship when it comes to what they have and how they organize it	9
18031	3944	There should be different sections of libraries, much like they do now, of age groups and what is appropriate for them, and to avoid people checking-out items that are from sections above them they have an age group security check on the libraries card fileing system	10
18032	3944	This sounds very complicated but at least we are doing as much as possible for trying not to expose anyone to anything they are to young for	11
18033	3944	When it comes to offensive material, I think that should not be taken off the shelf but put into a different place in the library	12
18034	3944	Some people need to read some thing they find offensive, maybe they need to read it for a class, maybe the book is offensive but needs to be read because it teaches a very good life lesson	13
18035	3944	There is a book that is called '@CAPS3' its by a man with the last name of @LOCATION1	14
18036	3944	It sounds very offensive but it actually teaches people the origin of the word and how it came to be offensive to people	15
18037	3944	It @MONTH1 be offensive for some people to read but it teaches a lesson in why people shouldnt say it	16
18038	3944	Yes, there are always going to be some parents out there that don'@CAPS1 care as much when it comes to what there child read, watches, listens to, or plays	17
18039	3944	But, for there kids to get it, there parents will have to come and get it for them, that way the parents know what they are extracting from the library.	18
18040	3945	We all find things offensive, wether it be in a book, magazine, movie, cd, tv show, or a newspaper article	0
18041	3945	Libraries hold all of those items and somepeople @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not want to remove the items that they think are offensive, but would that be right	1
18042	3945	If everyone went to the library and took everything that they thought was offensive off the shelves, we would have nothing left	2
18043	3945	Maybe writers should just cut down on things that are innapropriate, racist, or things that include foul language	3
18044	3945	Then not as many people would be offended and they would not have any problems with letting their children pick out books on their own	4
18045	3945	Although, it @MONTH1 not be the writers at fault here	5
18046	3945	It @MONTH1 be the readers	6
18047	3945	Some people should just stop taking everything so seriously, then they would not have to worry about things like what their children are reading	7
18048	3945	Yes most adult things now are innapropriate for children, but that's why it is for adults	8
18049	3945	Children have their own selection of books and movies	9
18050	3945	And parents need to realize that maybe they should take their kids to the childrens section	10
18051	3945	All types of entertainment are categorized by age and people should start paying more attention to that	11
18052	3945	If parents started watching what their kids do, then they would not be worrying about the reading or watching something they should not be	12
18053	3945	That is what parents are for, taking care of their children and some people do not do a very good job of that	13
18054	3945	If there is a book you read and it is something you do not want your child to read, it is probably something you read when you were older, so do not worry about it until they get to that age	14
18055	3945	And maybe then it would be ok of they read it, because they are old enough to realize right from wrong	15
18056	3945	Parents can not always control what their children do	16
18057	3945	And if they do by chance pick up the book their parents never wanted them to read, they @MONTH1 see it in a different way than their mother of father did and they @MONTH1 learn a very valuable lesson from it.	17
18058	3946	When going to a library you expect to see various books, movies, music, magazines, and maybe other items	0
18059	3946	If a person is looking for a book that maybe could be offensive to a race, culture, religion, or etc., they should still be able to check out that book	1
18060	3946	Libraries shouldnt be able to control those situtations, because it's a persons choice or adults choice to read those kinds of stories	2
18061	3946	In our country we are allowed to express our opinion by the @CAPS1	3
18062	3946	The @CAPS1 includes free speech which insures that anyone can express their personal feelings or their opinion on certain matters	4
18063	3946	If a person would want to check out a book that could offended another individual technically by the law they have the right to do so	5
18064	3946	I'm not condoning that someone should read books, listen to music, or even watch movies that could be hateful or cruel, but by the law its ok for people to want to read, listen, or watch those works	6
18065	3946	Libraries are government funded organizations	7
18066	3946	Therefore meaning they dont have the right to disregard these works	8
18067	3946	The government pays for the books that are purchased into the library	9
18068	3946	This means they need books that people would want to read, and be interested in even though some gruops of people might not agree its there job	10
18069	3946	I'm not encouraging reading these novels or listening to offensive music, but as citizens of the @LOCATION1 we are allowed to listen to what we want, and read anything we want, because thats what our country is meant to stand for freedom	11
18070	3946	When I think of @LOCATION2 i think freedom, and i have to say I'm proud our country stands for that, and we should  stand for that freedom even when it comes to the small things in life	12
18071	3948	Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines	0
18072	3948	Some people take offense to them	1
18073	3948	Others do not	2
18074	3948	For me I dont	3
18075	3948	I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves because there are different types for different types of people	4
18076	3948	If a person took offense from a book or magazine I believe that person should just put it back	5
18077	3948	If books that offended people couldn't be on the shelves there would be no books on the shelves because I'm sure there's atleast one person in the world that would take offense to each book	6
18078	3948	There are o lot of people in the world after all	7
18079	3948	For music there's different types also	8
18080	3948	There's rap, country, rock, pop and many more	9
18081	3948	For example if someone likes rap but not country that person has a choice to listen to rap and not country	10
18082	3948	If that person doesn't like country though it shouldn't be removed because others @MONTH1 like country and want to listen to it	11
18083	3948	For movies there are many different types	12
18084	3948	There's horror, comedy, romance and many more	13
18085	3948	That's why at the theater there's different rooms for different movies	14
18086	3948	People always have a choice	15
18087	3948	Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines	16
18088	3948	Some people take offense to them although some don't	17
18089	3948	Every person is different	18
18090	3948	People like different things	19
18091	3948	That is, in my opinion, the beauty of human nature	20
18092	3949	The views on censorship in libraries definitely varies from person to person	0
18093	3949	There are those who are offended by the material that is out there for anyone to access, and then there are those who want the right to read, listen, and watch whatever they choose	1
18094	3949	I believe there are pros and cons to each choice, either way you look at it, but there does need to be some sort of censorship in libraries	2
18095	3949	the line must be drawn somewhere	3
18096	3949	The lyrics in music can come off extremely offensive to some people	4
18097	3949	The inappropriate scenes in movies, whether it be involving two people of opposite sex or intense action moments, are not something people of a young age should be exposed to	5
18098	3949	The easy access to the library is part of the problem	6
18099	3949	Someone of any age can get their hands on just about anything they want	7
18100	3949	In my own experience, I have had the opportunity to get whatever I wanted at the library	8
18101	3949	The advertising pictures on the cover of books, movies, magazines, etc., gave me a false sense of what the material really contained when I was younger	9
18102	3949	I came home from a day at the library with materials that my parents did not approve of	10
18103	3949	If you look at it from the other point of view, you would probably be thinking, if we got rid of all material that someone would find offensive, our libraries would be left with close to nothing	11
18104	3949	In reality, I believe that once people realized that exposure to this kind of material is offensive, authors would change the way they would write	12
18105	3949	directors would change the way they produced movies	13
18106	3949	artists would change the lyrics to their songs	14
18107	3949	So yes, library's shelves would have been rid of many materials, but they would be replaced with what the people want	15
18108	3949	Others might argue that they have the right to read, listen, and watch what they would like	16
18109	3949	This @MONTH1 be true, but shouldn't others have the right to let their children go to libraries without worrying about the gruesome material they might be exposed to	17
18110	3949	Although to some people this argument @MONTH1 go either way, if the line is never drawn on what is available, who knows what the world @MONTH1 come to	18
18111	3949	From here, the material can only get more offensive, more disturbing, and leave a bigger effect on the minds of people	19
18112	3949	Children will be exposed to the 'evils' of this world at even a younger age, and if that is all they ever know, they won't realize what else this world has to offer them	20
18113	3949	Authors, directors, producers, and artists will all change their material if we show them that it is not what we want.	21
18114	3950	Do I believe that certain materials , such as books, music, movies,magazines, and so on should be removed	0
18115	3950	Yes I think that they should all be removed, becuase it could hurt people's feelings, and could make them do plenty of things	1
18116	3950	Such as suicide, drama, and so on having any of these things at a library could hurt someone's feelings	2
18117	3950	I really dont think that I would like having racial comments about me in a book so why would anyone else	3
18118	3950	I think that by removing all these things could make some peoples lifes better	4
18119	3950	From exsperince in the library last week, I seen this girl that ran to her mom crying becuase she was african american, and the book said something about thier race	5
18120	3950	And she was all worried that what happend back in the day with all the slavery would happen again	6
18121	3950	I would be so terified reading about people that would make fun of my life, call me names, and beat me, that kind of thing would just ruien my day	7
18122	3950	Now I think that library's would learn to take this certain stuff out of stock	8
18123	3950	Now that I have gave you convincing arguments about my choice from my own experience	9
18124	3950	I think that they should take my advice, and realize that having that kind of stuff is not good for kids,teenagers, or even adults that they should not be reading that stuff	10
18125	3950	All it does is bring some people down, make them cry, and also so stupid stuff	11
18126	3950	Now by making the choice to remove all this stuff would be smart, and make things better for everyone	12
18127	3951	Imagine walking into a library where the shelves are empty	0
18128	3951	A library where there are no books to lose one's self in the pages	1
18129	3951	A library where we are not allowed to read controversial classics that fill and open our minds to new views	2
18130	3951	A library where works of literature such as @ORGANIZATION1, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, and @PERSON1 are not on the shelves awaiting students to dive into their pages	3
18131	3951	Some of the greatest books ever written are respected for their controversy and mind blowing ideas	4
18132	3951	Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice which is being taken over by modern technology	5
18133	3951	A number of children in the @LOCATION1 are unable to read at their appropriate grade level	6
18134	3951	This number is greatly increasing due to poor education opportunities, lack of interest in education, and lack of resources in the @LOCATION1	7
18135	3951	Reading is the fundamental basis for each and every school subject	8
18136	3951	It is proven that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall more successful students	9
18137	3951	However, by censoring what books are allowed in a classroom and library we are taking away a child's chance to broaden their minds	10
18138	3951	We are also taking away books that @MONTH1 interest a child	11
18139	3951	Children are @PERCENT1 more likely to read a book that they are interested in	12
18140	3951	Allowing a child not to read a book, such as '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' is unpractical and harmful to the child	13
18141	3951	By taking away a book that students greatly enjoy it discourages them from reading altogether	14
18142	3951	A person not only has the right to the best education one can receive, they also have the right to read whatever they want	15
18143	3951	Books open up a child's mind to new places and adventures that they @MONTH1 not ever be able to experience in their lifetime	16
18144	3951	Books have the ability to broaden people's minds	17
18145	3951	Some of the most interesting and controversial books that challenge an individuals beliefs and thoughts are being taken off the shelves and no longer readily available to people	18
18146	3951	@LOCATION2 was founded on the basis of freedoms	19
18147	3951	freedom of speech, freedom of thought	20
18148	3951	Why should this freedom not apply to books	21
18149	3951	Why should any person be allowed to tell another person what you can and can not read	22
18150	3951	And why should these books be available to everyone through public libraries	23
18151	3951	This freedom should apply to books	24
18152	3951	No one should be allowed to tell another person what they can and can not read	25
18153	3951	And these books should not be censored in public and school libraries	26
18154	3951	No one should be denied the chance to learn	27
18155	3951	By censoring books in libraries throughout @LOCATION2, millions of children are being denied the chance to learn	28
18156	3951	We live in a world where televisions, computers, iPods, and cell phones can be found in most homes and in everyone's hands	29
18157	3951	Books are thought of as 'a thing of the past' and not up to speed with today's technology	30
18158	3951	However, books are an important part of one's education	31
18159	3951	Censoring libraries discourage kids to read even more than they already are discouraged to reading	32
18160	3951	Kids do not want to be told what they can and can not read and by taking away the books they want we are supressing their minds	33
18161	3951	Censoring will only make them want to read less, and play on the computer more	34
18162	3951	Censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non effective method	35
18163	3951	Kids with internet access can look up almost anything on their home computers	36
18164	3951	The things they find on the internet will be more controversial then the majority of books that are being censored	37
18165	3951	A favorite book of many kids is the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series	38
18166	3951	These books have been taken out of many libraries for their use of witchcraft	39
18167	3951	However a child could go home and watch the movies or search the internet for something more controversial	40
18168	3951	Censoring is pointless because children have other ways of viewing things that would be censored in a library	41
18169	3951	Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice that is being taken over by modern technology	42
18170	3951	Today's youth is exposed to wars, terrorist attacks, gangs, domestic violence and drive bys everyday	43
18171	3951	The world of books can be an escape from the world they live in	44
18172	3951	Books can help a child overcome poverty, mental challenges, and violence everyday	45
18173	3951	The pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves	46
18174	3951	The inspirational stories in books have inspired millions to achieve more then they thought possible	47
18175	3951	Censoring would take away the chances for our future generations to become inspired by these books	48
18176	3951	Censoring would only hurt our youth and the greatness that they can accomplish.	49
18177	3953	'@CAPS1 are you reading' asked mom	0
18178	3953	I immediatley hid the book behind my back, knowing she wouldn't like the idea of me reading such an in depth book	1
18179	3953	Some parent don't like for their kids to read some content	2
18180	3953	If it's not okay at home it shouldn't be okay at school	3
18181	3953	There is some subjects that maybe we shouldn't but we do because our parents say no	4
18182	3953	Removing said subjects will remove the chance of disobeying or parents, and coping behavor from book	5
18183	3953	There are books, movies, magazines and music that is 'cool', but not all that appropriate	6
18184	3953	Some movies and music use offensive language and actions that some kids pick up on and refelct actors, actresses and artists	7
18185	3953	Soon they start making a name for themselves by using such language or actions and eventually becomes known as the bad kid	8
18186	3953	Students such as myself are inferior to being popular or noticed, so they feel the need to do things to become noticed	9
18187	3953	Most things students model after are the things they see, hear, or watch, such as the media	10
18188	3953	It is wise to set censors in the libraries, for students	11
18189	3953	Though some students don't nessicearily want censorship in libraries, it is only for their best intrest to remove materials that are offensive	12
18190	3953	It will make students including myself better people by not learning of the things we hear about or watch	13
18191	3953	I think by using censorship it will help student to make the decison at home to to become involved in such thing	14
18192	3953	I have noticed that students often watch how movie stars and famous people act, if they are a fan or the famous person then they are more likey to model after them and do the thing they do	15
18193	3953	Lets say I was a fan of @PERSON1 and I read that she stole something	16
18194	3953	Being a fan of her I would either find someone else to model after or do as she does because it cool	17
18195	3953	If I did the things @PERSON2 done my parents would most likely kill me, and if I got luck somehow and they didn't then I would go to jail for sure	18
18196	3953	So  in conclusion, I think censorship is important in libraires because it insures the well being of students and protects them form things they odn't need to be part of	19
18197	3953	I would respect the idea of censory in my school becaus eI would know it is only there to help me	20
18198	3953	I hope that all students see that it is important not to be subject to violence, sex, drugs, drama, through movies, music, magazines, or book	21
18199	3954	I don't think censorship should be practiced in libraries, @CAPS7 it's not fair to everybody	0
18200	3954	If censorship was practiced everywhere, there probably would not be any movies or anything entertaining out, due to a large amount of people complaining	1
18201	3954	I have a few reasons also @CAPS6 I think there should not be censorship in libraries	2
18202	3954	@CAPS5 first reason is freedom of the press	3
18203	3954	In our @ORGANIZATION1, we are given the right of writing what we want, and if censorship continues, we will lose one of our rights	4
18204	3954	I don't think that's fair to control what we want to write or read	5
18205	3954	Another reason I have would be freedom of speech	6
18206	3954	Also written in our @ORGANIZATION1 of @ORGANIZATION1, we are given the right to say what we want, and nobody can control that	7
18207	3954	If we keep using censorship, then this right will also be taken away from us	8
18208	3954	We're slowly losing our @CAPS1 given rights, @CAPS7 people are offended by books and things of that nature	9
18209	3954	A personal experience I have was one day @CAPS5 friend and I were going to go to the library to get a book for our history report	10
18210	3954	The report had to be over the @DATE1's and slavery	11
18211	3954	Unfortunately, @CAPS5 friend was @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and he had a hard time not being offended by the assignment	12
18212	3954	When we got to the library, things got worse	13
18213	3954	All of the books we found were over how bad the slaves were treated back then	14
18214	3954	@CAPS5 friend was getting very upset at this point	15
18215	3954	Finally, he saw another book making fun of the slaves, then he went up to the librarian asking, '@CAPS4 you take those books off the shelf and put them somewhere else?' The librarian just looked at him with a straight face and said, 'No	16
18216	3954	What makes you think you should get any special treatment?' @CAPS5 friend was dumbfounded	17
18217	3954	He couldn't believe what he had just heard	18
18218	3954	After he had came back over to where I was sitting, I had told him that she was right	19
18219	3954	'@CAPS6's that?', he said	20
18220	3954	I said, '@CAPS7 if she would've taken all those books down, she would've had to take about every other book down too, @CAPS7 somebody would find something hurtful.' 'You know, your probably right,' he said	21
18221	3954	Censorship isn't fair, @CAPS7 it limits us to our abilities and what we enjoy	22
18222	3954	It's not fair to punish other people based on what they read, write, or say	23
18223	3954	We all have our own preferences	24
18224	3954	how would you like it if yours got taken away?	25
18225	3955	Some people often go to the library to check out books,movies,magazines,etc..But what some people might not realize is that some of the things that they have at the library might be offensive towards certain people	0
18226	3955	I think that everything thats in the libraries should stay there	1
18227	3955	Obviously the library allowed it there for some reason	2
18228	3955	So honestly it cant be that bad	3
18229	3955	I do not think certain things should be removed from the library	4
18230	3955	People have to realize that that's life	5
18231	3955	There's going to be certain things that you dont like but you have to deal with it	6
18232	3955	If you watch tv you'll notice that there's some offensive things towards certain people	7
18233	3955	But no one really makes a huge thing out of it	8
18234	3955	The books might be offensive to you but to someone else it could just be another book that they want to read.With no intentive purpose of offending anyone	9
18235	3955	The library is all about learning	10
18236	3955	Everything is for educational purposes	11
18237	3955	I've read books that I stopped and thought about for a second while I was reading it and noticed that theres some pretty harsh things in it	12
18238	3955	But i didn't complain about it, I just kept reading	13
18239	3955	Alot of books are based off of true events so no matter how offensive they are to people, you just have to think what the purpose was for the author to create this book and same thing with movies	14
18240	3955	So people can see what the author has to say	15
18241	3955	Everyone has the right to have their own opinion	16
18242	3955	And thats what most magazine articles are about	17
18243	3955	Expressing what you think about a certain topic	18
18244	3955	Even in the @CAPS1 class that im in now we had to read 'To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3'	19
18245	3955	Some @CAPS4 @CAPS5 people might think its racist but it reallu isn't	20
18246	3955	The author is trying to get his point out	21
18247	3955	Of how things use to be before white and colored people were treated the same	22
18248	3955	Now if you still think that is being offensive towards you or other people then thats alright	23
18249	3955	That's why this is a free country	24
18250	3955	Everyone has the right to say how they feel and not get in trouble for it	25
18251	3955	So I hope i got the point across that it's alright for some things to be offensive towards people	26
18252	3955	As long as thats not the whole point of what you watching or reading	27
18253	3955	Which i doubt it is	28
18254	3955	So next time your reading or watching something that is offending you	29
18255	3955	Think about the point that the person who wrote or made the movie were trying to get across	30
18256	3955	Mybe by it offending you it is getting the point across.	31
18257	3956	Censorship can be a very good thing	0
18258	3956	It keeps inapropriate material from falling into the wrong hands	1
18259	3956	It also keeps the horrors that are in the sensored material out of the community and that makes the community a better environment to live in	2
18260	3956	But too much censorship can become a bad thing	3
18261	3956	For instance @ORGANIZATION1 had an extreme censorship policy when he was burning all of those books	4
18262	3956	There also several books that talk about the censorship idea getting out of hand like the book @CAPS1 @NUM1	5
18263	3956	Libraries should censor some of there material	6
18264	3956	Books and magazines need to be censored according to there content	7
18265	3956	Books and magazines both use words and sometimes pictures to get there point across	8
18266	3956	If a book is using vulgar and inapropiate language in should be in some way censored	9
18267	3956	With this in mind I should not be able to pick a book and open it to find sexual dialog	10
18268	3956	I also shouldn't be able to find the constant use of swear words in a book or magazine	11
18269	3956	Also lots of people get offended with violence and lots of gore	12
18270	3956	Magazines and books also use pictures to help get there point across	13
18271	3956	If there are inapropriate pictures in either of the two sources that material should be censored	14
18272	3956	If I am walking through my local library and just see a magazine sitting ou with a nude picture on the front I'm going to wonder about my library's censorship policy	15
18273	3956	Another example would be that I pick up a book and start looking through it and it has an inapropiate picture in it, I am going to wonder about my library's censorship policy	16
18274	3956	Also if a magazine has an extremly violent picture or extremely gorey picture it should be cnesored	17
18275	3956	Overall if a book or magazine is extremely inapropriate, then it should be, in some way, censored	18
18276	3956	Music is another form of media that can be found at a library that should be censored	19
18277	3956	Musicians use artwork on the album sleeves to grab the attention of people	20
18278	3956	If that artwork includes swear words or inapropriate pictures it should be in some way or shape be censored	21
18279	3956	Musicians also play music of course	22
18280	3956	But if the lyrics to there songs are explicit or has many sexual themes it has to be conesored	23
18281	3956	Someone should have to deal with wading through music like that	24
18282	3956	No matter what, if an album of music is out of this world inaproiate, it should be censored	25
18283	3956	Movies are most likely the hardest things to sensor	26
18284	3956	This is because they use language, pictures, music, and video	27
18285	3956	Movies are multi-media monsters that can sometimes be very clean, and sometimes be very inapropriate	28
18286	3956	If a movie is rated @CAPS2 it should not be in a public library	29
18287	3956	Movies that are rated @CAPS3 for seual content, nudity, drug use, alcohol abuse, or swearing should be censored	30
18288	3956	A kid should not be able to get his hands on that kind of stuff in a public library	31
18289	3956	Also depending on how violent and a gorey a movie is it should be cenesored	32
18290	3956	Movies that are inapropiate, especially ones rated @CAPS3, should be censored	33
18291	3956	The fact that this debate even needs to happen is sad	34
18292	3956	But it does so we must censor certain things that people @MONTH1 get a offended by if they saw it in there public library	35
18293	3956	Things containing nudity, sexual content, swear words, gore, and violence to possibaly be censored	36
18294	3956	There also needs to be a line where we stop sensoring or pretty soon, just like Katherine Paterson said we won't have any books left	37
18295	3956	But overall there needs to be some type of censorship in public libraries.	38
18296	3958	Do I believe that our libraries have some books on their shelves that they shouldnt have	0
18297	3958	Well of course I think that there are some books, music, movies, magazies, that young children should not read about, hear, or watch	1
18298	3958	These kind of things affect our every day living	2
18299	3958	Lets start off with a book that has killing in it	3
18300	3958	I'm not a parent at the time, but I know for a fact that I would not wan't my children reading about that kind of violence	4
18301	3958	Thats not something that a twelve year old child should be reading about	5
18302	3958	Those kind of books could get kids thinking oh he killed someone why couldn't I, and thats how some kids grow up to be bad and have to go to jail at the age of @NUM1, because they have killed someone or tried at least	6
18303	3958	There also other books that some children shouldn't read about and that @MONTH1 be about slavery	7
18304	3958	If a mother doesn't want their child to know about slavery at the age their at there shouldn't be that type of book on the shelves for a ten year old to read about	8
18305	3958	I mean if I had family members that lived in the slavery days i for sure wouldn't wan't my kids to read about it, because that shows how white people disrespected the blacks and that could have an affect on that child	9
18306	3958	That could cause them not to like white people	10
18307	3958	Second is the music	11
18308	3958	I know that most libraries don't have all that bad music that is on the radios, but I'm sure there is some music that has something about steeling on it	12
18309	3958	Thats aother thing that could give kids the wrong idea and send them on the wrong track again	13
18310	3958	There's just some things children shouldn't hear unless their with one of their parents, and then that parent could explain to them that you shouldn't do what the song says	14
18311	3958	But they shouldn't be in our school or public libraries	15
18312	3958	The third thing is movies	16
18313	3958	There should not be any movies of killing, breaking in peoples houses or fighting at any sircumstance in a school library	17
18314	3958	School is not a place for a child to be watching those kind of things	18
18315	3958	That just gives a young child the wrong kind of idea, and isn't approperiate for schools to have	19
18316	3958	The last one is magazines	20
18317	3958	There should notbe magazines at school of women in their bathing suits or men with out shirts on	21
18318	3958	That could make the kid think he could do that and he could get him self in to big trouble	22
18319	3958	Thats what I think about the books, music, magazines, and movies in a library.	23
18320	3959	If there is any books, movies, music or magizines that is offensive, then I think it should be removed from the bookshelf because of caution for little kids	0
18321	3959	Everyone wants to look at different movies, books or music that isn't right for kids, but we all have too know where kids get acts from	1
18322	3959	The books can be left on the shelf, if the younger kids does not bother them	2
18323	3959	They have to know that adults don't always want to watch kids shows	3
18324	3959	There should be a right that adults can remove books from the shelf if its not right for there kids	4
18325	3959	Yes, books, magazines, movies and music should be left off the shelf if offensive	5
18326	3959	This is neccasary because they can watch the movies and learn bad habits from the shows, listen to the music and learn bad words, and look at magazines and see bad pictures	6
18327	3959	So have kids stay away from offensive materials	7
18328	3959	There is a lot of younger kids that love to get into stuff they are not suppose to	8
18329	3959	Such as bad movies not for their age, because kids learn their bad habits from t.v	9
18330	3959	shows or even movies	10
18331	3959	If the movie is offensive then it should definantly stay off the shelfs	11
18332	3959	Inless it is just grown ups in the house	12
18333	3959	If movies are just laying on the on the shelf or around the house	13
18334	3959	Younger kids could always just grab them not knowing what it is and go watch it in there room	14
18335	3959	Horrible music is just as bad, because they can listen to it and get their bad language from the @CAPS1	15
18336	3959	If parents don't want there kids growing up to be bad people then I advice all parents to keep the worse @CAPS2 away from children and hide them all	16
18337	3959	They can always hide them in the rooms, in a desk draw for child safety	17
18338	3959	Have all kids stay away from offensive and bad items they are not aloud to be around	18
18339	3959	Magazines are bad to look at if they have pictures not neccasary for children	19
18340	3959	Watch all children around the magazines or look at the magazines before allowing them to read it	20
18341	3959	There @MONTH1 be disgusting pictures that children can not see that young	21
18342	3959	So make sure they all stay clear and far away from them	22
18343	3959	I would keep all items away from young children at all times, if they are not good	23
18344	3959	Just watch all children around magazines, movies, and music	24
18345	3959	All of these materials, all children can learn bad habits from	25
18346	3959	If they are not offensive then don't worry about them getting them to watch them, because it wont be bad	26
18347	3959	They all want to live a life sometime and act like they are adults	27
18348	3959	So, sometimes you have to treat them like an adult	28
18349	3959	Yes, make sure all books, music, movies and magazines all stay away from young children if they are offensive	29
18350	3959	Movies needs to stay away from children because they can learn bad habits from the shows, music needs to stay away from young children because they can learn bad language, and magazines needs to stay away from young children also because they can look at bad pictures they arn't suppose too.	30
18351	3960	In a way many books are put on the library shelf for a reason	0
18352	3960	Some of the books take race, sexism, bullying, ect., to extreme	1
18353	3960	Putting myself in a child's shoes when they read those books, magazines, movies, music, ect., would have to be scary	2
18354	3960	The languages in movies and music are not what we think they are	3
18355	3960	Would you want your child, that's @NUM1, to go out and do what the other @NUM1 year olds do because they think it is cool for others to do	4
18356	3960	Remember back in the days when you were young and your parents didn't have to worry about what you were doing because your generation wasn't like the generations now	5
18357	3960	Well, these generations to come will probably get worse if we don't do something about it now	6
18358	3960	Taking some books off a shelf, or taking profanities out of a song will not hurt a child or teenager one bit	7
18359	3960	These things are telling your children it is ok to have sex, smoke, drink, or even cuss	8
18360	3960	I know that my mother worries about me @NUM3, because she's always calling me to check up on me and asking how my day was, or if i had any problems today	9
18361	3960	If we work together on taking care of all of the profanities then i bet the world would be a much safer and nicer place	10
18362	3960	Bullying wouldn't be a problem anymore	11
18363	3960	neither would cyer space or the drugs and alcohol	12
18364	3960	You need to step up and show your children that doing those things are not exceptable or nessesary in any life	13
18365	3960	Remember them that there is a whole life out there without the sex, drugs, and profanities	14
18366	3960	So, the next time you think that your going to buy a dvd or a cd preview it before you buy it	15
18367	3960	Make sure that if your child listened to it that it wouldnt be hurtful or have any profanities in it	16
18368	3960	Make sure that you talk to your child about what is right and wrong	17
18369	3960	Lets make these profanities go away on their own	18
18370	3960	If they aren't something you want your child to listen to then you shouldn't listen to it either	19
18371	3961	Browsing for a book at your local library that you've read, wanting to reread @CAPS1 to enjoy the sounds of its words again	0
18372	3961	You look shelf after shelf, not locating @CAPS1 anywhere	1
18373	3961	You searched everywhere, by everything that the book would possibly be listed under	2
18374	3961	You've browsed paper backs, hard backs	3
18375	3961	eventually letting your frustration take over.Giving up on locating the novel, you walk over to the librarian and ask about @CAPS1	4
18376	3961	She replies with, 'I'm sorry, we had to remove that particular novel due to a person finding @CAPS1 offensive to them.' You're infuriated, you decide to write a article to your local newspaper about the outrage of the books, movies, music, etc	5
18377	3961	that has been taken out of your local library	6
18378	3961	Personally, I don't think that the media taken away from the library should be considered offensive	7
18379	3961	How can you consider what is offensive and what is not	8
18380	3961	A book could be offensive to one person, but not another	9
18381	3961	Different people have different opinions, and @CAPS1's not reasonable to remove a book or other type of media from a library because @CAPS1 contains 'offensive material.' @CAPS1's ridiculous	10
18382	3961	@CAPS1 infuriates me that someone would do that	11
18383	3961	If you think @CAPS1 could get into the hands of a child, or someone that @CAPS1 would effect, do not rent the item	12
18384	3961	That's why at most libraries, there are seperate areas for adults and children so that children don't obtain these items	13
18385	3961	How can you determine if something is offensive	14
18386	3961	I personally don't find a lot of things offensive, but just because something is offensive to me, doesn't mean I will request to have @CAPS1 banned so that other people can't enjoy @CAPS1	15
18387	3961	If you find something offensive, just leave @CAPS1 alone	16
18388	3961	Don't bother, annoy, or hassle someone else that had nothing to do with its creation with @CAPS1	17
18389	3961	@CAPS1's not only disrepectful to the individual you file a complaint to, but the artist who created @CAPS1	18
18390	3961	You do have the right to voice your opinion, but sometimes, @CAPS1 doesn't have to voiced	19
18391	3961	We live in such a closed-minded world	20
18392	3961	We have people who don't even think @CAPS1's approprite to show one's arm	21
18393	3961	I can see why some people take offense to these things, but honestly, @CAPS1's mediocre to report something just becuase you do not agree with @CAPS1	22
18394	3961	We have a vast knowledge of what's right or wrong, what is or is not appropriate for an audience to hear	23
18395	3961	If @CAPS1 weren't appropriate, you honestly think @CAPS1 would have been published	24
18396	3961	Sure there are things in book, music, etc	25
18397	3961	that are inappropriate, but to be so closed-minded to have something banned for use of foul language, minor sexual content, or violence is unlogical	26
18398	3961	You can find worse, hear worse, just by walking down the street just about anywhere	27
18399	3961	To answer the question bluntly, no, I do not think that media should be banned just because @CAPS1 is offensive	28
18400	3961	We as @CAPS2 have the right to speak our voice, from two different perspectives	29
18401	3961	You can argue if something is mediocre, is offensive	30
18402	3961	I will argue back, just because I have the right to voice my opinion as you do	31
18403	3961	These reasons that enjoyable media are banned, such as language and violence, add emphasis, meaning, emotion, and make the reader dig for so much more in a book, song, etc	32
18404	3961	These are how the authors see their work, they want to show the people what they see, even if @CAPS1 does offend someone else.	33
18405	3962	Imagine that a person comes up to you and says, '@CAPS1 is that you are reading there	0
18406	3962	Wait, I know that book	1
18407	3962	That book is absolutely offensive	2
18408	3962	How dare you read that!' Then, imagine that they snatch that book up, and you never see it again	3
18409	3962	This is an example of how censorship works	4
18410	3962	If the government notices citizens in our country with offensive magazines, books, movies, or music, is it right for them to grab it away	5
18411	3962	No, not in any way do they have a right to do that	6
18412	3962	Everybody should be able to decide for themselves @CAPS1 is right or wrong to	7
18413	3962	watch, read, or hear	8
18414	3962	Nobody has to be exposed to anything that they don't want to	9
18415	3962	Also, if a person truley wants to find an offensive form of entertainment, they will find it, no matter if it is legal to or not	10
18416	3962	Therefore, I believe that trying to stop people from this is a fruitless action	11
18417	3962	Remember when you would get to listen to your favorite bedtime story, '@CAPS2 The @ORGANIZATION2'	12
18418	3962	Well, you can't read it anymore, the government declared the book offensive to camels and took it away	13
18419	3962	Now, you have only a boring book on facts about camels	14
18420	3962	@CAPS1 fun is that	15
18421	3962	And I have to think, '@CAPS1 about the authors?' @CAPS4 thing that is amazing about our country is our freedom of speech and expression	16
18422	3962	Stopping all that creativity from our author is tough and cruel	17
18423	3962	Writing a great story is near impossible to accomplish with limitaions that could result from government censorship	18
18424	3962	If a song is beautiful and sweet, but contains @CAPS4 bad word in it, is it a bad song	19
18425	3962	If there was censorship, who would decide @CAPS1 is appropiate	20
18426	3962	Would the @CAPS5 decide for us	21
18427	3962	Or would the @ORGANIZATION1 get together and read aloud the books before they were declared inappropiate	22
18428	3962	Personally, I would love to decide for myself	23
18429	3962	And, as a mature adult, I can	24
18430	3962	I have the morals and the mind to choose for myself @CAPS1 is good or bad	25
18431	3962	Perhaps, the multitude of books and songs that we have now would disappear altogether	26
18432	3962	It is possible	27
18433	3962	It is incredibly difficult to imagine the entire country having the same moral opinions on our entertainment	28
18434	3962	This could cause a number of entertainment forms to be eliminated	29
18435	3962	So, how can we create a standard to approve these forms of entertainment	30
18436	3962	Understanding that there are young, fragile children, that are privy to all forms all public entertainment, some censorship @MONTH1 be required	31
18437	3962	However, I strongly believe that this should be limited	32
18438	3962	The censorship should be used only to help the kids	33
18439	3962	This is similar to the way a parent has their children eat healthy food instead of junk as they are growing up	34
18440	3962	When the kids are grown, they decide for themselves @CAPS1 food to eat	35
18441	3962	Some of the items I believe should be censored are	36
18442	3962	public commercials, children's television shows, and children's movies	37
18443	3962	The things I, and many others, believe should be censored are	38
18444	3962	profanity, violence, and offensiveness toward race, religion, and gender	39
18445	3962	Later, these children will be able to chose for themselves @CAPS1 they think is acceptable, and the censorship can end	40
18446	3962	Total censorship is bad	41
18447	3962	Each and every citizen has the right to read whatever they please to	42
18448	3962	And nobody should ever try to take that away	43
18449	3962	Please, don't ever let people tell you your own morals.	44
18450	3963	Many Libraries today have limits on what they can put on their shelves	0
18451	3963	Yes, their is offensive material out there in the world but, its just artists triing to make a name for themselves	1
18452	3963	If we start controlling each others thoughts, feelings, and artist ability where will that get our culture that is rapidly expanding	2
18453	3963	Libraries should not have the right to censor material	3
18454	3963	One way to appeal to everyones demands would be to divide the library into two major sections childrens and adults and then you could contiue dividing sections	4
18455	3963	Doing this would be cost-effective and adding a   age limit in the adult section so no noisy children could get into there would be nice	5
18456	3963	It would help making finding a book easier for finding that right book	6
18457	3963	Censorship is defined as taking out a paticular item, thats either offensive to a certain group or is banned	7
18458	3963	If someone took out @PERSON2's @PERSON3 statue and other peices of work, we wouldnt get where we would be today	8
18459	3963	If you take out material you never know where it could go or lead someone	9
18460	3963	Censorship holds back many artists true potential	10
18461	3963	Limiting someones knowledge could hurt that persons chance at becoming something in this world	11
18462	3963	I have read many books that are both offensive in ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence and their is no difference	12
18463	3963	Many things interest different people	13
18464	3963	The author Katherine Paterson's quote explains this all to well if someone has a right to remove a book from the shelf than everyone has a right to remove a material off a shelve and so there would be no books left	14
18465	3963	Censoring something not only hurts the person who created it but hurts everyone else	15
18466	3963	Libraries should not censorship any material	16
18467	3963	Censoring material hurts everyones yearn for a open mind or a better understanding of something	17
18468	3963	As Katherine Paterson's quote goes 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	18
18469	3963	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	19
18470	3963	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 explains that if one person has a right to take a material off a shelf than everyone else has that right	20
18471	3963	Censorship shouldnt be in libraries.	21
18472	3965	Dear @CAPS1,                    To @CAPS2 Or @CAPS3 To @CAPS2     @CAPS5 it wrong to ban a book	0
18473	3965	It has come to my notice that this @CAPS5 exactly what our library has just thought about doing to any books, music, movies, magazines, etc	1
18474	3965	that any person finds offensive	2
18475	3965	To this I disagree	3
18476	3965	The world @CAPS5 a better place to live, when everyone has a level playing field	4
18477	3965	Some information @CAPS5 sensitive, but that same information should never be blocked completely for nothing more than just the @CAPS6 itself	5
18478	3965	Our country @CAPS5 based on a freedom of press and speech, to deny that @CAPS5 to deny our livelihood as a country	6
18479	3965	To solve a situation as this, we must all create a type of checks and balances system to keep the information out there, but also protecting it from younger ones until the time @CAPS5 right from a guardian's viewpoint	7
18480	3965	Our country has many problems, but a few of them are @CAPS3 the core values that are upheld in the @CAPS6	8
18481	3965	In the @CAPS6 it @CAPS5 stated that we have the freedom of press and speech	9
18482	3965	This means that we can publish anything, no matter the inappropriateness of the matter	10
18483	3965	This also protects any reader from being denied the right to have information at their fingertips	11
18484	3965	There was just an example of this, inside the @LOCATION1,when a local library had to allow any person wanting to look up porn on library computers because of the laws stated in the @CAPS6	12
18485	3965	However much some @MONTH1 dislike the thought of this much freedom, we cannot ban works purely based on the discretion of some	13
18486	3965	The world @CAPS5 a contantly changing place, with almost nothing a given constant	14
18487	3965	This @CAPS5 the exact same for information of all types	15
18488	3965	No one can say what will or won't be accepted in our society in the future	16
18489	3965	At this moment many sexual subjects are quite offensive to many and are viewed unacceptable to the younger generation	17
18490	3965	The only problem with this @CAPS5 the ease at which this type of information can be gotten	18
18491	3965	The internet @CAPS5 the very place where so much information passes through, be it good or bad	19
18492	3965	To block all of this information just can't be done, but to restrict it @CAPS5 our only hope	20
18493	3965	To to create such a restriction, our library can needs to have a type of checks and balances sytem that could allow those with orderly consent or those of age to get a hold of these types of works	21
18494	3965	Those of age @NUM1 or older could easily be allowed into sections containing these works, but those under @NUM1 would have to have a guardian's consent before allowed in these sections	22
18495	3965	A perfect example of this would be off of '@CAPS10 @CAPS11 and The @CAPS12 of @CAPS13' when @CAPS10 @CAPS5 @CAPS3 allowed in the restricted section of the library unless he has a signed pass from a teacher	23
18496	3965	That type of protection would still allow the works to be released to the public, but still keeping the younger generation from having any freedom to look at inappropriate items for their age	24
18497	3965	As humans we crave information, whether it be via watching, listening, or reading	25
18498	3965	To block any part of this experience @CAPS5 to block our full potential	26
18499	3965	Many things are offensive, but then again much of life @CAPS5 offensive	27
18500	3965	Our founding fathers knew this and took it with them while writing the @CAPS6, and now we have a @CAPS6 that protects all our information	28
18501	3965	This @CAPS5 a very good thing, but some things need to be upheld from those too young to understand the meaning of them	29
18502	3965	We need to protect our freedoms, but also protect our children	30
18503	3965	To do this we must create a program that allows those that want view what they want, and those that are too young view what they are allowed by their guardians.	31
18504	3967	What is offensive	0
18505	3967	How do we know what offends people, I mean everyone is different, everyone has their own thoughts a beliefs	1
18506	3967	So how are we suppose to know what offends who	2
18507	3967	The things that I would find offensive would be racial discrimination, gender discrimination, or religious discrimination	3
18508	3967	Those types of things would offend most people I think, but you can never be to sure	4
18509	3967	Books will always be books though and you can not tell people what they can and can not write or publish, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech	5
18510	3967	People will always say what they want but not everyone can get what they want	6
18511	3967	People need to come to sence and understand that consept	7
18512	3967	If a book, magazine, song, movie, or any other type of writen or vocal recording offends some one then do not read, listen to, or watch that item	8
18513	3967	No one can make some one watch or listen to something that offends them	9
18514	3967	People will always have a choice to do what they want in most cases	10
18515	3967	Books, songs, movies, magazines, and many other things will always offend atleast one person in the world we live in, but to be honest do we really care if it offends people if that is how we feel or believe	11
18516	3967	So I believe that if it offends a person then they will not take it off the shelf and if they do then that is their own personal problem people can not tell others what they can or can not write or record, it is their life let them live it.	12
18517	3968	Isn't there a saying in the world called its a free country	0
18518	3968	I thought it wasthere are alot of things that people should not see in the world	1
18519	3968	But we find ways to see it anyway no matter what it is the world has so many sources to get the truth or maybe even lie's to the world we live in	2
18520	3968	From the media to the press to poparasi maybe even from the people around you they all help the cause of things that should not be being seen by the people	3
18521	3968	There thing's out there that we the people don't know nothing about that the goverment and world shields from our eyes	4
18522	3968	Then there's the things that we are showin by the world like @PERSON1 alot of people think what happend to him is offensive	5
18523	3968	Not only that but racisim in general also the news why would people put violent things on the news like murder storys and kidnapping and robberys and many more	6
18524	3968	People find that offensive and even scary to alot of people but yet we keep it on there	7
18525	3968	So no i don't think it should not be removed from shelves and or were ever all things found to be offensive to people are located	8
18526	3968	Just like when that marine died and gay supportors and protestors were near his funeral chanting with (offensive) thing's	9
18527	3968	Say thank god for dead soldiers and god hates the army	10
18528	3968	Nobody stopped that	11
18529	3968	If we as people are not going to come togeather and work with one another about the things that should or should not be displayed then whats the point of telling someone else what is offensive to you when your going to end up doing it to	12
18530	3968	And your going to do it with out a care in the world not thinking about who your hurting 	13
18531	3968	Everyone has and opinion and wants to demained it but people are diffrent and some will always see it diffrent than what you see it	14
18532	3968	So if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside	15
18533	3968	Dont watch it dont read it dont try to hear about it from a friend or stranger leave it alone	16
18534	3968	We put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave it alone	17
18535	3968	And then you wouldnt have even known about it	18
18536	3968	Live life and dont worry about the negative lets focus on the positive of what you see.	19
18537	3970	Almost everyone has a movie they would like to see, or a book they would like to read	0
18538	3970	What happens if they take a trip to the library, and check the catalog, only to find out it had been removed from the system because of bad language or mild themes	1
18539	3970	I believe that people should be able to choose what content they decide to read and let their children read	2
18540	3970	Some parents don't allow much offencive material at all while others don't mind it	3
18541	3970	Also the books and movies for adults are different than children books and movies	4
18542	3970	It would not be fair to remove offencive books, music, or magazines, from the shelf because different people like different content	5
18543	3970	Today, we live in a world of violence and it is going to be hard to avoice violence and offencive material	6
18544	3970	For some people, they want to avoid it at all costs, while others don't care or they like it	7
18545	3970	First of all, different people consider the same content differently, and the titles being removed @MONTH1 not be judged fairly	8
18546	3970	The people who want to see the latest movies that just came out, are usually going to see some type of violence	9
18547	3970	With more advanced computers and technology, there can be more special effects and move violence added to movies easier	10
18548	3970	In books, they @MONTH1 have old language that isn't up to the standards of today	11
18549	3970	For example, in the @NUM1 and @NUM2, when the word 'gay' used to mean happy	12
18550	3970	It is a whole different word now and it is a lot of old books and songs	13
18551	3970	Some people @MONTH1 find that offensive and some @MONTH1 not	14
18552	3970	Adult content is very differnt than children content	15
18553	3970	Adults have movies and music based on real life situations and stories while most children content is based on the alphabet and sing alongs	16
18554	3970	There are also the more grown up kid movies like @ORGANIZATION1's '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 one is based in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1 training to be a hero	17
18555	3970	During his fights, he kills the creatures that he fights	18
18556	3970	So if the libraries started censoring mateirals, then a classic @ORGANIZATION1 movie would be considered violent	19
18557	3970	The adult movies are worse in every way	20
18558	3970	They involve cursing, killing, gun battles, and sexual content	21
18559	3970	I'm not going into any further detail about adult movies	22
18560	3970	Being an adult, one should have the choice of what they are going to watch and the judge of what they are going to let their children watch	23
18561	3970	Different people like differnt content and it is only fair for them to be the one to decide what they watch and consider violent	24
18562	3970	An example one person might grow up around a farm and be used to seeing animals killed, while one who grew up in a neighborhood has never seen an animal killed	25
18563	3970	When they both see the movie or read a book with an animal killed, it will have hardly an effect on the one from the farm compared to the likely painful effect on the one from a neighborhood	26
18564	3970	Think about a gun battle scene of a movie or a death in a book	27
18565	3970	A soldier who is in the army will take killings and seeing deaths much easier than a @CAPS4 of a company	28
18566	3970	As stated before, different people prefer differnt types of content	29
18567	3970	All in all, I don't think there should be any censorship on library content	30
18568	3970	It should be up to the parents to make the choice of what they are going to let their childern watch or read	31
18569	3970	Adults can also be the judge of what they let themsleves watch	32
18570	3970	Lastly, again, different people like different content and it's not fair for one to choose what another can or can't watch	33
18571	3971	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed	0
18572	3971	I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense, they should still be left there	1
18573	3971	They are apart of our history and the history we're creating	2
18574	3971	If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine, there's a big chance they will end up reading it	3
18575	3971	There are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today	4
18576	3971	You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the computer	5
18577	3971	Also, censoring in libraries, where everyone feels tranquil and comfortable, can make people rebel and even put the library out of business	6
18578	3971	From what i've observed, most people look up inappropriate or offensive things on the internet already	7
18579	3971	Especially if they know that it's something that could be debated about being censored	8
18580	3971	A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics	9
18581	3971	Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them	10
18582	3971	Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested	11
18583	3971	Everyone should have the right to these books, magazines, movies, and music	12
18584	3971	Libraries should not censor them.	13
18585	3972	Libraries are full of all different sorts of books, movies and magazines	0
18586	3972	These books, movies, and magazines @MONTH1 come across as offensive to some people	1
18587	3972	Parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies	2
18588	3972	Does this mean we should take thoughs offensive books off the shelf	3
18589	3972	If everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf, there would be nothing left in the library	4
18590	3972	Books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need	5
18591	3972	Young Children need books to help their imagination grow	6
18592	3972	If there was not anymore books in the library, children would not be able to learn or grow	7
18593	3972	Movies are just like books but for young children it is easier to visualize a movie rather then a book	8
18594	3972	If the book or movie is found offensive to you, pick another, but it should not be removed from the shelf	9
18595	3972	One book or movie @MONTH1 seem offensive to you, but @MONTH1 not to another person	10
18596	3972	A world without books	11
18597	3972	No imagination	12
18598	3972	No adventures	13
18599	3972	It would be a boring world	14
18600	3972	I would rather have a few offensive books then none at all	15
18601	3972	That way I can learn and see character's adventures through my own eyes	16
18602	3973	Would you remove a book from a shelf just because it offends you	0
18603	3973	If you said yes, how is that any different than a white boy saying i can't learn with this black girl in class with me	1
18604	3973	Or if two people with different religions yould say he or she offends me because we dont believe in the same god	2
18605	3973	Just because someone is offended by book or wrighting does not mean it should by removed form the shelf	3
18606	3973	In fact if they dont like it they dont have to read or even look at it	4
18607	3973	That is one freedom we have in america is to read anything we would like to	5
18608	3973	For someone to take anything off of a shelf that is open to the public is taking away their freedom	6
18609	3973	In conclusion it is not okay for anything to be takin off of a public shelf no matter who in offends	7
18610	3973	It is a right we have as american's to read or wright anything we would like to, And removing offencive meteral would be taking away our freedom	8
18611	3975	I do believe that libraries should censor certain materials	0
18612	3975	Some things like music and magazines have bad language and racey pictures in them	1
18613	3975	Some parents might not want there kids to be exposed to this	2
18614	3975	Some parents might not know what their child is looking at in the library and wants them to be safer	3
18615	3975	The easiest way to prevent children from listening to innappropiate music or looking at offensive books is to take them off the shelves	4
18616	3975	Some children go to the library without adult supervision and have freedom to check out whatever book they want	5
18617	3975	The child could easily pick out an innopropiate book and read it because there is no parent there to guide them	6
18618	3975	There is nobody to tell them what is wrong and right so some kids might not know	7
18619	3975	Thats why some books and music should be removed	8
18620	3975	If you do not remove innappropiate books and music from the shelves you would have to have an attendent	9
18621	3975	The attendent would have to walk and around and check out what each individual kid is doing	10
18622	3975	It would be a lot of busy work and the libriarians are aready busy enough	11
18623	3975	Nobody really wants to do that so the simplier solution is to just remove the books and music from the shelves	12
18624	3975	Another opition if you do want to keep the music and books on the shelves is to have an age limit on the books and music to check them out	13
18625	3975	If this were done it would still lead to problems like kids reading the books at the library but never checking hem out	14
18626	3975	This is an easy way to get around the system	15
18627	3975	A child could easily ask an older friend to check the book out for them, so they could read it later	16
18628	3975	This is another example of how easy it would be to get around that system	17
18629	3975	Therefore, the easiest way to aviod problems with books and music is to remove them from the shelves	18
18630	3975	If this were done it is harder for the children to get the innopropriate books and music	19
18631	3975	If somebody needed to check out an innappropiate book for any reason, they could go someplace else	20
18632	3975	This is the best and most efficient way to protect and keep everyone safe	21
18633	3976	Censorship	0
18634	3976	Have you ever been looking for a book and not being able to find it	1
18635	3976	Have you ever gone to a library and the magazine you were looking for was behind everything else on the top shelf	2
18636	3976	Well if you have, you have experienced censorship	3
18637	3976	Censorship is where things are sheltered from the the light of day	4
18638	3976	A specific place of censorship is with books and magazines at libraries	5
18639	3976	Most people today are worried about offensive things on and in books or magazines	6
18640	3976	A big question I ask is why	7
18641	3976	Well I can tell you why	8
18642	3976	Most people of today are too afraid of what other people think	9
18643	3976	Everything and everyone has to be perfect	10
18644	3976	I strongly disagree with this because if someone writes a book, they should not be afraid to put something in it because of what other people have to think about it	11
18645	3976	If they do not like it, then do not read it	12
18646	3976	I do not think that things should be sheltered from libraries because sometimes it can get a point across to some people	13
18647	3976	If there is a article up on a shelf and it has an appealing image on it, you are going to stop and read it 	14
18648	3976	If it has a good message to send to you will think about it	15
18649	3976	Then once you have thought about it, you will make your own opinion on what that article said	16
18650	3976	If you have a positive opinion you might go pick that magazine up and read it	17
18651	3976	If you have a negative opinion on what it said then you will not even look at the next time you go by there	18
18652	3976	If you think that something is too bad for eyes of other people then so be it	19
18653	3976	That is your opinion and you have all of the right to it	20
18654	3976	I will not dislike you for your opinion and I will not look at you any differently	21
18655	3976	The only thing I hope is that I got my point across to you.	22
18656	3977	I do not believe there should be censorship in our libraries	0
18657	3977	By censoring our libraries, they're censoring us	1
18658	3977	This is supposed to be a democracy, not a dictatorship	2
18659	3977	A good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the @PERSON1 books just because they use the 'n word' and some people find this offensive	3
18660	3977	The thing is, this is how they talked back then, this is just the way things were	4
18661	3977	People can't just rewrite books because they don't like the history behind them	5
18662	3977	They can change all they want, but in the end it still happened	6
18663	3977	We recite history so we don't make the same mistakes again, and this is a good example of it	7
18664	3977	Music shouldn't be censored	8
18665	3977	Music is a form of expression, and by censoring the music, you're censoring the artist	9
18666	3977	They say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do	10
18667	3977	We're supposed to have freedom of speech, so now why are we getting these freedoms taken away from us just because a select few deem it inappropriate	11
18668	3977	We don't make anyone listen to anything they don't want to	12
18669	3977	Each generation has it's own style and music, has it's own problems and ways to deal with them	13
18670	3977	our generation is music, so let us express ourselves	14
18671	3977	Movies are censored due to language and content, which I get, but actually removing them from our libraries should not happen	15
18672	3977	If the audience is mature enough to handle it, they should be able to watch it	16
18673	3977	We don't need to take out curse words or remove inappropriate scenes just so childern can watch them	17
18674	3977	If they are really that bad, they don't need to watch them period until they are mature enough to handle it	18
18675	3977	Magazines should be censored in the same way as movies, by maturity level and age	19
18676	3977	I agree there are some movies that are inappropriate, but taking out articles just because someone in charge doesn't like what's being said is wrong	20
18677	3977	We can't just block out all the bad things that are happening in the world and just pretend nothing's wrong because the stories aren't being told	21
18678	3977	People deserve to know what's going on	22
18679	3977	People deserve to read, watch, or listen to anything that they want	23
18680	3977	By censoring things, they're only going to make us search to find them, therefor making it kind of like a reward to get to see the things others find so inappropriate that they're willing to go out of their way to get rid of them	24
18681	3977	You can't please everyone, so just elt us make our own decisions	25
18682	3977	Censoring our libraries is like censoring us	26
18683	3977	We have our constitution, we know our rights, now why are people nowadays thinking they can change them	27
18684	3977	They can't keep us dumb by hiding things	28
18685	3977	We're still going to find them, they're just going to make it like a game of tag	29
18686	3977	so let the game begin	30
18687	3978	In the words of the author, Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
18688	3978	But if I have a right to remove that book from the sheld---that work I abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
18689	3978	And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 are countless books in the world which will offend someone in one way or another	2
18690	3978	If everyone were to expect their feelings to be accounted by everyone, they are mistaken	3
18691	3978	Everyone has a right to discover the thoughts of others as long as they keep in mind they @MONTH1 not always be pleased with the outcome	4
18692	3978	Certain books carrying harsh opinions or uncencored material can be found on every shelf	5
18693	3978	As my many years as a student, I have come to find books containing vulgar images and language	6
18694	3978	@PERSON1's play '@CAPS2' describes him in very crude ways	7
18695	3978	Our class was very surprised at the language and sexual innuendos involved	8
18696	3978	@CAPS2 was described as a 'black ram' by his nemesis	9
18697	3978	Comments such as these in books can mold a young mind into thinking name calling is appropriate	10
18698	3978	Unfortunately, this is how children are to learn the nature of select authors and the world outside the classroom	11
18699	3978	@PERSON1 also discusses a 'strumpet' in '@CAPS2'	12
18700	3978	Once a mind is aware of such adult matters they will look at the world completely different	13
18701	3978	Life must be hard for children as their books and magazines show racy pictures of girls and advertisements for products	14
18702	3978	Magazines are a threshold of adult matters	15
18703	3978	Once a teenager or child view all the vibrant advertisements and beautiful models selling products, they begin to lose a sense of reality and childhood	16
18704	3978	The photoshopped images of tall, tan, and thin models make a girl's head ponder that way of life	17
18705	3978	They begin wearing shorter skirts, dieting, and tanning all because of an ad they saw in their magazine	18
18706	3978	Who wouldn't want to be like a model	19
18707	3978	When every actress, singer, and model begin looking like godesses, the men picture the perfect girl as the ones they see on billboards	20
18708	3978	After the men picture the ultimate female as the images they see, the women will never be able to add up to their qualifications	21
18709	3978	A whole cycle of being underappreciated and the obsession to be perfect makes the media more powerful	22
18710	3978	In conclusion, the world has become absorbed in the unrealistic fantasies racy books and magazines provide	23
18711	3978	Crude comments are found in classics and are a powerful influence on the mind	24
18712	3978	Advertisements in magazines cause a sense of worthlessness in women and the feeling of unfulfillment for men	25
18713	3978	Are you going to control you're life or let the media?	26
18714	3979	Kids today have a whole lot of options of books they can or cannot read in the schools library	0
18715	3979	The things they cannot read are censored	1
18716	3979	School systems have good reasons why they censor some book, and I agree with the cooperation	2
18717	3979	The facts on why books are censored in a school campus is to much racil slurs, profanity, and unaproperit situations	3
18718	3979	How many schools have books that have racism in it	4
18719	3979	Racism happens in books all the time	5
18720	3979	In fact one out of fifty books contain racism	6
18721	3979	The big book is '@PERSON1' fin by @PERSON2	7
18722	3979	It recently got banned from schools all over the @LOCATION1	8
18723	3979	People all around the world are trying to teach their kids what to say and what not to say	9
18724	3979	Kids pick up some bad language from the books they read	10
18725	3979	Even though some of these books still lay on the shelves of the schools	11
18726	3979	It is up to the kids not to read them	12
18727	3979	Uniproperit situations is why schools only order some sports illustrated magazines	13
18728	3979	The school librarians don't want the kids looking at any nudity or violent scences in the books	14
18729	3979	Do you say to blame them	15
18730	3979	I believe that the schools and parents are doing the right things	16
18731	3979	It is up to the kids to make the decision to listen or not listen to their parents	17
18732	3979	I believe censorship is a great thing for @CAPS1 youth.	18
18733	3980	People out there have the right to descide weather or not there childs books have censorship in it	0
18734	3980	Some parents dont want there child to read books like that till they get older	1
18735	3980	Kids in grade school dont know the book they are getting has profanity in it	2
18736	3980	I think that in all grade schools and middle schools should have no books that have censorship in them	3
18737	3980	Yea some parents dont care what their child reads	4
18738	3980	Think about the ones that do	5
18739	3980	Not every one has the guts to say something to the school	6
18740	3980	If you ask me i would not but books with censorship in them in my childs school	7
18741	3980	Then again the high school students are old enough to look threw the books and descide if they want to get that book or not	8
18742	3980	Yea some parents still care about their child when they get into high school but high school students are old enough to make their own descions	9
18743	3980	Some students @MONTH1 not relize what book they grabed untill they start reading but thats when they turn around and exchange it	10
18744	3980	I think high school students are smart enough to choose their own books	11
18745	3980	This is why I think bout the books and magazines etc	12
18746	3980	with censorship should be removed from the grade schools and middle schools and not high schools	13
18747	3980	If you agree YOU can do something about it	14
18748	3980	Talk to your childs school	15
18749	3981	Remain on the Shelf	0
18750	3981	Certain materials such as books, music, magazines and more can often contian offensive information that many would want censored	1
18751	3981	The people writing the items are not making them so that they are just plain offensive, the way people take in information is the main factor	2
18752	3981	People choose whether or not to believe certain things for themselves, and with those come their personal opinions	3
18753	3981	Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive, this could create more problems with the public and those who disagree on what has been taken out, that dont consider them to be offensive	4
18754	3981	What is offensive to one person, @MONTH1 not be offensive to the next	5
18755	3981	Items being removed because of a complaint made by one person should not even be considered	6
18756	3981	Whether it be a book, magazine, or music the author had a purpose for it and it was not intended on hurting someone's feelings	7
18757	3981	For example, a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man, but a black man would consider it to be about his history	8
18758	3981	People can find many things offensive by just reading titles, or listening to one lyric from as song, but that does not mean they have to read the book or keep listening to the song	9
18759	3981	Someone else is enjoying the book and the song could be what another person looks forward to everyday	10
18760	3981	These magazines and books could also be seen as informing	11
18761	3981	The material in a certian magazine @MONTH1 not be acceptable by some, but a lot of new information can come from them	12
18762	3981	If everything found offensive was removed from the shelves there would most likley be nothing left	13
18763	3981	Removing them could cause choas to someone who is trying to learn more about a disease, when another person who is suffering from it does not want their story told	14
18764	3981	Certian materials being offensive can only offend so many, and chances are what doesnt offend them offends the next person	15
18765	3981	Informing articles and books should not be removed from shelves in libraries because they are there just to provide a source of knowledge	16
18766	3981	Censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested	17
18767	3981	A lot of people like to read and rent movies just for fun, but chances are if the book or movie does not sound interesting, it is not going to make any profit	18
18768	3981	What is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another	19
18769	3981	From my experience teenagers are interested in alot of action and romantic films and books	20
18770	3981	They often times contain alot of physical and sexual content along with a decnt amount of foul language	21
18771	3981	A older person would not be interested in the foul language and content, they would consider them to be offensive to either the girl or boy in the story and would wonder why it is even being read	22
18772	3981	Most would even say that the books and movies can be degrading to some, but it is what interests teens and makes them want to read more becasue they can't wait to see what is going to happen next	23
18773	3981	Removing items such as these would push teens away from reading and viewing alot of movies because nothing then would spark their interest	24
18774	3981	Scenes and facts in materials that could be offensive to a person are usually not intended to be	25
18775	3981	People are not being made to read and watch what offends them	26
18776	3981	Everybody is different and what offends my neighbor @MONTH1 not offend me	27
18777	3981	Chances are that there will alwasy be something that is going to offend at least one person	28
18778	3981	The more we all get used to it , the less many people will actually run into items that offend them	29
18779	3981	They @MONTH1 still be offended on the insided but it won't matter because they will have realized that not everybody is offended by the same thing	30
18780	3982	Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if found offensive	0
18781	3982	Censorship can be a huge deal depending on who you ask or where you go some find it necessary so kids do not get into these things found in librarys or some @MONTH1 not think it's so important	1
18782	3982	Books are important parts of peoples lives, learning, etc, they are also read for many different reasons but some of the topics books are written about @MONTH1 not be right or could be innapropriate or possibly against all of someones beliefs or religion	2
18783	3982	I personally do not think that censorship is necessary to keep some things out of librarys just some thngs shouldnt be available for anyone to just walk in and pick up off of a shelf in a library maybe materials that are innapropriate for children or people @MONTH1 find offensive should be kept away in a different secluded section of a library and be clearly labeled of what the purpose of this room is so people will clearly know and won't really risk the chance of just stumbling upon those materials	3
18784	3982	Another reason why censorship @MONTH1 not be necessary is that things that anyone could find in the library that @MONTH1 be offensive or innapropriate can be found just as easy if not easier on @CAPS1 or on the internet by anyone anytime of the day	4
18785	3982	@CAPS1 has some censorship but not enough to remove the effect that @CAPS1 show or movie or internet site could have on the minds of todays young people and children such as violence, drugs, language, and racism that is found in almost everything today	5
18786	3982	Todays children and young people should be taught of whats wrong even if they do think it's dumb or unecassary at the time when they mature they hopefuloly will see whay they were taught those things and why they should always try to stay away from things that are seen in movies, magazines, books, and mostly on @CAPS1 and not get involved with these activities	6
18787	3982	Censorship I still believe is not necessary even though I know of all the innapropriate and harmful things in todays culture	7
18788	3982	Even though I know how harmful it can be if they see the effect it could have on their future and what it has done to other people that saw things in movies, books or even heard it in music if they could see and hear from people who have been affected by these things they would know to stay away from bad things and go along with whats right	8
18789	3982	In conclusion censorship is not necessary, it could be in the future but if everyone is lead to what is right they will hopefully make the right decision and stay away from harmful books, movies, music, magazines, and other things alike.	9
18790	3983	You Are @CAPS1 You @CAPS2	0
18791	3983	Censorship is a touchy subject in our society today	1
18792	3983	People ask, '@CAPS3 much should be censored?' or even 'Should @CAPS9 be censored at all?'  @CAPS4 opinion is that censorship should be left up to the parents of the children that are reading, listening to, or watching materials	2
18793	3983	Television networks and reading companies, including publishers and libraries, can't possibly take the place of a parent	3
18794	3983	I believe that if a parent is not responsible enough to care @CAPS1 the child is reading, the distrubuters of the materials can't be punished	4
18795	3983	In @CAPS4 experience, @CAPS4 mother has taken part in censoring me from offensive materials from a very young age	5
18796	3983	She is always interested in @CAPS1 I am reading	6
18797	3983	Occasionally, she will glance over a book or reading material herself in order to deem it appropriate for me to @CAPS2	7
18798	3983	@CAPS4 mother has also censored @CAPS4 music by glancing through @CAPS4 music player and every so often, playing a song or two	8
18799	3983	@CAPS9 discourages me from listening to anything that @CAPS4 mother wouldn't approve of	9
18800	3983	I have also experienced censorship in @CAPS4 local library	10
18801	3983	The library is divided into sections, begining with the children's books	11
18802	3983	These books are appropriate for young minds and have no offensive material	12
18803	3983	@CAPS9 section leads to young adult, then eventually the adult books	13
18804	3983	The music is also similarly divided into these catagories	14
18805	3983	I believe @CAPS9 is acceptable because there are certain materials and music that a young child should not be exposed to	15
18806	3983	Through reading the book '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' by @PERSON1, I have observed that parents need to have some involvement in @CAPS1 their children are reading, listening to, and watching	16
18807	3983	In @CAPS9 book, @PERSON2's parents simply left him alone while he was in his room	17
18808	3983	They let him listen to his own music, and watch @CAPS1 he wanted	18
18809	3983	@CAPS9 led him to listening to a @CAPS7 metal band called '@CAPS7 @CAPS8.'  @CAPS9 band influenced him to commit a homocide in his school, killing ten students	19
18810	3983	@CAPS9 is a worst case scenario in which censorship was not practiced at all	20
18811	3983	Violence can have a large impact in young kids	21
18812	3983	therefore, they shouldn't be exposed to it until they are mature	22
18813	3983	Through @CAPS4 reading, I have taken the position that the government does not have the right to impose censorship on the whole population	23
18814	3983	The novel '@CAPS10 @NUM1' is an example of censorship being taken to the extreme	24
18815	3983	Reading is banned in their society, except for comic books and sex magazines	25
18816	3983	@CAPS9 shows that without a right to @CAPS2, society is reduced to very simple, uneducated creatures	26
18817	3983	Censoring an entire people's reading is impractical	27
18818	3983	@CAPS4 opinion is that once a person is an adult, they have the common sense and maturity to @CAPS2 whatever they choose	28
18819	3983	Censorship is difficult to take a stand on because ther are so many posatives and negatives to consider	29
18820	3983	@CAPS4 position on @CAPS9 vital subject is that parents should be the ones censoring their children's reading, not the government or the reading companies	30
18821	3983	Once a person is an adult, their right is to choose whatever they like to @CAPS2	31
18822	3983	Reading is a magical thing that should not be held back from adults who are prepared to experience it to its fullest	32
18823	3983	As long as society keeps a balance between the outcome of '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' in which censorship was not practiced, and '@CAPS10 @NUM1' in which it was enforced to the fullest, I believe that we have reached an appropriate balance	33
18824	3983	Censorship is healthy for children, but restricting in adults.	34
18825	3984	Many people think that libraries should be censored in one form or another to keep certian types of book away from people	0
18826	3984	How does that really help	1
18827	3984	Even if you remove certian book or music from a library doesn't mean people won't still get that same information from somewhere else	2
18828	3984	Besides many of the things that people should be censored is probably not that bad	3
18829	3984	I think it is better for some one to read about somthing the have it happen to them and then experince it	4
18830	3984	Like Katherine Paterson said if we let people get rid of book of music that they think are bad for people to read or listen to what will we have left	5
18831	3984	Nothing	6
18832	3984	Through people think censorring libraries is for the greater good, it just has too many bad side to have much of a good effect	7
18833	3984	When people try to censor things they normally just take things off of shelfs and get rid of them	8
18834	3984	But, in today world of technology that doesn't stop people from obtaining there goal	9
18835	3984	We have the internet that lets people upload book and music to share	10
18836	3984	So yeah, you many not be able to get a book at the library but you can almost always find it online	11
18837	3984	In result trying to censor libraries by removing books and music really is doing anything	12
18838	3984	How do you determine what should be censored	13
18839	3984	People all have a different idea of what is ok for the public and what is not	14
18840	3984	Some book that get removed could insult a group of people because it related in some way to them	15
18841	3984	Then you loss business and make poeple mad at the same time	16
18842	3984	In some way isn't it better for people to learn about bad things like crime and death through ways that aren't real and don't hurt	17
18843	3984	When things like that happen in a book they normally don't just stop there	18
18844	3984	They show the results or how the situation was handled	19
18845	3984	Which could come to help people who end up in the same sort of situatuions later on it there life	20
18846	3984	Which makes it really hard to determine what should be censored and what shouldn't	21
18847	3984	Katherrine Paterson even said that if we let people censor what they think is unmoral nothing will be left	22
18848	3984	Everything will be gone, because every person in the world would find something is every book that they could find bad	23
18849	3984	Even if there is a book that people agree should be censored, there are people that think the other way	24
18850	3984	No books would be left if we  censored libraries because people could find thing bad or unmoral in every book	25
18851	3984	Overall, censoring libraries ends up being more pain than it worth	26
18852	3984	It is not stoping people from obtaining the information another way	27
18853	3984	There is no way to decide what shuld be censored	28
18854	3984	And, censoring somethings will lead to people wanting other things to be censored, which will leave nothing	29
18855	3984	In conclusion, censoring doesn't really stop people and ends up leading to bigger problems in the end.	30
18856	3985	Dear Newspaper staff, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is @PERSON1 I @CAPS3 to @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 I am in the @NUM1 grade	0
18857	3985	The reson for this letter is that I belive that certain material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc	1
18858	3985	Should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive	2
18859	3985	The reson why I think it should be done because kids know days minds be every where from pron to games to bad music etc	3
18860	3985	In @CAPS7 books, magazines, movies, have things in it that shouldnt be in there	4
18861	3985	When kids get a hole of it they act like they anit never seen nothing like it	5
18862	3985	When they get on the computer they get on web sites that they know they are not suppossed to be on	6
18863	3985	If we didnt have these things we wouldnt have to worry about the loud music, the virus on the computer and the books being riped up	7
18864	3985	But know a days there are so much stuff people can do to get all of things	8
18865	3985	If someone just removed all the things that are found offensive from the shelves	9
18866	3985	That would be so wonderful for everyone	10
18867	3985	If they leave all the materials out there its going to be more and more problmes	11
18868	3985	When they just take it off everything will be in grate shape	12
18869	3986	What is the extent of reading that should be read by the public world	0
18870	3986	There are so many different types of reading and music that many people enjoy as a hobby	1
18871	3986	Books have been around for centuries and can create a whole new world for readers	2
18872	3986	The latest gossip can be found in many magazines	3
18873	3986	Music is sometimes said to help people cope with life problems	4
18874	3986	Movies can open up peoples' imaginations and make them feel emotions for a theme of no importance	5
18875	3986	All these things make up peoples lives	6
18876	3986	Without any of these enjoyments what would people do with their free time	7
18877	3986	Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off shelves	8
18878	3986	They're huge factors that make up the society and make life what it is	9
18879	3986	Books and magazines are two fun things people love to read	10
18880	3986	Fiction or nonfiction	11
18881	3986	No matter if books are real or fake they create stories that interest people	12
18882	3986	Reading is a hobby that's been around since the beginning of times	13
18883	3986	There are many different selections in reading, for example, adventure, mystery, comedy, or love stories	14
18884	3986	People will always read no matter what	15
18885	3986	Most books read are the ones that are sad and sometimes gruesome, but those are the stories that draw people in	16
18886	3986	Magazines are often picked up when going into the check out line in a grocery store	17
18887	3986	People love to read gossip, and learn about the latest trends	18
18888	3986	Magazines provide a type of self enjoyment for people	19
18889	3986	When reading a juicy title, most people can't help themselves but to pick up the magazine and learn what's going on in someone else's life	20
18890	3986	Music is used for so many different things	21
18891	3986	It's often listened to when driving down the road	22
18892	3986	Many people fall asleep to soothing instruments that make a beautiful melody	23
18893	3986	Lyrics in songs relate to common people and at times it can help a person through a rough challenge	24
18894	3986	There is something about the different beats songs make that can change peoples' moods	25
18895	3986	On most @DATE1 nights, it is always seen that movie theatre's are very crowded	26
18896	3986	Movies bring out imagination and stories where people can watch and follow along	27
18897	3986	When watching a movie with a sad ending, most people cry	28
18898	3986	Although not always real, it touches people on an emotional level	29
18899	3986	Movies can bring things to life	30
18900	3986	Life is what it is from contributing factors	31
18901	3986	All people think differently and like unsimilar things	32
18902	3986	Books, magazines, music, and movies all relate to peoples' likes and dislikes	33
18903	3986	Taking things off the shelves because they are offensivc or don't alway make people feel good, won't make our world any better of a place	34
18904	3986	If anything it will take away happiness in the world	35
18905	3986	These things make people feel different in ways that can't be described	36
18906	3986	Most often things that are offensive is the truth	37
18907	3986	Why hide things that are real	38
18908	3986	What would writers, musicians, and actors do if they couldn't do something just because it could offend a couple people out of millions	39
18909	3986	All these things are comfort for some people	40
18910	3986	Books, magazines, music, and movies make the world and everyday life what it is	41
18911	3986	They are simple things in life, but once gone they are a huge gap missing	42
18912	3986	Things are fun and creative because of books, magazines, music, and movies	43
18913	3986	In my own experience books make me interested in subjects, magazines fufill my want for reading about celebrities, music makes me feel happy when I am sad, and movies make me feel like I can feel the same emotions as the characters do.They should not be taken off shelves just because they are offensive, they are part of life.	44
18914	3987	In this essay I am going to write about the books about the librabries	0
18915	3987	Also if they are books that can be offensive and that it can or not be removed by the libraries.I think that the libraries have the right to have any materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more on the shelves	1
18916	3987	Well in my opinion I think that they should not remove any books because people @MONTH1 think that it can be offensive but other people @MONTH1 be into those books	2
18917	3987	So no I don't think they should remove any because some people have different opinions on different books.When I go to libraries they are books that I can enjoy reading or not like but that is just my opinion	3
18918	3987	Some people might like the book that I did not liked or hate but I think that the books should not be removed from the shelves because some people might enjoy it and some won't.I think they should not remove books because the books are for people that are interseted on the books that they want to read or learn about the stuff about the past or just fiction books.I just talked about the essay I just wrote I talked about the books about the libraries, and how some books can be offensive to other people that are trying to pick books, and also if they should or not remove books from the shelves	4
18919	3988	Books are an extremely important part of literature	0
18920	3988	Many different people have different views of different kinds of books	1
18921	3988	Some people enjoy books, and some people don't	2
18922	3988	Some people are fast readers, and some people aren't	3
18923	3988	Reading is in individual task	4
18924	3988	Your reading abilities, interests, and preferences are different from everyone else's	5
18925	3988	The main idea here is preferences	6
18926	3988	You @MONTH1 enjoy a certain genre or topic that someone else @MONTH1 find offensive	7
18927	3988	But just because someone else doesn't enjoy it, does that meant that you shouldn't be able to enjoy it for yourself	8
18928	3988	Just because it is in the library, doesn't mean you have to check it out	9
18929	3988	Just because it is the new release in the book store and everyone loves it, doesn't mean YOU have to buy it	10
18930	3988	Other people can avoid the topics that they don't like	11
18931	3988	For example, if the local library took out all of the books that had anything to do with drugs and alcohol, because they found them offensive, the fact that they took the books out, could be offensive to the other people who enjoyed them	12
18932	3988	Also, some things could be offensive to some people that could be critical to research for others	13
18933	3988	Then, some people @MONTH1 not have the resources available that they need	14
18934	3988	If it is music, movies, or magazines, then it should be dealt with the same way	15
18935	3988	People have a choice of what they want to buy and rent	16
18936	3988	If a certain artist or actor is offensive to them, they should find something else and leave that @CAPS1 or movie for someone else to enjoy	17
18937	3988	They shouldn't complain about it	18
18938	3988	How would they feel if someone found their favorite band's music offensive and then no one could rent it from the library or buy it anywhere	19
18939	3988	Then, people would understand that everyone is different in their own way and not everyone will enjoy what they do	20
18940	3988	I think that knowing that everyone is different and special in their own way should show that, everyone is going to enjoy different things at different levels	21
18941	3988	Every book, movie, @CAPS1, magazine, and any other thing, should be left for people to enjoy and hopefully you can find something you enjoy too	22
18942	3989	People of the world @MONTH1 always find something they think is offensive that others don't	0
18943	3989	In this case I think that if it is in a public library they do need to watch what they put on the shelves	1
18944	3989	If some little kid grabs a playboy from the youngster's section, the library is probably going to get sued	2
18945	3989	Libraries are supposed to be a place where people can get a book to read or to look up some information about any school-work they have	3
18946	3989	Books about anatomy are an exeption but if that library has a book like sex for dummies then something needs to @CAPS1 in that facility	4
18947	3989	Movies too, if somebody wants that kind of material they need to go else where to find it	5
18948	3989	Exposing those kinds of movie clips and images could be harmful to the children of future @LOCATION1	6
18949	3989	If our world crashes as we know it because kids couldn't find the correct information needed, then that shows that we deserved it	7
18950	3989	What kind of movies we watch, advertisement we pay attention to, what music we listen to most, and many other things are what make people who they truly are	8
18951	3989	People these days read magazines that can be completely harmless but come with an ad	9
18952	3989	that says @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or All @CAPS4 @CAPS5, these are found in a lot of magazines like @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and sometimes @CAPS8	10
18953	3989	These ads	11
18954	3989	are totaly uncalled for	12
18955	3989	If people looked into this more, than they do we wouldn't have to fight this as much	13
18956	3989	These things that people find to be offensive are harsh and cruel things to show our young readers, writers, and musicians	14
18957	3989	These type of things influence kids to do this type of stuff that americans and non-americans find so offensive	15
18958	3989	So libraries be aware of what you put on your shelves and be aware of the consequences.	16
18959	3990	Censorship is a tough topic to discuss	0
18960	3990	Everyone has different views on what is and isn't acceptable in libraries, because of the content in some books, music, movies, and magazines	1
18961	3990	When you start to censor what information is available to certain people, they get angry, and it can cause an uproar of protest	2
18962	3990	There should be an age limit on some materials however	3
18963	3990	So how can you tell what is okay for younger children and teens to view	4
18964	3990	For movies, music, and magazines, there are already limitations on how old you have to be to buy or rent them	5
18965	3990	With movies, the rule in libraries should be the same as anywhere else	6
18966	3990	It should be that you must be seventeen to get anything rated @CAPS1	7
18967	3990	I'm not sure what the age is to view unrated movies is, but for libraries it shoulld be the same as anything else	8
18968	3990	Anything else, should be open to all ages	9
18969	3990	Music is also a controversial material to censor	10
18970	3990	If a @CAPS2 has an explicit label on it, you should have to be eighteen to check it out	11
18971	3990	The reason being, is that some music can contain violent lyrics, and unless you are eighteen you shouldn't listen to it	12
18972	3990	When you hear music that is offensive to you, you must be smart enough to not listen to it	13
18973	3990	Anything any artist wants to say on a @CAPS2 can be recorded, and children should not be exposed to that until they are responsible enough to know what they should, and sometimes shouldn't be listening to	14
18974	3990	Printed materials are the hardest to censor	15
18975	3990	Personally, i don't believe any book should be kept from anyone	16
18976	3990	The only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines	17
18977	3990	Once again, magazines can contain some graphic content, and should only be kept from anyone under eighteen	18
18978	3990	There are just some things kids shouldn't see, but if you are a legal adult, and want to read any kind of book, it should be available to you	19
18979	3990	With any of these materials, it should all be available to you in a library	20
18980	3990	It is a place to learn about how a writer, a movie director, a music artist, or magazine editor feels about the world	21
18981	3990	If we censor the material in a library, it is denying the public of the real world	22
18982	3990	Also, we would be revoking the right given to us of free speech	23
18983	3990	I do not make fun of books because I know whatever someone writes down, in their eyes, is the truth	24
18984	3990	It is an expression of self, and to stop someone's work from being available to the world, you are taking away the right of free speech.	25
18985	3991	Magazines and Books     I am writing an essay on should we take books, magazines, or movies off the shelves if they have bad language or have violant roles in it	0
18986	3991	First thing we should discover is how many people like books, movies, or music like that	1
18987	3991	@CAPS3 me personally like books that have violance and graphic language in them @CAPS3 that just makes the book so much more interesting	2
18988	3991	And when it comes to music their parents need to be very careful what they let their kids listen to	3
18989	3991	And @CAPS1 boadcasters need to watch what they put on the air @CAPS3 some of it can be pretty bad for a kid to watch	4
18990	3991	The second thing is, is it ok for kids to be reading these kind of books	5
18991	3991	I dont think it would be ok for a kid under fourteen to be reading about violance or hearing words that are graphic	6
18992	3991	But its not up to me they need to take a survey on the moms and dads of these children and see what they think about it	7
18993	3991	@CAPS3 it is up to them if they want there kid listening to or reading material like that	8
18994	3991	And its also up to the childrens parents what kind of music they listen to	9
18995	3991	@CAPS3 there is more cerse words in the @DATE1 than there has ever been in the history of music and the same goes for books and magazies	10
18996	3991	Magazines sometimes can be pretty graphic when it comes to picures.me myself dont really look at magazines @CAPS3 they dont really intrest me I would rather sit down and watch what ever it is on @CAPS1	11
18997	3991	Then the third and final argument is how could we make our libraries in american more censored for kids	12
18998	3991	I think the libraries shoul have different rooms that have different types of book in them	13
18999	3991	@CAPS3 if you just have a library that anybody can go and pick up any book that they wanted then kids are going to go straight to the funny books or the books that are not suitable for kids to be reading	14
19000	3991	They should make it so you have to be a certain age to check out a book that has bad language or that has graphis pictures or that just are not suitable for children	15
19001	3991	That is why I think that books need to get into the right hands and not into kids hands	16
19002	3991	Kids dont need to know bad language at their age @CAPS3 that is a bad habit for a kid to learn then they will go to school saying them	17
19003	3991	And reading books that talk about beating somebody up or murder mikght get it in a little kids head that that is ok	18
19004	3991	And that is not ok with me	19
19005	3992	Cursing, violence, gang activity, murder, ect	0
19006	3992	All of these  are factors found in our books and music we have today	1
19007	3992	Do you believe these items should be cencered	2
19008	3992	If books or music have these types of messages in them it is going to influence children and adult's choices on what they do in life	3
19009	3992	I feel that, yes books and music should be cencored	4
19010	3992	My first supporting reason of why books and music should be cencored is the fact that children and adults get a huge influence from the information	5
19011	3992	Look in today's world	6
19012	3992	murders are happening, gang violence, and even abuse	7
19013	3992	If a book or song is advertising about murdering some one, or selling drugs nine times out of ten people think that is the 'cool' thing to do so why not do it	8
19014	3992	With people following uncencored books and songs it leaves dead people, inmates, and poor choices	9
19015	3992	Most people want to follow what an artist or author is doing because they are famous, which is causing peer preasure	10
19016	3992	The second reason books and music should be censored is the simple fact of respect	11
19017	3992	Some books or music affends people by their race, religion, or their apperance	12
19018	3992	You find most of the critizisium from music more than books, but it does occur	13
19019	3992	Young children and teens shouldn't listen to or read about racism, sex, how to drugs, ect	14
19020	3992	Books and music that have advertisment about these types of things is disrespectful to parents and what they teach their children	15
19021	3992	The message brought from the book or song is basically saying go against your parents and do this	16
19022	3992	A person should be able to sit and listen to a nice song, or book without getting disrespected and offended	17
19023	3992	My final reasoning for books and music being cencored is the reputation it will have or has	18
19024	3992	Books and music are just like people, they can send off the wrong message leaving a bad reputation upon others	19
19025	3992	For instance, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 tend to have a lot of bad messaged songs, so therefore most people think that all @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are bad	20
19026	3992	If songs and books were cencored there wouldn't be a sterio type against a certain type of music, or books have the best message	21
19027	3992	A normal person bases the first song, or book they hear/read by if or not they or their child can listen to or read that type of material	22
19028	3992	Love, positive messages, influencing good, these are the types of things most people want to hear or read	23
19029	3992	If books and music are cencored there will not be any more cursing on the radio, bad ideas given to those influenced, and could stop less violence	24
19030	3992	Again I state, yes I feel books and music should be cencored.	25
19031	3993	I do not think they should be removed at all	0
19032	3993	They show a persons opinion on something	1
19033	3993	We can't just disregard it because we dont like what its saying	2
19034	3993	Thats like us saying black people aren't allowed here because we don't like how you look	3
19035	3993	Or just anyone that we dont like how they look	4
19036	3993	I think anyone who wants to speak their mind should be able to without having to worry about censorship	5
19037	3993	I @MONTH1 not agree with all the statements they bring up but they should have a fair chance like anyone else would	6
19038	3993	You should restrict to age accordingly to content so you don't have little kids reading about stuff they really shouldn't be	7
19039	3993	I could get a book removed because it offends me	8
19040	3993	Well then I could get a franchise closed because it offends me	9
19041	3993	People are offened by little things and should jut except the fact that other people have different opinions	10
19042	3993	It's just like judging a person for their race	11
19043	3993	They have differnt morales and values and you can't just change that in a person	12
19044	3993	Like if you don't like this article just don't read it	13
19045	3993	Don't say other people can't read it because of your views	14
19046	3993	I don't think there should be censorship.	15
19047	3994	There are many opinions on censorship in libraries	0
19048	3994	Some people believe that if books are offensive in any way that they should be removed, while other believe that these books should stay since there are different opinions on what is classified as 'offensive'	1
19049	3994	I believe that books should remain on shelves due to the fact that all people view things differently and its free will that allows people to pick up these books	2
19050	3994	No one if forcing them to read them	3
19051	3994	I believe when books, music, movies, and magazines publish offensive material that it is just a matter of opinion	4
19052	3994	I feel that people have different perspectives on what they find appropriate	5
19053	3994	For example, a magazine article containing information about the wrong doings of the political offices or a cartoon of a certain candidate	6
19054	3994	Some poliliticians might find this article offensive and take it as a jab towards them while others see it just as an opinion on the matter	7
19055	3994	Another example would be a book on religious purposes	8
19056	3994	For instance, a book on an @CAPS1 religion	9
19057	3994	Some @CAPS2 might take it as offensive if the informations paints them as being a certatin stereotype, but others @MONTH1 see it as educational learning	10
19058	3994	I also feel like this somewhat goes along with the idea of free will	11
19059	3994	No one can force a person to not read a certain book or listen to a certain song	12
19060	3994	It's free will that allows us to read, listen, and watch whatever pleases us	13
19061	3994	I feel that if someone was to go and demand that we take a book off a shelf that takes away from a person's free will who @MONTH1 be coming to rent the book that day	14
19062	3994	Its up to an individual to decide on what they will read and what their take is on the matter	15
19063	3994	I also feel that these types of media should remain on the shelves because of learning and educational purposes	16
19064	3994	I believe that even though some of these books or movies might have a couple of offensive lines or phrases that does not mean the whole thing is offensive	17
19065	3994	I think that the library is a place where people can go and research information	18
19066	3994	Some of the material found @MONTH1 be offensive to a certain person but that does not cancel out the rest of the book and mark it as being 'wrong'	19
19067	3994	I think that we must decide on what we believe is right in books and tune out what we feel is offensive or else many informational books would not be available today	20
19068	3994	The library is a place where our free will comes into play	21
19069	3994	I feel that the offensiveness in books, music, movies, and magazines are all based on personal opinions and that they should never be removed from libraries	22
19070	3994	These books all contain information that could be veiwed in different ways and that it is up to the public to decifer for themselves what is offensive and what is acceptable	23
19071	3994	I believe that no one should decide for us	24
19072	3995	Can you think of a book that you hope none of your children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
19073	3995	But if you had the right to remove the book would you	1
19074	3995	I believe if I found a book, magazine, any type of  music, or a movie offensive I would not remove it, because everyone has a right to their own opinion, even if it is offensive	2
19075	3995	Also, instead of removing the materials completely, why not remake them into a more suitable manner to where they are less offensive	3
19076	3995	First, noone should have the right to remove materials they find offensive	4
19077	3995	Because if people were allowed to do that the world would have no music, books, movies, magazines or anything to intertain ourselves	5
19078	3995	Also it would start a big fight because alot of people do not find certain things offensive like other people do, and when the people that find materials offensive start removing things that other people dont find offensive, a big riot will start	6
19079	3995	secondly, why would you start removing materials if it could be remade into a more suitable manner	7
19080	3995	maybe instead of removing everything, why not find the publisher and see if the could make it @NUM1 or less vaulger	8
19081	3995	Same with music, movies, and magazines	9
19082	3995	So to conclusion everyone has a right to their own opinion, no matter if it is offensive or not	10
19083	3995	I think if i came across something that offended me I wouldnt do anything about it	11
19084	3995	Because maybe that person who wrote the book, or movie was expressing how they feel, and you can not tell someone how to feel or express themselves	12
19085	3995	So instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do	13
19086	3996	Empty @CAPS1     @CAPS2 is it wrong to censor	0
19087	3996	In the world there are today there is about @NUM1 billion people	1
19088	3996	All these people make up diffrent groups with diffrent moral codes, ethics, beliefs, and out looks on the world	2
19089	3996	With this in mind, there comes a problem with what is wrong and right	3
19090	3996	The three subject that will be discused in this article will be censorship, expression, and society	4
19091	3996	To be censored puts a lable on things that says this article is not fit to be seen, or heard by anyone	5
19092	3996	Censorship was made to protect people from raw material that is seen as unfit or cruel	6
19093	3996	Music is censored for the subject or matter it speaks about, wether it would be of sex, drugs, or poltics	7
19094	3996	This goes for movies, magazines, newspapers, televison, or other forms of media	8
19095	3996	the reasons that somethig is censored changes from place to place	9
19096	3996	Expression of ones inner thoughts of the world or a genral area could be desaterous in the eyes of some	10
19097	3996	To others, expression gives the chance to see who could be the next @CAPS3 vinci, @PERSON1, or anyother great thinker of the world	11
19098	3996	Censoring these people can and would be horrible	12
19099	3996	The idea that just beacuase someone has a diffrent out look does not mean they are the evil that is in the world	13
19100	3996	True their work could cause a problem, but their idea should not be shuned by the world	14
19101	3996	The material they produce should be aloud to be seen by anyone of any age	15
19102	3996	Society possess a big problem	16
19103	3996	Society or how one should act in public is diffrent all over the world	17
19104	3996	So therfore what is censored here would not be censored somewhere else	18
19105	3996	This also mean what is wrong or right is diffrent to everyone on earth	19
19106	3996	The society will have great effect on with is aloud to be seen or heard by those that live in the society	20
19107	3996	if the society disagrees with the ideas of something the society will have it banned	21
19108	3996	If this is let to continue nothing will be aloud to speak its mind on anything	22
19109	3996	So @CAPS2 is censorship wrong	23
19110	3996	Censorship is unjust to those with ideas unlike others	24
19111	3996	If someone can censor someone else then that person that is being censored could in turn censor the person that is censoring them because of that persons veiws	25
19112	3996	So yes it is wrong to censor anything or anyone for thier ideas, morals, ethics, rules, laws, beliefs, or conduct	26
19113	3996	Everything should be aloud to exsist and be seen or heard by anyone who wants to look into that subject of matter	27
19114	3996	In conclusion censorship, expression, and society will always have veiws but none of these view should ever be hiddin from anything or anyone.	28
19115	3997	If content in a library is considered offensive, @CAPS1 should still remain on the shelf regardless	0
19116	3997	Perhaps the media would prove inappropriate for many, but select few will still value the media for what @CAPS1 is	1
19117	3997	Taking one kids cake because @CAPS1 has to much frosting would anger most kids (and adults).If a book, album, movie or a magazine is known to contain offensive or inappropriate material @CAPS1 should remain organized with the rest of @CAPS1's kind, not exiled in the furthest corner	2
19118	3997	When one checks out such media @CAPS1 they should be required to state they are comfortable with the fact that their media might contain inappropiate and/or offensive content.I personally find @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or in the context of a song, @ORGANIZATION1 fascinating	3
19119	3997	Every time i look up these poems i have to accept an agreement that I am comfortable with @CAPS1's violent or hateful content	4
19120	3997	Although, I do agree @CAPS1 should not be readily available to anyone looking for something new to read(or listen) without their consent.I believe that simply asking the costumer if they are comfortable with a form of media's content would prove suffice	5
19121	3997	No one wants to settle for less or no frosting, and they should not have to.	6
19122	3998	Some materials could be seen as offensive to some people	0
19123	3998	It could have language, racial slurs, or anything else one might find offensive	1
19124	3998	In my personal opinion I believe anyone should have the right to read or watch whatever they choose	2
19125	3998	These books or movies are put out there for entertainment or learning purposes	3
19126	3998	Some things did happen, such as the @LOCATION1, that many people would like to forget but no matter which way you take it, it happened and we can't change it	4
19127	3998	This can teach the next generation that it was a bad idea and should not have happened in the first place, so they will not do it	5
19128	3998	Language is a big part of today's world and many do not appreciate a bad word	6
19129	3998	They put these in movies to emphasize somthing big because everyone will remember that word	7
19130	3998	I know that it is not necessary all of the time and could be taken out, but for some movies a certain word could make or break the scene	8
19131	3998	Some movies have a lot of cursing in them but that does not make it a bad movie	9
19132	3998	A few of the best movies I have ever seen have too many bad words to count but the stroy line is phenominal	10
19133	3998	What you gain from watching those movies is not the cursing, it's the success of the protagonist that makes it enjoyable and worth your time	11
19134	3998	As for books in libraries, we should make a seperate section for these offensive materials so that a young, innocent child does not wonder across them	12
19135	3998	Put up signs warning people of the material contained in that section and put a speical sticker on the book to warn parents as well	13
19136	3998	In conclusion, offensive materials are not always bad and should not be removed from shelves, just mabye to a different location	14
19137	3998	Let the people read what they want to read.	15
19138	3999	As far as opinions go, everyone has one	0
19139	3999	Only in certain situations are people's opinions actually taken seriously	1
19140	3999	When it comes to a debate on serious situations such as 'censorship', there will be an arguement for those who agree and for those who disagree	2
19141	3999	Agreeing to a cause such as 'inappropriate book removal' in ones opinion shouuld not be omitted.	3
19142	3999	At the ages of children, teens, and young adults, their minds are very curious	4
19143	3999	If interested in something they will go out and seek information for it if the adult does not provide proper information to what is asked	5
19144	3999	Books, magazines, newspapers, novels, etc are public reading materials that are meant for everyone to see	6
19145	3999	Hiding it would be like robbing them of their right to be informed	7
19146	3999	Not all reading materials are dangerous to the mind and eyes of the youth	8
19147	3999	The issue is how the parents raised them to embrace knowledge that they see	9
19148	3999	A maturity level must be high enough for that child to be able to understand what it is they're looking at	10
19149	3999	It would  be useless for the adult to hide things from them until the age of @NUM1, when they are legally obligated to consume any sort of knowledge	11
19150	3999	The easiest way would be for the adult and child to have a sit-and-chat session for better understanding	12
19151	3999	Removing novels and books from libraries publicly or even at school would do nothing more than just raise the childs curiousity level to the highest extent	13
19152	3999	This, some would believe, would persuade the child to go out and experience it first hand so that they know what it is, and later in life know what to expect	14
19153	3999	Doing so would, could, and @MONTH1 be harmful and dangerous depending on the act made by the child	15
19154	3999	When the simplist solution would just be approving that child to read and be educated	16
19155	3999	Therefore if one person out of millions dislike a book becuase they feel it can greatly influence one child to do the wrong thing, then another child who try and keep their self away from it can't be taught because someone had a deep abhor for it and decided that it was outlandishly inappropriate for someone, much as a child, to read	17
19156	3999	To agree to removing information form the library is absoulutely purposeless, and @MONTH1 be an inconvenience for someone whom @MONTH1 have been determined to research something	18
19157	3999	With all honesty, books and novels were made for a reason	19
19158	3999	That reaason is to entertain, inform, and educate	20
19159	3999	By  removing every source all those who agree to the cause should also agree to the fact that they have no remorse for the outcome of how their child grows up and become someone they never wanted them to be.	21
19160	4001	In all libraries you are offered a choice on which book you would like to choose	0
19161	4001	So if you want to read a book with no censorship or if you want censorship then you can	1
19162	4001	The libraries should not take away books because of the content, in my honest opinion it should be the readers choice and not someone elses	2
19163	4001	When choosing a book you have to think, do I really want to read this	3
19164	4001	each book gives you a little description on the back of the book giving you a little inside so you can tell if you would like to read the book or not	4
19165	4001	I do believe if it has sugested content that you should not let little kids read them but at a high school level we pretty much are able to make choices for ourselves	5
19166	4001	Music should not be censored because if  a song says something that you dont want to hear like cussing or sugestive content then just turn the station	6
19167	4001	You dont have to sit and listen to the song, you can change it with a click or push of a button	7
19168	4001	Songs that are on the radio are for enjoyment and entertainment so you made the choice to go to that station and listen to the music that is on it, you made the choice and nobody can make it for you	8
19169	4001	With movies they have a description on the back that tells what is going to be in the movie and what it's rated, if you don't want to watch a moive with bad language or bad content you should not have chose the movie in the first place it is clear as day on the case what will be in it	9
19170	4001	On movie cases it even gives you pictures of certain scenes and if they seem a little sugestive then put it back and select a differnt movie	10
19171	4001	Magazines are meant to tell the truth and sometimes the truth is hard	11
19172	4001	Magazines are stocked on shelves in stores and on the front will tell you exactly what is in the magazine itself	12
19173	4001	If you are really bothered by certain language thumb threw the magazine and see if it is approprate or not for you	13
19174	4001	Libraries should not have to get rid of books just because some content, a person who walks threw those doors should be aware of what is in the library and what exactly they will find	14
19175	4001	In libraries they have catagorys in which certain topics are under, by going towards a selection it is saying that you understand what type of book it will be	15
19176	4003	First, libraries are a good source of information	0
19177	4003	At the same time a library can have pros and cons to its information	1
19178	4003	Some information should be only seen by adults	2
19179	4003	Have you ever wondered what if a child got their hands on an adult book	3
19180	4003	What's one way we can stop this	4
19181	4003	Next, you can find information about everyday life	5
19182	4003	Through magazine, movies, music and books are ways you can find them out	6
19183	4003	You have explicit music where the artist curses, and says inapropriate things	7
19184	4003	There has been books from my past experiences where an author just talked about her sex life	8
19185	4003	I have a past experience with magazines too, such as '@CAPS1'	9
19186	4003	All these have to stay out of libraries or put in a section where children can't reach them	10
19187	4003	Third, parents should monitor their children when they go to public places anyways	11
19188	4003	The library should be divided into different parts	12
19189	4003	Music isn't really necessary at a library	13
19190	4003	They could throw the music out	14
19191	4003	Also, at the same time children shouldn't get their hands on the books but they would have to learn about that stuff in life eventaully	15
19192	4003	The committee should have a contest in which people of any age of the community could write an essay telling their opinion also	16
19193	4003	Finally, I've came up with a plan to fix this situation	17
19194	4003	I personally don't think they should throw these books out because this is how people make a living and some people actually like these things	18
19195	4003	So they should set up an adult section in the library where you have to be @NUM1 or older to enter and a identification card to prove it	19
19196	4003	Also, you must have a membership to that department	20
19197	4003	That way we don't have to worry about censoring these books, etc	21
19198	4003	Children will not be able to proceed in this section	22
19199	4003	In conclusion, libraries are a good source of information	23
19200	4003	So they shouldn't throw these books, music, magazines and movies out	24
19201	4003	The library could just set up a different section for certain things and people of certain age	25
19202	4003	In that way they won't need censorship	26
19203	4005	People that walk the surface of our planet sometimes feel the need to have something banned or atleast get some dirt on it to make people think less of it	0
19204	4005	It is just the way our world works when it comes to something you just can't stand, but why even bother, just what exactly are they going to get out of it	1
19205	4005	If someone took the time to make it then we all deserve the right to view it	2
19206	4005	I do not agree on censorship in our world	3
19207	4005	Local libraries are a very nice place to go for books, movies, and information	4
19208	4005	How is this to be such a good resource for people once everything is gone, especially considering some of the worlds greatest books ever written are the ones that are targeted by censorship	5
19209	4005	I believe Katherine Paterson has a very valuable point in saying, 'Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' because it is true	6
19210	4005	People don't stop at just one, once something is gone they will continue hunting for things that they just hate, which will lead to people suffering from not being able to enjoy the things they want	7
19211	4005	When I was younger, I remember going to the library all the time for @CAPS1 movies and books	8
19212	4005	I personally got to actually see a book be removed because of censorship, although I did not fully understand, I felt that if I read it, I would get grounded	9
19213	4005	Which is also not good for kids because they shouldn't be scared to read something	10
19214	4005	We live in a place with the freedom of speech, but yet that right seems to be fading away	11
19215	4005	There's still more ways to see censorship and how it affects the libraries though, such as actually reading about some of the cases that have tried to ban books	12
19216	4005	Although most fail to be banned right now, the world is very unpredictable	13
19217	4005	In school there have been many times where kids got the chance to read case after case about people trying to get some of the best books banned	14
19218	4005	Which is funny how those books are the only books that were fun to read during the school year	15
19219	4005	So that doesn't make sense on why to take them off the shelves	16
19220	4005	Reading is what keeps us informed, on the past and even the future	17
19221	4005	'Then we have no books left.' if this is what people wish for then keep at it, but if there is some sort of decency in you, I would imagine when it comes to making an easy choice like this, you too would choose the right one	18
19222	4005	Saying no to censorship	19
19223	4005	Reading is what keeps us strong, entertained, and those who know the past are not likely to repeat it, unless books are gone.	20
19224	4006	Many individuals vist different libraries all over the world everyday	0
19225	4006	Some for books, some for magazines, some for movies	1
19226	4006	Everyone has different taste so a libary is where they go, because they have absolutley everything	2
19227	4006	Libraries have all kinds of amazing different books	3
19228	4006	It is where people of all ages go to find books or other materials that they would like to read or use for research	4
19229	4006	There should be no  limits on what  books, movies, magazines, ect., are on the shelf	5
19230	4006	Everyone has different beliefes/feelings on what they would like to read or see	6
19231	4006	If libraries starting limitting their options, i don't think that they would have as much business and people would not read as much	7
19232	4006	Which means that an indivudal's @CAPS1 could go down	8
19233	4006	Reading helps everyone in this world, by learning new vocabualry and just excersizing their own eyes	9
19234	4006	By taking away someone's intrest, they won't read as much, or feel as free	10
19235	4006	Just because someone doesnt like something, does not mean the next person won't	11
19236	4006	If a book or movie, ect., is offensive to someone they just just simply not read it or watch it	12
19237	4006	No one has the right to take over someones mind of what they are interested in	13
19238	4006	However limmiting the age groups for certian items would not be a horrible idea	14
19239	4006	Books that @MONTH1 be offensive or not approiate for a young child should not be aloud to be seen or checked out by a young child, but that does not mean take it away from others.	15
19240	4007	Books now an days have action, romases, and, etc	0
19241	4007	So that's why the books that are not moving off the shelf is because they don't have what other books have	1
19242	4007	So they just sit there well most of the other books that are getting off the shelf are the happy @CAPS1, The @CAPS2 side, The @CAPS3,and all of the vampor books	2
19243	4007	It's because they have action, love, and etc	3
19244	4007	The books that are on and off the shelf	4
19245	4007	Are maybe really good books	5
19246	4007	Some books don't ever leave the shelf it's probably because they are not	6
19247	4007	Really that great the reason for it is because the books that are on the shelf is	7
19248	4007	Because the book is  boring, or a old school book, they really don't have what the raeder is looking for	8
19249	4007	However the books that are really getting readers happy are the books that are from the movies like the @CAPS2 side	9
19250	4007	That book has gotten sold faster than the movies	10
19251	4007	The reason why readers like the books more than the movies is because	11
19252	4007	The books from the movies like the @CAPS2 side	12
19253	4007	Is bacuse the author gives more informotion on the movie	13
19254	4007	I heard that, that book is nothing like the movie the book is so much better than the movie because the book gives more informotion on the movie	14
19255	4007	So their for poeple really like books that from a movie	15
19256	4007	They are more reasons why poeple like books now and days	16
19257	4007	You don't have to go to a book store anymore the books are now on your iphone, ipod, itouch,ipad and a nook,etc	17
19258	4007	So now you dont have to go to a book store anymore	18
19259	4007	You can get it on you iphone and other stuff poeple are raelly happy that they dont have too get up in the morning or when ever they get they books	19
19260	4007	They can however now just get them on the go	20
19261	4007	So that is why books are now on the shelfs for good	21
19262	4007	Because you can get it on the go	22
19263	4007	But I believe that poeple whom ever like the feel of book	23
19264	4007	Should try and  just go out and get a iphone or nook something thaat saves you time while you are on your way to work or school	24
19265	4010	The library is an important place for the knowledge seeker	0
19266	4010	The library holds books of past and current writers	1
19267	4010	It also holds information on past and current events	2
19268	4010	Censorship in libraries has become an ongoing debate	3
19269	4010	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offenseive history, books, or newspaper articles	4
19270	4010	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offensive history	5
19271	4010	One reason to ban censorship in historical events is because it would create a loss of information	6
19272	4010	Periods like the holocaust, the genocide of about six million @CAPS1 by @LOCATION2, would eventually die with the generations that knew about it	7
19273	4010	The holocaust was an event that became known @CAPS2 wide during @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which was a major historical event	8
19274	4010	The slave trade would be another historical event lost to censorship	9
19275	4010	The slave trade is a major part in @CAPS5 history that helped shape the country it is today	10
19276	4010	Another reason to ban censorship in historical events would be because of their importance	11
19277	4010	If we censor certain materials we began to forget key parts of history	12
19278	4010	Keeping those historical facts poses an opportunity to teach and learn	13
19279	4010	Censorship in libraries aimed toward historical events should not be allowed	14
19280	4010	Also, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books	15
19281	4010	One reason is beacuse authors wrote their books how they intended them to be read	16
19282	4010	An example is @PERSON2	17
19283	4010	The author of The @CAPS6 of @PERSON3 and The @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION2	18
19284	4010	Both books use the word @NUM1r to convey the tone	19
19285	4010	Another examample is the author of To @CAPS7 A @CAPS8, @PERSON1	20
19286	4010	Another reason to ban censorship in books is because that's an authors writing style	21
19287	4010	The author writes a book how they want it to be read	22
19288	4010	Therefore they use the language and words of the time period they write about	23
19289	4010	@PERSON2 didn't use @NUM1r because he was racist, he used it to convey what times were like and how people talked	24
19290	4010	Censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books	25
19291	4010	Finally, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to get rid of newspaper articles	26
19292	4010	One reason is because newspapers was the way to send out information	27
19293	4010	It brought peoples attention to recent happenings	28
19294	4010	It informed people of what was going on	29
19295	4010	Getting rid of that is just another loss of information	30
19296	4010	Newpapers were key players in getting out information about @LOCATION3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the assasination of @CAPS12 and @ORGANIZATION1	31
19297	4010	Another reason to keep from censoring newpapers in libraries is because of their importance today	32
19298	4010	They continue to keep people informed of recent and also past events	33
19299	4010	An example is the death of @LOCATION1 and how he caused the deaths of many @CAPS13 on @DATE1 eleventh	34
19300	4010	Articles about views on the death penalty	35
19301	4010	Censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries to get rid of offensive newspaper articles	36
19302	4010	The library is a homestead to the knowledge seeker	37
19303	4010	There, they can read about past and current events	38
19304	4010	They can also read classics by great authors	39
19305	4010	Censorship should not be allowed in libraries to avoid offensive history, books, or newspaper articles.	40
19306	4012	My views on censorship in libraries are alike in many different ways	0
19307	4012	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive to more than just one person	1
19308	4012	If they are not that big of a problem they shouldn't be removed	2
19309	4012	People might change their mind about going to that particular library, if they find a lot of offensive things there	3
19310	4012	Also having these offensive things in libraries greatens the chance they could be read by the wrong minds, and it could possibly change how most children act, or think	4
19311	4012	A few things that I would find, that would bother me are books or magazines that contain drugs, nudity, horrible violence, and bullying	5
19312	4012	From my own experience, having books that contain these types of problems are very offensive to most parents and can effect the way you live, if you take them seriously	6
19313	4012	Some libraries don't even realize that they have these offensive books, magazines, or videos	7
19314	4012	I have had a teacher take a book away from me and I got in trouble for reading it, even though it was in the library where anyone could have grabbed it off the shelf and read it	8
19315	4012	In my opinion I think libraries should take the time and look through the books they have and decide whether or not they  are considered offensive to parents if their children were to read them	9
19316	4012	I agree with removing certain materials that contain offensive things, from all libraries	10
19317	4012	Also I believe if parents could choose they would decide to get rid of all the mean, nasty, and offensive materials	11
19318	4013	I believe that there should be censorship in public libraries	0
19319	4013	Libraries have families and young children going to them that do not need to see, hear, and read certain things	1
19320	4013	If people would like to buy inapporpriate reading material, movies, or music they can do that elsewhere	2
19321	4013	Certain things are acceptable in public libraries and other things are not	3
19322	4013	Certain material such at rated @CAPS1 movies and romance novels are not inappropriate or unacceptable	4
19323	4013	They are meant for adults but they are not showing extremely racy pictures on their covers	5
19324	4013	Other material, however, most people are not interested in having to see and our young children should not be subjected to that	6
19325	4013	People that wish to view, listen to, or read inappropriate material that is not meant for all ages or covers shouldn't even be viewed by young children can and will purchase or find them elsewhere	7
19326	4013	People that wish to possess these items will find another place to get them besides a public place with families and children	8
19327	4013	I believe these people reserve the right to view and listen to what they would like but they should be censored in a public library	9
19328	4013	Most people don't read inappropriate material in public and most extremely racy movies aren't even shown in theatres so why should you be able to check them out in a public place	10
19329	4013	Besides that many people do not even want other people to know that they are viewing these objects in the first place so many wouldn't even check them out at a public library	11
19330	4013	I also believe that not only should children not be subjected to these things but parents should not be subjected to their children wanting to know what certain things are that they are far to young to know about	12
19331	4013	The youth of @LOCATION1 is getting into new things younger and younger daily whether that be drugs or inappropriate magazines so I believe that we should not begin subjecting our children to that at an even younger age than they will already find out about it.	13
19332	4014	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
19333	4014	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
19334	4014	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 the author, Katherine Paterson	2
19335	4014	Her quote means that there might be a book, magazine, etc., on a shelf that someone shouldn't see	3
19336	4014	I beleive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	4
19337	4014	There are ways people can avoid seeing them	5
19338	4014	I think that if something is found offensive then they should be in a special aisle	6
19339	4014	First off, if there are items that people find offensive then they should be placed in a specific aisle	7
19340	4014	There are things that only adults should see so therefore there should be an aisle dedicated to the offensive or inapropriate things	8
19341	4014	And for someone to get into that aisle they should have permission to get into the aisle and show and I.D	9
19342	4014	so that kids and children don't accidently slip in and see things they shouldn't	10
19343	4014	Because if a child sees something bad, then that might influence them to do bad things because they won't know any better	11
19344	4014	Secondly, if an indivual finds a book or magazine offensive, then they can avoid it by simply walking away	12
19345	4014	That person doesn't have to read it or look for it in a library if it's in a certain aisle	13
19346	4014	But if someone is really offended by something then all they have to do is go complain to the person head of the library and it can simply be removed if there are enough compaints	14
19347	4014	Then again, it's not that hard to avoid something you don't like	15
19348	4014	It might bother you that it's there, but it should be out of the way for younger kids to see	16
19349	4014	Thirdly, the library will contain things that are found either offensive or inapropriate so children entering the library should have adult supervision so that they don't see the bad things	17
19350	4014	If a child sees something bad, they might find it interesting so they might want to pick it up and read it, which is bad because it might give them ideas	18
19351	4014	Finally, there are many ways to avoid seeing something you find offensive	19
19352	4014	You can walk away if you notice something you find offensive or you stay away from that area of the library	20
19353	4014	There are going to be many things out there that people find offensive and inapropriate, but there's not much you can do about it	21
19354	4014	The best thing to do is ignore it and walk away	22
19355	4014	And if you're that concerned about it then you can always make a complaint about what has offended you or what you think is inapropriate for children	23
19356	4014	Putting bad things in an aisle is a smart idea because little kids won't be able to access it.	24
19357	4015	Books on shelfs are there for a reason    'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
19358	4015	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
19359	4015	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson wrote	2
19360	4015	The quote in short words for me means what should and should not be allowed for children and what they should learn as children	3
19361	4015	Libraries have non- fiction and fiction books as well as magazines, music and movies	4
19362	4015	I myself like to learn a little bit of everything but of course there is things that I dont like learning when I am too young	5
19363	4015	I like discovering things on my own	6
19364	4015	There is times where I do like discovering new things because I dont know when life ends	7
19365	4015	In other words I'm surrounded by reality and have to come out of the fantasy world	8
19366	4015	Magazines also just have a lot of trouble and sometimes, yes it's life but also its just dramatic things about people     A library is a good place to learn lots of things	9
19367	4015	You can learn about the history of presidents, countries, important people music,etc	10
19368	4015	Honestly, the only thing I go there for, is to read and to check out books, but from books I have learned a lot	11
19369	4015	There is some material that shouldnt be read and discovered when your too young	12
19370	4015	Theres material that is too strong for some children and they should learn it as they grown not in a bunch	13
19371	4015	Libraries should have different stickers or labels on books for children and have a warning signs for their age	14
19372	4015	There is times where it is good to learn about life but you have to becareful because it @MONTH1 be to strong	15
19373	4015	There is books that teach you a lot	16
19374	4015	I have learned a lot from old books to new books	17
19375	4015	I don't think that the books should be removed, yes they @MONTH1 be strong, but is our owns choice to read it or not	18
19376	4015	There can be racist books, but they are there for a reason and it's not to make fun of people	19
19377	4015	Magazines also are sometimes good because they teach good things and keep you updated about whats going on around the world	20
19378	4015	There is also some magazines that just talk drama and criticize famous people	21
19379	4015	I dont think its important and to be showing other people's personal lives or criticizing it	22
19380	4015	That is deffinetly not good for children to learn at that age	23
19381	4015	Magazines shouldn't be removed because everyone else has a decision at what to read and what to look at	24
19382	4015	Music, at the library there is mostly music from like a centuries ago, but they were also great composers	25
19383	4015	No the music shouldn't be removed because everyone has a different taste in music	26
19384	4015	There's also new music, everyone has different taste and should choose what they want to listen to or who to listen to	27
19385	4015	Movies, are a big part of life, so I think	28
19386	4015	Theres a lot from them that I learn from	29
19387	4015	From slavery to the future, there are movies where I have learned a lot	30
19388	4015	There is also some videos that are rated @CAPS1, @NUM1, @CAPS2, etc	31
19389	4015	It is our choice to watch the movie without no one telling us if we should or not	32
19390	4015	There is different reasons why there are certain books, music, magazines, movies that offend people, but it also has a significance	33
19391	4015	Books are not racist so other people can be made fun of but to learn what they went through	34
19392	4015	I'm glad that I as I grow I know what to learn and when I'm to young to read something	35
19393	4015	I think it should be allowed because it's for everyone	36
19394	4015	I dont think nothing should be removed from shelves even if the material is offensive	37
19395	4016	As a fellow person of the community and a person who often vists the libray, I think that books,magazines,movies,etc., should not be taken off the shelf	0
19396	4016	The reason for this thought is because, although it @MONTH1 be offensive to one person does not mean it's offensive to another	1
19397	4016	Taking various books and items away from our libraries takes away from many peoples' knowledge of our world	2
19398	4016	This in turn makes the world illiterate	3
19399	4016	Libraries provide multiple things that are not family disscreation but, to the right age group offers alot of knowledge	4
19400	4016	Movies are a large portion of this problem but, they are there do to entertainment  reasons	5
19401	4016	I feel that all items that are equipped in a library should be looked at as a way of knowledge and not as weither it is offensive to a certain quanity of people	6
19402	4016	The removal of these things @MONTH1 become harmful to a new generation in the long run	7
19403	4016	I personally think as a person who attends the library often, that things being taken away cause uproar in different ways	8
19404	4016	I have read multiple books that have been aquired from all different sections of the library	9
19405	4016	Some even pertainig to racism of my own ethinticity that uses words that are not to my liking	10
19406	4016	I tolerate with the words do to the fact that I would like to know what my ancestory had to do in order for me to get where I am today	11
19407	4016	Magazines are also a small portion of this conflict	12
19408	4016	As like movies though they are there to provide entertainment	13
19409	4016	Most people like to use the library for a time of relaxtion	14
19410	4016	The library is not just there for people to take books and other things it also there so that people can have a comfortable place to learn something	15
19411	4016	In conclusion, As a fellow person of the community and a frequent library attende, I think that things should not be taking off of shelves	16
19412	4016	Libraries provides various things that are not at a family disccreation level but, @MONTH1 provide help to other people	17
19413	4016	Some books pertain to racism of ethnitcity	18
19414	4016	It's not meant to be harmful but to show what your ancestor had to endure to get your where you are	19
19415	4016	Things like magazines are there for your entertainment and if you think it's inappropriate then you should'nt read or watch it.	20
19416	4018	Conflicting works of art such as books, music, and movies, have always been seen in libraries	0
19417	4018	Whether it's @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1, someone is going to be offended	1
19418	4018	But whether or not these offending works should be banned is a common topic among authors, musicians, and movie-goers alike	2
19419	4018	I personally believe that all of these works have a right to be seen, heard, or read, because the creator has put much effort into stating their opinion and have a right to freedom of the press	3
19420	4018	You could take any famous work and someone could be offended @CAPS5 it because it displays something contrary to their beliefs	4
19421	4018	But this does not mean that that work should be banned	5
19422	4018	Banning a book would mean total rejection to the author's thoughts and opinions, and everyone has a right to those	6
19423	4018	The censorship of any work is unconstitutional because as citizens of the @LOCATION1 we have total freedom of the press	7
19424	4018	You simply can't apply censorship because whether you keep it on the shelves or not, people are going to be offended	8
19425	4018	Also, as shown in @PERSON1's @CAPS4 @NUM2, the censorship of books could lead to a society unable to have a real knowledge of the past and the feelings and thoughts of the people of that age	9
19426	4018	To me, 'offensive' books, movies, and music are not bad, they are merely a stimulant for debate	10
19427	4018	They can allow you, rather than just the author, to express your feelings on what was presented in the works	11
19428	4018	But to completely remove the cometition of the debate would be sabotage	12
19429	4018	@PERSON2 @LOCATION1 that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.' @CAPS5 saying this she is expressing that if we all could go into a library and remove the books, magazines, movies, or music that we do not like, then there would be absolutely nothing left	13
19430	4018	Every work would be remove because at least one person is offended @CAPS5 every work of the sort	14
19431	4018	Therefore, to allow books to be read, music listened to, and movies watched is to allow everyone the freedom of writing down their thoughts or stances	15
19432	4018	The censorship of any work, anywhere, is allowing for the 'shutting up' of ideas	16
19433	4018	These ideas are the ones that keep society going @CAPS5 making us think and helping to formulate our opinions	17
19434	4018	@CAPS5 allowing this we are creating future generations of great thinkers	18
19435	4018	In this case, @CAPS5 keeping books, magazines, and music on the shelves, we can continue to 'learn from the past' and utilize the information and ideas that have been used throughout history	19
19436	4019	The shelf is an object that holds many types of diffierent materials such as movies, books, magazines, and music	0
19437	4019	Its all media and entertainment	1
19438	4019	But not everyone likes the media because one or all of these materials @MONTH1 be offensive towards the foriegn and children	2
19439	4019	Censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such	3
19440	4019	Yes we all the it in movies and music, but we do not want it in our libraries	4
19441	4019	A library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes	5
19442	4019	There are not for entertainment and things of that nature	6
19443	4019	Sometimes they could be a little fun but for the most part, people would like to take there children and show them something to help there minds focus on school	7
19444	4019	By all @CAPS1 rated @CAPS2 movies, dirty music, adult books and magzines should be taken off the shelves	8
19445	4019	One day as I was in the state library looking on the shelves for a book on @LOCATION1 and its people	9
19446	4019	As I was reading the book, it said some very mean and offensive things about the @CAPS3 people	10
19447	4019	I thought to myself that this book should be takken of the shelves forever and never seen again	11
19448	4019	It shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it	12
19449	4019	After some people read about the @CAPS3 people	13
19450	4019	They had second thoughts and started get angey and disliking them for theses things and offensive comments made	14
19451	4019	Magazines and movies should be taken of the shelves in the catagories in my opinion of the poeple in different countries and the way they live	15
19452	4019	That could be very sad for someone because they could of really went through everything in that movie or what ever that magzines says	16
19453	4019	Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles to these materials	17
19454	4019	If a child looks at an adult film and it happens to be for a child, wouldnt you think thats a little offensive	18
19455	4019	I know I would	19
19456	4019	There is no way I want my child watching some violet movie	20
19457	4019	We have to think for our children and the people that come in form different countries when it comes to public libraries	21
19458	4019	If censorship is not observed carfully then we could make the foriegners very angry or make our children become very violet and reckless because of the films on the shelves, and the people that come in to our country would never come back if they picked up the book that they might of thought that was int interesting but turns out to be very offensive in there opinion	22
19459	4019	Censorship is very imprtant in libraries and on the shelves	23
19460	4020	I can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the book shelf	0
19461	4020	I hope our children or any other children take this book off the shelf because it would be offensive or demeaning to the race of me or the children	1
19462	4020	This book would probably make the children asks question that we don't really want to talk about	2
19463	4020	This book would probably be a book I wouldn't recommend for my children to read or even look at the pages or cover of the book	3
19464	4020	I mean if it wasn' t demeaning to anybody's race or skin color I would let my children read it, but if it had like profanity and racial slurs in it I would tell my kids that this book is off limits until you are older	4
19465	4020	Certain magazines such as like swimsuit models and other inappropriate stuff my children shouldn't be aloud to look at	5
19466	4020	Music is like the magazines if it has like profanity and talks about drugs then I'm not going to let my kids listen to it	6
19467	4020	Movies are just like magazines and music, if it has inappropriate stuff in it then my kids don't need to watch or listen to it	7
19468	4020	My exception for a movie is if it is rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, then they are aloud to watch it but if it is rated @NUM1 or @CAPS3 then my kids can forget about watching it	8
19469	4020	So in the end, yes I can think of a book, movie, or magazine that I don't want my children or any children to get their hands on cause you never know what that could lead to	9
19470	4020	And if your a strict parent like I plan on being don't let your kids watch, look at, or listen to inappropriate stuff because that is just putting bad stuff in their brain	10
19471	4020	I have to admit I have watched, listened to, and looked at some bad stuff but I regret it all so very much so	11
19472	4020	There are so many inappropriate books, movies, magazines out there in today's libraries, it's bad because little kids can get a hold of this stuff and take it home without their parents noticing that they took this bad stuff home	12
19473	4021	If someone is offended by a book or a movie from a library, should they be able to get it removed	0
19474	4021	In the following I want to explain my opinion towards censorship in libraries	1
19475	4021	If some parents see a book they are offended by, and they don't think their children should be able to get it from the library, they could just forbid them to read it	2
19476	4021	I don't think they should be able to remove it, even though they might think other children shouldn't be able to get it either, but that's not their decision	3
19477	4021	Every parent has to decide on their own, if they want their children to get certain books, but one parent shouldn't be able to decide for everyone else by removing a book	4
19478	4021	Some people might be offended by certain books in libraries, but just because one person is offended by a book, doesn't mean that everyone else is going to be offended by it	5
19479	4021	Does this one person have the right to say that a book should be removed	6
19480	4021	It is their personal opinion that they don't like it, but by removing it they would also keep other people from reading it, and that is not fair	7
19481	4021	Different people like different books, and are offended by different books, so if everyone would remove a book they don't like from the library, there wouldn't be any books left	8
19482	4021	I think if someone is offended by a book, they just shouldn't read it	9
19483	4021	They could tell their friends and family not to read it, because they thought it was offensive, but in the end everyone should decide for themselves	10
19484	4021	I don't think people should be able to remove books from the libraries, but if the library itself thinks a book is offensive, then they shouldn't have it	11
19485	4021	It is their library, so it's their decision what books they want to have there	12
19486	4021	i also think that when the library doesn't have certain books, because they really pay attention to the books they take in their library, that that should be good enough for other people	13
19487	4021	So all in all I don't think people should be able able to remove certain books, because everyone has their own opinion towards what is offensive, and what isn't	14
19488	4021	We all should be able to read or see, what we want to, and not what others think we should.	15
19489	4022	Everywhere I go, there always seems to be something, small or big, that can be considered offensive	0
19490	4022	Because of these offensive things, there is often censorship in public places	1
19491	4022	It is acceptable to view non-noncensored materials at your own disgression and privacy, but not very acceptable to do so in public	2
19492	4022	I believe that censorship is necessary in libraries because of the wide range of audiences, the public materials, and the opinions of certain people	3
19493	4022	Libraries are considered public places and have a wide range of audiences	4
19494	4022	Whether it be children, teens, adults, or elders, some things are inappropriate and should not be accessible to certain people	5
19495	4022	This is directed mainly to children, however	6
19496	4022	Like the quote mentioned, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 put these offensive books in libraries then	7
19497	4022	Censorship will block out inappropriate parts of books, movies, music, and magazines in order to make these materials more suitable for all age groups	8
19498	4022	Because libraries are considered public places, their materials are considered public property	9
19499	4022	Everyone has the right to these materials	10
19500	4022	However, not every library will have the book, magazine, or movie you could be searching for due to the fact that it @MONTH1 contain profanity, or inappropriate content	11
19501	4022	Some people @MONTH1 be against censorship in libraries, but there often is not censorship in bookstores, movie stores, music libraries, etc	12
19502	4022	If you desire a certain non-censored material, then go purchase it	13
19503	4022	That way the material will no longer be public, but rather your own and you can do with it whatever you choose	14
19504	4022	We now live in a world where everyone voices their opinion freely and you can not be punished for doing so	15
19505	4022	Libraries are targeted toward every age group and censorship just allows everything to be appropriate for everyone	16
19506	4022	Certain parents do not allow their children to read certain books, view certain movies, or listen to certain music and this is just because it is their opinion and their parenting	17
19507	4022	Some parents, on the other hand, do allow their children to partake in inappropriate materials, and that is perfectly fine, because it is their parenting and their children	18
19508	4022	However, libraries should not have the right to introduce inappropriate things into the lives of children	19
19509	4022	that should be the decision of the parents or gaurdians	20
19510	4022	In conclusion, censorship should be allowed in libraries because of the wide-range audience, public materials, and the strong opinions of the people	21
19511	4022	Everyone deserves to read, watch, and listen to whatever they choose, but not everyone deserves to be around inappropriate things in public places	22
19512	4022	Not everyone can be happy, but everyone can be appropriate	23
19513	4023	In my experience some music is just too offensive	0
19514	4023	They use words that should not be heard by certain people and especially certain ages	1
19515	4023	Even the magazines have things that are just way too inappropriate for some people	2
19516	4023	Some of the movies they put out these days are just horrifying to see	3
19517	4023	The fact that they put these things in a library shocks me greatly	4
19518	4023	One day I was babysitting a little girl and I had taken her to the library	5
19519	4023	There was a @CAPS1 on a shelf and she put it in her @CAPS1 player	6
19520	4023	It  was making very sexual references and had many curse words in it	7
19521	4023	I was mortified that the little girl had to hear those words at such a young age	8
19522	4023	As soon as I put my ear to her head phones, I turned it off immediately	9
19523	4023	They should really watch @CAPS4 music they put put out to the public because if I hadn't of been with her, she might have picked up on some of those words	10
19524	4023	I don't think @CAPS3 would want anyone listening to that kind of language at any age really	11
19525	4023	It disciminates woman and gives young children ideas in their heads of sexual activities	12
19526	4023	One other thing they put out in libraries i don't agree with is magazines that are a little too mature	13
19527	4023	I went to the library one day with a friend of mine and i picked up a @ORGANIZATION1 magazine	14
19528	4023	I was flipping around and I saw all these revealing pictures and I was thinking to myself, '@CAPS4 if a yooung cjild picked up this magazine when no one was looking?' That would be a horrible experience for a young child to have	15
19529	4023	I've read somewhere that things children see at a young age, have a great effect on who they will become	16
19530	4023	If this is true I certainly thing we should censor @CAPS4 we out out in our public libraries and be careful if we take our children to the library	17
19531	4023	We should make sure the next generation doesn't see certain things that we have	18
19532	4023	We should also monitor the movies the watch and keep a close eye on the things they read	19
19533	4025	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf	0
19534	4025	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
19535	4025	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from @PERSON1 voices a strong point on citizenship	2
19536	4025	Censorship happens everywhere you are	3
19537	4025	Whether its a book, a magazine article, or even a tv show things are censored	4
19538	4025	Censoring things doesn'@CAPS7 make anything more enjoyable, but infact makes less things enjoyable	5
19539	4025	I think that things that are offensive should niot be removed from the shelf	6
19540	4025	Censorship diasble the viewer and or reader to be able to enjoy the full potential of things	7
19541	4025	I myself watch tv shows all of the time	8
19542	4025	When the censor things it makes me angry	9
19543	4025	I already know what the words are so why censor it	10
19544	4025	@PERSON2 wrote a famous book called @ORGANIZATION1	11
19545	4025	and that books has been banned from being taught in schools simply because it says a racial term	12
19546	4025	I have two things to say about it	13
19547	4025	One if it offends you then you shouldn'@CAPS7 watch or read it	14
19548	4025	Second one would have to consider the time and age that the book has taken place and that was language used back then	15
19549	4025	So then one could take in thoght when the book was written, what was the time of when the book had taken place, ect	16
19550	4025	There are two books that I read called the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @NUM1	17
19551	4025	Both books have one thing in common	18
19552	4025	The use of censorship in their society	19
19553	4025	In @CAPS3 @NUM1 books are censored	20
19554	4025	@CAPS1 causes one to challenge that concept because he and others felt that it wasn'@CAPS7 fair for books to be banned	21
19555	4025	Also in the @CAPS2 a boy challenges his @CAPS6 society because they too censored certain things	22
19556	4025	Censorship also happens in todays' media	23
19557	4025	Some example are @CAPS7.V shows	24
19558	4025	TV censors vulgar language, and sometimes violence and gore	25
19559	4025	Now its understandable to censor childrens shows but shows for mature audiences are unacceptable	26
19560	4025	Considering the freedom of speech one can express	27
19561	4025	Also mature shows are only ment for mature people to watch them so why censor them	28
19562	4025	Katherine Paterson makes a valid point in her quote	29
19563	4025	I feel that if you find something to be offensive then don'@CAPS7 read or watch it	30
19564	4025	If you feel that something is so offensive to you that you have to compell otheras in to believings what you think then you are wrong	31
19565	4025	People should have the right to read, watch, or listen to anything they want uncensored.	32
19566	4026	Does censorship solve any problems	0
19567	4026	If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away	1
19568	4026	As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road	2
19569	4026	The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material	3
19570	4026	Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young	4
19571	4026	It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read	5
19572	4026	If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned	6
19573	4026	For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music	7
19574	4026	A great mental image of serenity and peace	8
19575	4026	How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves	9
19576	4026	Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad	10
19577	4026	Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers	11
19578	4026	With this system, everyone suffers	12
19579	4026	Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to	13
19580	4026	It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries	14
19581	4026	History has given the world many a cruel dictator	15
19582	4026	Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms	16
19583	4026	To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights	17
19584	4026	This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship	18
19585	4026	If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes	19
19586	4026	With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused	20
19587	4026	Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights	21
19588	4026	People would not stand for it	22
19589	4026	So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom	23
19590	4026	There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing	24
19591	4026	Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights	25
19592	4026	There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence	26
19593	4026	Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble	27
19594	4026	That can disappear in a instant	28
19595	4026	Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age	29
19596	4026	Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it	30
19597	4026	The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point	31
19598	4026	A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young	32
19599	4026	Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children	33
19600	4026	It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon	34
19601	4026	The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people	35
19602	4026	Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship	36
19603	4026	Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy	37
19604	4026	Therefore, why censor	38
19605	4027	I think certain books such as offensive books shouldn't be remove	0
19606	4027	I dont think so because that's how some kids learn better and read better	1
19607	4027	Kid's dont like reading boring books	2
19608	4027	Things like music, movies, and magazines are interesting to us	3
19609	4027	If this world didn't have movies kids wouldn't read books	4
19610	4027	Most of these kids now a days read books because they watch the movie to the story	5
19611	4027	Some kids like listening to music while reading	6
19612	4027	I'm glade people invited these thing's	7
19613	4027	I feel like if people didn't invited these things this world would be boring	8
19614	4027	Magazines are also great because they help people start to read books and so on	9
19615	4027	Magazines are entataining to people	10
19616	4027	I say they are because they have pictures, glossip, and much more	11
19617	4027	Magazines are good to read it help alot of people to read better	12
19618	4027	It's also bad because kids read it and start doing what they say in the magazine	13
19619	4027	Some books are good some are bad	14
19620	4027	I say that because some books get out of control with cursin and the cover of the books well pictures	15
19621	4027	Some arthurs write good things and some write bad things	16
19622	4027	Hope you get something out of what i wrote	17
19623	4027	This is how i feel about books, magazines, music, and movies	18
19624	4027	I love to read and listen to all of them	19
19625	4027	I enjoy books alot	20
19626	4027	P.S  @ORGANIZATION1	21
19627	4028	When @LOCATION2 was made and our fore fathers signed the constituition of the @LOCATION1, freedom was the big kahuna	0
19628	4028	With every signature endorsment added to the constituion, @LOCATION2 became one of the few countries with freedom in every right	1
19629	4028	Laws such as 'you are innocent until proven guilty' and freedom of speech have made our country stand out from other nations that suppress thier own people.Freedom is @LOCATION2's middle name and it is the birth right to our future	2
19630	4028	Freedom of speech has been shown everywhere and even though some people's voices say a little too much it is still a right given to us so we must accept the nonsense that is said	3
19631	4028	Offensive things are common, since we are all differnt and the variety of ethnic groups in @LOCATION2 are so vast, that at one point in time someones toe are going to get seriously stepped on	4
19632	4028	This is not tolerated but still it goes on through the world	5
19633	4028	Freedom of speech is a unidentified form of express, since it is allowed to say what you feel but sometimes it is said to much and you end up in a fight	6
19634	4028	Speech is still a freedom though, and if we cut out freedom we would be in a bad spot	7
19635	4028	Genocide, and inlawful inprisonment are two factors that happen regulary on account of no freedom	8
19636	4028	If you speak out against a powerful figure, you go to jail	9
19637	4028	If you belief in something differnt armys come and kill you, all because some country do not have freedom like @LOCATION2	10
19638	4028	This freedom might cause controversy and produce offensive products such as reading material and videos but its alot better than living under the shadow of a dictator	11
19639	4028	Crude forms of freedom always end up on magazines, books, and cd's but if you think about it there being produced then they are being bought, or they would not be made at all	12
19640	4028	On certain occasions items are not being made for economical benefit but mearly on belief and religous values, that is also a freedom that many have paid with there life, to have	13
19641	4028	Also with the production of books, movies, and cd's you are protected from being exposed to points of view you do not like these things do have a rated supervision system, and if you do not like the product put it down and walk away, yes it is that easy	14
19642	4028	I do not see freedom being thrown out the window anytime soon, we might just have to keep living with offensive products	15
19643	4028	We should all just be glad we live in afree society that lets us express our diffrence without being killed in the process	16
19644	4028	You cant just go take the constitution and disgard like trash so society will just have to bear the burden of expressed freedom	17
19645	4028	Freedom comes in disc and books but it is still @LOCATION2's middle name and the birth right to our future	18
19646	4029	Do you think that books, movies, music, etc., should be moved if they are found offensive	0
19647	4029	I can't choose @CAPS3 they are both understandable	1
19648	4029	Therefore, I well dicuss how i feel about it in this essay and what I have experience on this topic	2
19649	4029	Well lets get started	3
19650	4029	I could go both ways with this	4
19651	4029	But first I well just discuss the way I disagree with removing offensive things	5
19652	4029	Material that is instersting to many people mght not be instersting to me	6
19653	4029	I mean everyone should be able to listen and read things that the loved and enjoy	7
19654	4029	And I could really careless what other people loved to read and listen to	8
19655	4029	Someday, we all might come to enjoy things that we wouldn't every think we would	9
19656	4029	It's just that simply	10
19657	4029	I mean I love romance and scary books, and someone else might dislike them both	11
19658	4029	Noone can tell anyone what they should like or dislike	12
19659	4029	I agree in away too	13
19660	4029	When people make a big deal out of somethings it kind of gets on your nerves, like when your mom is telling you make sure room is clean all the time	14
19661	4029	I agree with this @CAPS3 something maybe to offensive to someone and doesn't want their children	15
19662	4029	One time I was in a library looking at this book that really seemed good to read	16
19663	4029	But then some lady told me that I shouldn't read it @CAPS3 it to much for me	17
19664	4029	But it was just right for me	18
19665	4029	@CAPS2 went up to the main desk and started complaining	19
19666	4029	I was like, 'Are you serious?' I didn't want to be rude so I told her calmly, '@CAPS1 are you so worried about what I am reading?' @CAPS2 replied, ' @CAPS3, the book is to reviling.' I showed her what the book was called, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6'	20
19667	4029	We ended the agruement	21
19668	4029	I still checked out the book, @CAPS3 I knew I would love it, and I do	22
19669	4029	They should just put things aside, that they think well be offensive and let people ask for the things	23
19670	4029	So people won't make a big deal out of it	24
19671	4029	Just keep the peace and give everyone what they want	25
19672	4029	Well I'm done now	26
19673	4029	Hope you understand both sides of the agruement	27
19674	4029	Just remember that if you agree or disagree.Or you like me, who can't choice or understands both sides	28
19675	4029	It's your decision and noone can make you change what you love and enjoy to read or listen to	29
19676	4029	But I can't pick aside @CAPS3 either way their both a understandable.	30
19677	4030	I believe that certain materials that seem offensive to certain people should stay on the shelves	0
19678	4030	I feel like as though its on that person whether they choose to read or listen to the material or not	1
19679	4030	I have also been in this position where I came cross an article that upset me	2
19680	4030	Also I have had an arguement once with someone who found what I was listening to was offensive to them	3
19681	4030	Once when I was reading a paper on that was making fun of my town that I grew up in	4
19682	4030	The paper said how my town was filled with rednecks and that many people there were not very educated and not intelligent	5
19683	4030	This upest me and made me feel ashamed for living there	6
19684	4030	But I thought more and more that this article was someone elses opinion	7
19685	4030	That just because they wrote that article, doesn't make it true	8
19686	4030	This arguement went out of hand	9
19687	4030	She had her opinion and I also had mine	10
19688	4030	My friend came by my house one day to hang out and do some homework	11
19689	4030	While we were in my room I turned on my favorite artists cd	12
19690	4030	I listened to rock music at the time and loved how talented the artist was	13
19691	4030	My friend went to my sterio and turned it off	14
19692	4030	She told me she didnt like it and that it was offensive music	15
19693	4030	So after that we pretty much argued the whole time	16
19694	4030	I finally said that I feel its great music and I shouldnt have to stop listening to it	17
19695	4030	We had a deal that while she was there I wouldnt listen to it, I felt I would respect her feelings	18
19696	4030	Over the past years I have observed that more people are taking what others have to say or sing about to heart	19
19697	4030	When an author writes a story or an article, they are putting their opinion into it	20
19698	4030	Sometimes they are typing the facts and also what they feel is write to say	21
19699	4030	I mean if it is on the shelf and dislike it, dont pick it up and read it.	22
19700	4032	I think people read more books that are banned from schools and libraries, they listen to 'rebel' music, or they just watch controvesial movies, so is censoring really effective	0
19701	4032	I do not think censoring  is really necessary	1
19702	4032	If you think a subject might be offensive for you, you should not read it	2
19703	4032	instead of censoring the products in a library we should censor the readers, I believe people are mature enough to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen	3
19704	4032	Media is just another way to gain knowledge that's why they are used at school	4
19705	4032	I would like to go to my school library and find books like, 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2', I know this book is considered as one of @LOCATION1's most famous literature work, but it was once banned from some schools around the nation	5
19706	4032	The reason of the banning was that they believed that the book contained pornography, and it wasn't school appropiate	6
19707	4032	My english teacher used this method, by telling us this, to encourage us to read it	7
19708	4032	My classmates who hadn't read the book wanted to find the pornography in it, if you were to ask me..	8
19709	4032	I did not find it	9
19710	4032	Another literary work which was banned once is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', this book was banned because @PERSON1, a black character in the book, was called a @CAPS4,and thought to be stupid sometimes during the book	10
19711	4032	Even though @PERSON1 is the most noble and innocent character in the book, some people found this offensive and not appropiate	11
19712	4032	Movies with strong language are rated for it's public so I don't think this should be a problem	12
19713	4032	Music in the other hand, depends on the singer's music style and that should be monitored by parents	13
19714	4032	I trully believe that we should not censor any material in libraries, but if it's necessary, they could stablish an age limit to check-out any controversial material	14
19715	4032	As I said before, media is just another way to gain knowledge	15
19716	4033	As @CAPS1, we are entitled to both freedom of speech and freedom of the press	0
19717	4033	However, these rights are somewhat suppressed in the censorship of media at libraries	1
19718	4033	I can understand why libraries feel that they need to ban certain works	2
19719	4033	there are many children that frequent libraries, and having explicit content could deter parents from allowing them to visit	3
19720	4033	Surely, though, the media in question could be placed in a seperate area, off-limits to anyone under a certain age	4
19721	4033	Even if someone gets their hands on one of these works, safeguards could be used at the front desk to keep them from borrowing the material	5
19722	4033	Their library card would show their age, and the worker would not allow them to check out the work if they were too young	6
19723	4033	Furthermore, I trust in people's common sense	7
19724	4033	If they believe that a book or movie will be too adult for them, they will avoid checking it out of the library	8
19725	4033	Parents, as well, will surely not allow their children to borrow risque material	9
19726	4033	Information is open to those that search for it, and the knowledge it brings prevents unwanted results	10
19727	4033	There are those that want this content banned because it does not conform to their morals, but this is really just setting restrictions on other's freedoms	11
19728	4033	They @MONTH1 think it is too explicit, but another @MONTH1 not	12
19729	4033	That other person might want to use the material, but because of restrictions set by the first person, the borrowing of the work becomes prohibited	13
19730	4033	It seems that if the first doesn't agree with the material, they could just let it be, and not bring others into the dispute	14
19731	4033	People know their limits and generally make sure they don't cross them	15
19732	4033	I think this conflict represents the @CAPS2 way of life in itself	16
19733	4033	When a disagreement arises, no matter what the topic, one group of people wants to basically control what everyone else can or cannot do	17
19734	4033	They organize protests, sign petitions, etc	18
19735	4033	True, people do protest laws, and with good reason	19
19736	4033	However, there really is no need to argue over petty issues that could easily be avoided if people were to just use common sense to reach a consensus	20
19737	4033	I think this censorship issue is a prime example of that	21
19738	4033	When it comes to these kinds of debates, we need to learn that we can't be too quick to place restrictions	22
19739	4033	that we should leave others to do what they think is best for themselves	23
19740	4033	The best course of action is to leave others alone concerning simple things such as this, and to avoid placing any restrictions on anyone's works, rights, and freedom	24
19741	4033	To paraphrase @ORGANIZATION1, I @MONTH1 not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death your right to say it.	25
19742	4034	I believe certain materails such like books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and are inappropiate	0
19743	4034	Why I believe @CAPS1 is because there are things that are in these items that hurt people in many ways	1
19744	4034	But when the people make and read these items they dont know how effective it is to the people that are buying these items from the maker	2
19745	4034	I also had experience a offensive book and a inappropiate book	3
19746	4034	When I went to a public libary I picked up @CAPS1 book and said too my self ' @CAPS1 might be a good book I can do for my book report' so as I picked up the book and flip threw the pages I saw words and images that offened me.there was words that where calling color people out by there names and pictures of the color women getting rape or abuse	4
19747	4034	So I did not get that book I just put it back and was mad at the people that treated my culture wrong	5
19748	4034	So @CAPS1 white lady 'The libraryan' came up to me and asked me did I need help finding anything, but I did not answer her I just looked at her and shook my head	6
19749	4034	As I walked threw the library I saw inappropiate books such as '@CAPS2 books' that these kids was looking at I could not believe what I was seeing	7
19750	4034	Becasue I think they should have these books some where else so that the younger kids will not get to these adult books including the music that always talk about @CAPS2, drugs, and gangs	8
19751	4034	Because I think these things are bad for the younger kids to be looking at or listing to because it can effect there futrure in life and also can cause violence, abuse, harrasment stuff that will get our younger childern in trouble as they get older	9
19752	4034	I think all public libraries should have @CAPS1 type of stuff kept in a section for adults only and have to show some type of I.d to prove you are @NUM1 and older.	10
19753	4035	Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1,     Censorship in libraries should never be an issue	0
19754	4035	It is a very simple concept	1
19755	4035	Obviously, no one wants their children being exposed to inappropriate reading material or movies	2
19756	4035	If a child wishes to visit the public library, their parents shouldn't have to worry about what their children will be looking at there	3
19757	4035	A library should be a family-friendly place where children can get together for story time, or where college students can study	4
19758	4035	I remember going to the library all the time when I was younger	5
19759	4035	I would read a different story every week with a large group of kids in the community	6
19760	4035	It was something I enjoyed doing	7
19761	4035	Don't you want your community library to be a place where children can learn and enjoy themselves	8
19762	4035	Unfortunately, some libraries do have offensive reading material, movies, music, etc	9
19763	4035	It is the responsibility of the library employees to put these offensive materials in the adult reading section of the building	10
19764	4035	Parents should tell their children that the adult section is off-limits, and the library employees should keep children from every being in that restricted area	11
19765	4035	These items @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, and they @MONTH1 be too inappropriate for children	12
19766	4035	However, there are some readers who have the right to look at these materials if they want	13
19767	4035	That's why they shouldn't be taken off of the shelves completely, just removed from the rest of the books, music, movies, etc	14
19768	4035	I am not one to deny anyone their rights	15
19769	4035	Even though I don't personally see the need for offensive reading materials in a public library, that doesn't mean that someone else shouldn't get to view these items	16
19770	4035	All in all, we have to be fair	17
19771	4035	Would you want someone taking away your right to do something you like to do because they find it offensive	18
19772	4035	No, nobody wants that	19
19773	4035	However, we still have to be reasonable about it	20
19774	4035	If there are going to be adult reading materials in a community library, they have to be in an area where children aren't allowed	21
19775	4035	It's just common courtesy, and everyone has to cooperate	22
19776	4035	This is why censorship in libraries should never be an issue	23
19777	4035	I hope that you can see it my way, and help me in fixing this issue once and for all	24
19778	4035	Sincerely,                                                  @LOCATION1	25
19779	4036	We all have that favorite book, mine is ' OF @CAPS1 and @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 is a book I would recomend to anybody, but there are libraries that have some books that are so bad I would be scared if my mom even picked it up and looked at the cover	0
19780	4036	My name is @PERSON1, and during @CAPS3 essay I am going to show you what I am talking about	1
19781	4036	I love to read during the day	2
19782	4036	I like to go out and just pick a book right off the shelf and start then and there reading, but when I see a book or a magazine that holds sexual acts in them I become very anger	3
19783	4036	I have seen many of my friends get lost in these books and magazines right in front of a adult like there mothers	4
19784	4036	They can go to a public library where they're children (as young as the age of five) and read and look at these terriable things	5
19785	4036	I don'@CAPS4 know why these books are even needed in a library	6
19786	4036	Now people can get on the @CAPS4.V's and but or rent them	7
19787	4036	I have a best friend who lost is father to these sexual acts and pictures	8
19788	4036	My friends mother had enough and had to kick him out	9
19789	4036	Now my friend is becoming the same person	10
19790	4036	He can go out and buy these magazines from friends that steals or rents them from our local library	11
19791	4036	He doesn'@CAPS4 even reconizes that his father did the same thing	12
19792	4036	He still never wants to see is father, but what he is doing is the same thing that his father also did	13
19793	4036	I have had varies talks with @CAPS3 friend, but he said it isn'@CAPS4 hurting anybody, but what he doesn'@CAPS4 see is that he is hurting me	14
19794	4036	Back in the late @NUM1's early @NUM2's parents saw some of the books that their children were reading	15
19795	4036	That tried to put a stop to it, but the plan never worked	16
19796	4036	Since then @CAPS3 problem has grown to a point that we will never be able to control	17
19797	4036	The libraries do @CAPS3 all for money they make	18
19798	4036	More people go to a library now not to study or to read in peace, but to get a sex high	19
19799	4036	@CAPS3 is where about  half of the libraries money is being made	20
19800	4036	The goverment tries to stay out of @CAPS3, because the money they get through taxes is coming of these people	21
19801	4036	When will it stop	22
19802	4036	No one really knows, but we will try to stop it all we can	23
19803	4036	The reason for @CAPS3 essay was to show why the process needs to be stop	24
19804	4036	If you go to your local library and really look at what they sell or rent out, you will then know what I am saying	25
19805	4036	I will try to stop it, but probably will not suceed	26
19806	4036	That will not stop me with helping my friends in the future	27
19807	4036	Just be glad that you know about it now	28
19808	4037	Offensive much	0
19809	4037	Thats what multiple people feel towards curtain books	1
19810	4037	For instence if @CAPS5 was the bible and you were an athiest, or a person who doesn't believe in god, then the bible @MONTH1 be offensive and hurtfull to you	2
19811	4037	I feel as a student that there are so many people in the world that by the time everyone inserts their own feelings by taking away books then we would have nothing left to read	3
19812	4037	You see, everyone is different in their own way, so books, magazines and music wouldn't be around because everyone feels differently about different subjects	4
19813	4037	I feel that they are a resourse that is very helpfull, and multiple times knowledgeable on many grasping subjects	5
19814	4037	First, besides books, we have magazines	6
19815	4037	If we would get rid of all of the magazines in the world then there would be a cut down on all those horrible advertisements that men long for	7
19816	4037	Second there would be less gossip	8
19817	4037	Most magazines are about @PERCENT1 gossip about the recent break-ups, and make-ups, of todays modern celebritys	9
19818	4037	I feel that the magazines are a waste of time because they hurt peoples feelings, also its offensive the way that some famous people act	10
19819	4037	I strongly believe we should take magazines off the shelves	11
19820	4037	Lastly there is music	12
19821	4037	Some of the greatest inspiration comes from music	13
19822	4037	Don't you remember the song, 'We @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3?' @CAPS4 if you don't then i'll tell you a little about @CAPS5	14
19823	4037	@CAPS5's about america, things that have happened in the past and were a big deal	15
19824	4037	In the chorus @CAPS5 says, '-we @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3,- but we tried to fight @CAPS5	16
19825	4037	@CAPS5's always been burning since the worlds been turning.' @CAPS5's a song that is about americans saying that they @CAPS1't cause panic and such things, but that since the begining of time @CAPS5 already was	17
19826	4037	The song inspired many of the famous singers you @CAPS4 know	18
19827	4037	Elvis @CAPS6 is one of the many that you should know	19
19828	4037	We should keep music out so people, like me, who have been inspired, can inspire others	20
19829	4037	Music helps the blind, heals those who are sick, and give hope to americans	21
19830	4037	Without mucis there would be chaos	22
19831	4037	Last and furthermore is movies, where would we be without movies	23
19832	4037	We need movies, not just for our intertainment, but some of the best movies are historical events	24
19833	4037	Events that help us get a better grasp and keen look at what has happened in the past	25
19834	4037	For instince the movie @CAPS7, and @LOCATION1, even the movie The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, they all help us picture events that have happened and are very enjoyable but also very educational	26
19835	4037	We should keep movies, there is no doubt in my mind	27
19836	4037	In conclusion I hope I have created a clear message that you will take into consideration highly	28
19837	4037	We need books and music to inspire and electrify the world, and magazines we need not	29
19838	4037	We all need a little inspiration in our down spiraling lives, and we need education	30
19839	4037	Not the kind that we wish to see but the kind we need to see	31
19840	4037	I hope I have made a positive inpact on your thoughts, and feelings.	32
19841	4038	There are too many people in the world to just have one opinion about one topic and nothing else	0
19842	4038	If a person knows something is unjust, they obviously have to tell the world about it, or they feel like their opinion does not matter	1
19843	4038	Take, for example, women's clothing	2
19844	4038	If you show a man a piece of women's clothing on a computer screen, he will probably only have one or two opinions about that piece of clothing	3
19845	4038	If you show a woman that same piece of clothing, she will have more than two opinions about the piece of clothing	4
19846	4038	This is how society works today and it is not just because we were brought up that way	5
19847	4038	this is how we think and how we act	6
19848	4038	@ORGANIZATION1 depicts beautiful as half dressed and makup put on like plaster	7
19849	4038	Many magazines and books, such as @CAPS1 and books about modeling, portray beautiful as stick thin and your clothes almost falling off your body	8
19850	4038	Many songs and movies tell you that being beautiful is on the outside	9
19851	4038	If you can find these magazines, books, and movies at your local bookstore, don't you think that they could possibly be two miles down the road at your local @CAPS2 library	10
19852	4038	Libraries aren't just for adults and teenagers	11
19853	4038	They are intended for people of all ages	12
19854	4038	Many people do not realize this, but at many libraries, there are sections specified for teenagers	13
19855	4038	Young adult books and magazines should not even be put in the teenager section, only for the reason that there are subjects in many of the young adult books that a lot of teenagers have not even begun to dicuss yet	14
19856	4038	If these books and magazines are put in here for teenagers, do you not think a five year old child could wander up to the section, take out a magazine and wonder how the women in the advertisements grew up to be so beautiful	15
19857	4038	Like I said before, @ORGANIZATION1 depicts people to look beautiful, when it's all photo-shopped	16
19858	4038	If a five year old child can get their hands on books and magazines that they shouldn't even know about, @CAPS3 would a library keep them on their shelves	17
19859	4038	The thoughts that the five year old child has now is '@CAPS3 am I not that beautiful?' @CAPS4 image is the key to how people view society today	18
19860	4038	Modeling agencies, photographers, and even cheerleading coaches make girls feel like they are worthless because they are 'too fat', 'too ugly', or 'too short' to be part of what they have wanted to be in their entire lives	19
19861	4038	Many women that @CAPS8 starve themselves every day just to maintain the 'healthy weight' which is @NUM1 pounds and you can see every rib in her body	20
19862	4038	Many books, magazines, and television shows portray this as well	21
19863	4038	You can find them in libraries nation-wide	22
19864	4038	The magazine, @CAPS1, has articles about how to become skinny	23
19865	4038	The television show, @LOCATION1's @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8, shows people that being tall and as skinny as a stick is the way to go	24
19866	4038	Many workout books tell you that being like @PERSON1 is the 'best for your bod' way to be	25
19867	4038	You cannot tell a girl that she needs to be a specific height and a specific weight by a specific time	26
19868	4038	Woman don't work that way	27
19869	4038	No one does	28
19870	4038	Many magazines, books, movies, and music tell you this, and it is not true	29
19871	4038	I believe that if libraries took these types of materials out of their facilities, then if would drop the rate of society's '@CAPS4 image' rapidly	30
19872	4038	Many woman and girls wouldn't feel like they are ugly or fat	31
19873	4038	They would love who they were and they would not believe what another person says about them or what they look like	32
19874	4038	Being beautiful is not just on the outside	33
19875	4038	Anyone can have a beautiful heart and that will shine through more than anything else.	34
19876	4039	Ever went to the library and seen a book that was to graphic for a certain section	0
19877	4039	When little kids came into the library does it seem like they should stay away from that section	1
19878	4039	Well censorship should be in librarys now a days	2
19879	4039	Many children are seeing bad material at too young of an age	3
19880	4039	Due to seeing this they @MONTH1 get bad ideas and possibly lead them the wrong way in life	4
19881	4039	In librarys they have many books that are too mature for young children	5
19882	4039	They should have a restricted section in the librarys that only peolple of age or with parental guidance can pick books, movies, music, games, and magizenes from that section	6
19883	4039	For example, in video stores they have and adult section that only adults @MONTH1 enter not children	7
19884	4039	Librarys should be that same way but not with same material in video stores	8
19885	4039	Personaly, I have seen children learning bad behaviors from video games, movies, and some books	9
19886	4039	While these children are young they do not know what is bad for them	10
19887	4039	So when these kids see the movie stars they envy and video games they enjoy harming other people they will pick up on the violence and do it themselves	11
19888	4039	Librarys do need to take these books, movies, games, music, and magazines off of the shelves	12
19889	4039	If they do not then they should make a place children can not get ahold of these materals that can affect judgement	13
19890	4039	So when taking a younger child ta a library go in with and walk with them	14
19891	4039	It will save our kids of the next generation from violence and all other wrong doing habbits in these books, games, magazines, and music	15
19892	4039	As long as there is not censorship in librarys our children will see these bahaviors and recreate them with other friends thinking thats its okay to do	16
19893	4039	Yes, once again I say censorship should be in librarys of any thing of certain age groups or if it is offencive	17
19894	4039	Do not let young kids walk alone in librarys so they can come across the wrong material for their age.	18
19895	4040	Books have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years	0
19896	4040	They have significent value in culture, lives, and everything else	1
19897	4040	We all see kids laughing and enjoying books about pretty ponies and little puppies	2
19898	4040	What we don't see is how books and magazines are really effecting people of different race, religion, or age	3
19899	4040	We should take a stand and get rid of these bad books	4
19900	4040	Negitive books, movies, and magazines should be taken off the shelf to prevent hurt feelings and ideas	5
19901	4040	We have learned to accept everybody no matter what color they are	6
19902	4040	I remember in @NUM1 grade when a girl named @PERSON1 got very upset because she thought a book was making fun of her skin color	7
19903	4040	Everyone in the book was white and excluded a african american girl from playing with them because she wasn't pretty enough	8
19904	4040	She went to tell the teacher and the teacher threw the book away and said that we should all learn to treat everyone with respect no matter what they look like	9
19905	4040	We need to have more books like what the teacher was trying to teach us	10
19906	4040	To boost everyones spirits and make them feel better about themselves	11
19907	4040	The world has changed and books should too	12
19908	4040	Many things influence people of different ages, race, or religion	13
19909	4040	Books that talk bad about other religions or make you second guess your faith are considered negitive and should be taken off the shelf	14
19910	4040	How would you like it if someone was putting down your religion	15
19911	4040	That is how many people feel when reading that kind of material	16
19912	4040	These books, magazines, and movies are not good for anybody and should not be anywhere near libraries	17
19913	4040	Have you been watching what your kids are reading about or what movies they are watching	18
19914	4040	Most of childrens books and movies have pretty princesses and little mermaids but not all of them	19
19915	4040	Behind some movies or books there is are violence and bad scenes	20
19916	4040	When fight scenes occur and zombies attack, children believe that everything is real and that it is ok to kill someone if they are a bad	21
19917	4040	Boys believe that it is ok to hurt people because that is what happens in the movies	22
19918	4040	Girls believe that everything about a princess is perfect and flawless and to be a princess they also have to be flawless	23
19919	4040	Do we really want childrent to think it is ok to fight and be upset because they are not perfect	24
19920	4040	Libraries need to get rid of these book and movies because it is badly influencing the children in the world	25
19921	4040	Not all books are bad and not all of them are good, so we need to divide and conquer	26
19922	4040	We need to take a closer look and really examine what needs to be taken off the shelves	27
19923	4040	The books, magazines, and movies that influence people to think differently about themselves need to go away for good	28
19924	4040	To get rid of these books that cause conflict within a person is like getting rid of a big burden	29
19925	4040	It can make a really big improvment in adults and children	30
19926	4040	Please take negitive books and movies off the shelves to prevent any unnecessary problems!	31
19927	4041	Books @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3      @CAPS4 your in a library its many book that children decide to read that @MONTH1 not be suited for their @CAPS3	0
19928	4041	Many parents allow their kids to read those type of books so they're use to it now	1
19929	4041	But some book aren't for children @CAPS3	2
19930	4041	Now and days kids are more mature and knowledgeable and can read on higher levels	3
19931	4041	@CAPS4 kids go to the library they look for book that catch their attention	4
19932	4041	Some books that are out shouldn't be out and thats my opinion	5
19933	4041	Most authors write about things such as sex, drugs, and other bad thing	6
19934	4041	@CAPS4 a child looks at things like that they get ideas about what the book is talking about and try those things they read	7
19935	4041	Im not saying that all kids read books and decide to try all the things that they read, but most will	8
19936	4041	Some kids minmic off certain things they hear, see and even read	9
19937	4041	Kids are always going to look up to other people so what they see you do they will try to do it	10
19938	4041	I beleive that things like books that kids should'nt read should be put away	11
19939	4041	Books should be taken off the shelves and put in places where only adults could get them	12
19940	4041	Just like video games only a certain age group could play the game because of the things they do in the game	13
19941	4041	The things kids see they soon try out	14
19942	4041	They should also make it where you rate a book like you rate movies, video games and other things	15
19943	4041	All books aren't bad for children @CAPS3 but some are	16
19944	4041	I notice that many parents don't care about what their kids read as long as they're reading	17
19945	4041	People should'nt think that way  because its alot of crule people in this world	18
19946	4041	I even seen on the news where it was an author who wrote a book about how he killed a lady	19
19947	4041	So many teens read that book and found it interesting	20
19948	4041	And it even gave young boys ideas about killing people or girl friends	21
19949	4041	That book should be in the hands of someone with a mature mind that really knows right from wrong	22
19950	4041	Its parents out in this world that wouldn't allow their kids to read books that have bad things in them	23
19951	4041	Most parents find it offensive that book stores or other places sell these type of books to their children	24
19952	4041	The things authors talk about in their books and what they include no @CAPS5 should read	25
19953	4041	Books that aren't good for certain age groups or that have inaproprate things in it should be removed from the shelves	26
19954	4041	But certain people interpret the words different and veiw it different	27
19955	4041	Its many books out in this world that most parents or grandparents hope their kids or grandkids never take off the shelf	28
19956	4041	But its going to keep going on until someone speaks up.	29
19957	4042	The material we read in books are sometimes offensive	0
19958	4042	Books that are offensive should be supervised as to who gets to view them	1
19959	4042	I believe that every parent has the right to oversee what there child reads	2
19960	4042	I also believe that Censorship is a good thing sometimes     The material we find in books is not as much of a proplem to our youth as any other thing	3
19961	4042	The reasoning for me saying this is that youth to day are not really woried about picking up a book and reading is as much as them picking up a magazine, cellular phone, iPod or using a computer	4
19962	4042	I believe magazines are worse than any book	5
19963	4042	Books are reed mostly for knowledge wereas magazines are mostly reed for people to catch up on the latest trends	6
19964	4042	Magazines can lead to people listing to the next hotest band, singer or rapper, whatever	7
19965	4042	Music that you hear on the radio is filled with suggestive lyrics	8
19966	4042	Then people get pulled in	9
19967	4042	Music doesn't have rating were movies do	10
19968	4042	Movies are a little easier to control because of there ratings but children are alway going to get there hands on it no matter what	11
19969	4042	This is were the internet comes into play	12
19970	4042	Most people have acsess to a computer	13
19971	4042	Children could be on the internet for hours looking up things that aren't ment for them to see	14
19972	4042	Internet is also use to educate	15
19973	4042	The internet also opens up the doors to video games	16
19974	4042	Children can play with there friends all around the world now without leaving there bedroom	17
19975	4042	They also play with complete stranger	18
19976	4042	Some of the other player could be a bad influence to them because they were influenced by music, magazines, music, ect.., that send a bad message	19
19977	4042	No one is ever going to be able to control what our youth see	20
19978	4042	The only way is to close our libraries and shut down the internet	21
19979	4042	Even if we do this there could always still be away.	22
19980	4043	One book or movie doesn't make a difference in the huge library full of books and movies	0
19981	4043	Thats why the books, magazines, or movies shouldn't be removed from the book shelf of the library	1
19982	4043	They shouldnt be removed because some parents of the children don't care what their kids listen to or read	2
19983	4043	Only if they are doing what the parent says	3
19984	4043	Also the parents might think to much of their kid and think that their kid knows what books you want them to get or don't get	4
19985	4043	Although, if your one of those parents that not only care about what your children read or listen, and you realize that every kid doesnt know what their parent wants, then you should talk to the school's principle and see if there is a way that you could come up with an area of the library that is just for the books that have the wrong type of language or sex appeal that you don't want your children to have, or ever read, or you could ask them about a permission slip for the students to ask their parent if they care about these types of books	5
19986	4043	Then there are some kids who like to read those types of books and would be very dissappointed if their favorite books got taken off the shelf, and they didn't have anything else to read, but everybody else in the school got to have their favorite books in school	6
19987	4043	If someone where to tell me that the book is changing their lives into something that is unbearable	7
19988	4043	I would say to them that, its not the book	8
19989	4043	The kids chose to read the book in the first place, so it would be their own doing if their life changed	9
19990	4043	Finally, thats the reason why books shouldnt be taken off the book shelf because some people like them, and if you are some of the kids or parents who dont like them or don't want their kids reading them, then have the librarian make a note to say they aren't aloud to check them out	10
19991	4044	Author Katherine Paterson once commented, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
19992	4044	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exctly the same right and so does everyone else	1
19993	4044	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'	2
19994	4044	Many people in society share Katherine's view, while some belive in strict library censorship	3
19995	4044	It is important not to infringe on the rights of other people, surpress freedom of speech, or limit their knowledge	4
19996	4044	Therefore, I support her sentiment	5
19997	4044	If materials are thought to be innnapropriate for children ,or others for that matter, then censorship needs to be set up in the home by the parents, not by a public institution	6
19998	4044	America was founded upon the need for freedom: freedom of speech, of religion, and press	7
19999	4044	If we start to change that or limit what press a library can or cannot have, we are destroying a nation's core values	8
20000	4044	Can we turn our back on what our forefathers knew we had the right to	9
20001	4044	Furthermore, if we start to take a few 'offensive' books off the shelf, where do we draw the line	10
20002	4044	Anybody can claim almost any book is 'offensive' in some way, shape, or form, that does not mean we should immeadiatly take it off the shelf of an important public institution	11
20003	4044	If you do not want to take my word for it, look back at histroy	12
20004	4044	What kind of civilization was @LOCATION1	13
20005	4044	Not one you would want to live in I suppose	14
20006	4044	Hardly anyone would, and one of the things they controlled most was personal freedom	15
20007	4044	They started it off with the seemingly small act of censoring books	16
20008	4044	First, it was just viewed as unsavory to have a book they deemed offensive, in this case it was the works of @CAPS1, @CAPS2-@CAPS3, or @CAPS4 authors	17
20009	4044	Later on they started to burn theese books, and punish people for having them in thier possesion	18
20010	4044	If we are to live in a country, where a man has the rights he should have, then we cannot censor library books	19
20011	4044	This seemingly harmless act could have much greater consequnces than foreseen	20
20012	4044	Many families have different values they want to pass on to their children, morals they hope to teach them	21
20013	4044	The problem is, is that each families' limits and values are unique	22
20014	4044	We cannot just assume anything about families in general	23
20015	4044	I personally know a family that is very protective over what their children read, watch or listen to	24
20016	4044	On the other hand, I am aquainted with a family who allows their children more freedom to choose what they read	25
20017	4044	What one set of parents want to limit their child from reading @MONTH1 vary from another set of parents	26
20018	4044	If they find material they do not want their children to read, then they should censor in the home	27
20019	4044	They could start with a disscusion about why the material is inapropriate, and give the child the responsibility to obey their parents	28
20020	4044	It helps the parents become more involved in their childrens' lives and it aids the children in personal growth with responsiblity and respect	29
20021	4044	In the end, it all boils down to freedom	30
20022	4044	Do we want to live in a counrty with freedom of press and the right to publicly access it	31
20023	4044	My answer is yes, and I belive it is the answer of my fellow @CAPS5 too	32
20024	4044	We cannot clearly draw the line between 'offensive' and 'okay' because we are all different	33
20025	4044	Therefore we cannot bring our opinions down on the public instituion, but the home	34
20026	4044	It is not right to limit a whole society on what they have public access to because of one opinion.	35
20027	4045	Most people consider libraries an unharmful place	0
20028	4045	However it's often found that some libraries have offensive books as well as magazines on it's shelves	1
20029	4045	Kids that are interested in reading can't be looking for a book and pick up a @CAPS1 novel with a nude lady on the cover	2
20030	4045	I do believe libraries need to have some sort of censorship on not only their shelves but computers and movies as well	3
20031	4045	Let me further explain to you the reasons why libraries should have such boundaries	4
20032	4045	A library is a place to get away and explore your mind in a fascinating way	5
20033	4045	by reading books	6
20034	4045	Now would you want to be looking for one of your favorite books and find an offensive image	7
20035	4045	Nudity, cursing, and drugs are all offensive images I have seen in a library	8
20036	4045	It's not appealing to see an article about some sort of alcohol when its sitting right next to a kid's magazine	9
20037	4045	What kind of message are we trying to send to them	10
20038	4045	That it's ok to get drunk or have sex and read the magic school bus	11
20039	4045	I think there needs to be some kind of organization set up to go around and help censor libraries	12
20040	4045	Since the media controls the internet and most of the magazines, I think it would be a great idea to dispose of that in our libraries	13
20041	4045	Libraries are a reading playground for not only our children but friends and family as well	14
20042	4045	We don't want our kids getting the wrong message when they go check a book out and pick out an autobiography on @PERSON1	15
20043	4045	Censorship does need to occur in our libraries and I believe it should happen soon	16
20044	4045	I'm not saying go and wipe out all the books you have already purchased at sometime because that's already in the past	17
20045	4045	No matter where you are you cannot escape offensive gestures	18
20046	4045	but please let's keep it out of the library.	19
20047	4046	Do you want your children to have bad images in their head	0
20048	4046	Does everybody deserve to read or watch anything they want	1
20049	4046	I believe strongly that these materials should be removed from libraries in most cases	2
20050	4046	Offensive materials have no business being in libraries	3
20051	4046	These materials are not good for children, offend people, and do not look good on the libraries that carry them	4
20052	4046	First, I believe there is absolutely no reason for any child to see explicit material	5
20053	4046	This material can create a very ambitious young child	6
20054	4046	If a child sees a magazine containing pornography, the child will think that this material is acceptable	7
20055	4046	The truth is, that child should not know about anything of this subject until he or she receives approval from his/her parents	8
20056	4046	I know from experience that most parents would not want one of their children to see any of this material for a very extensive time	9
20057	4046	I have had a few disturbing experiences myself	10
20058	4046	One time when I was a young lad, I checked out a horror movie from the local library not knowing what the movie was about	11
20059	4046	I made sure my parents were not home when I watched it	12
20060	4046	After about three minutes, I was terrified	13
20061	4046	The images from the film stayed in my head for a good month	14
20062	4046	Children do not deserve the feeling of fear for that long of a time	15
20063	4046	Next, some material in the library contain certain things that offend random people	16
20064	4046	Large public libraries contain music with explicit lyrics	17
20065	4046	We, as a society, do not want our youth to hear the nasty words in some of the rap songs that are released	18
20066	4046	In addition to that, this music offends many adults as well	19
20067	4046	Adults agree that there is no reason for any rap to be released in a public place like a library	20
20068	4046	Music is a very great art, but when certain people abuse it, it no longer has a good image	21
20069	4046	I have observed that children listening to rap at a very young age are more likely to end up turning out to be an unsuccessful individual	22
20070	4046	Also, some specific magazines contain images that are offensive to the people of our society	23
20071	4046	This idea relates to my first idea, but I will speak some of it again	24
20072	4046	Images like blood can sometimes offend the people of our generation	25
20073	4046	We do not need any of this	26
20074	4046	If offensive material was banned from libraries, our society would have eliminated one more problem that is taking away from our good world	27
20075	4046	I have been offended of some different magazine pictures before	28
20076	4046	Someday when I have kids, I will never let them go to certain sections of the library with this material	29
20077	4046	Last, I want to address the fact that specific libraries can carry a bad reputation if they carry this material	30
20078	4046	In addition, employees will definitely go to a different library without the bad music and the violent movies	31
20079	4046	Most of the adults that want their children to be successful and have a good, creative mind will think twice about going to the library without censorship of certain items	32
20080	4046	I have read that libraries with bad material are much less likely to attract customers than libraries with censorship	33
20081	4046	I know that if I was the manager of a public library, I would make sure that any items that have the potential to offend people would be immediately removed	34
20082	4046	A library should definitely not want that bad gossip to go around town about how bad that specific library is	35
20083	4046	Censorship is as necessary to libraries as flavor is to food	36
20084	4046	Shelves that contain inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only make their number of customers drop	37
20085	4046	If you think that this is only going to help libraries, I dare you to go ahead and try it out	38
20086	4046	Everyone has their own opinions, but I am a firm believer in censorship at public and private libraries	39
20087	4046	Inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only destroy the good reputation that a library @MONTH1 have	40
20088	4046	A library is a great place to be, but the libraries without censorship are an utter disappointment	41
20089	4046	After all, it is your life, and you get to choose the way you want your children to act	42
20090	4046	Disturbing materials are only going to bring a negative effect on these minors	43
20091	4046	I hope to see the amount of censorship rise in libraries	44
20092	4046	If it does, people will see a dramatic change in all of my ideas discussed.	45
20093	4047	As the Katherine Paterson's quote states everyone in fact has the right to take books, movies, magazines and other items off the shelves if deemed offensive or inappropriate	0
20094	4047	However this should be their decision and only their's	1
20095	4047	not other parents rallying together to get their desired results	2
20096	4047	the removal of certain books	3
20097	4047	In todays times so much is viewed as offensive or inappropriate that wasn't when the previous generations read them	4
20098	4047	When parents read these things today they feel these items are inappropriate versus when they were teenagers they felt it was appropriate	5
20099	4047	Of course in todays technological age kids can lay their hands on just about anything if they know how to	6
20100	4047	So, if parents begin censoring items there is one incentive or reason for them to read or listen to it	7
20101	4047	and disobey parents	8
20102	4047	They also get receive an unconventional or unintended education	9
20103	4047	So if parents censor the kids have been given a multitude of reasons to go against their parents wishes and read or listen to it anyway	10
20104	4047	So that is why parents shouldn't censor what their kids read, listen to, or see because eventually they will see it	11
20105	4047	Do you want that?	12
20106	4048	The topic of library censoring has been increasing over the past few years	0
20107	4048	It has been discussed by many people, but a decision has never been reached	1
20108	4048	I say that there should be no library censoring	2
20109	4048	I would not have found my love for reading if libraries were censored like they are	3
20110	4048	I think that there should be no censoring of libraries	4
20111	4048	It would impair our basic rights	5
20112	4048	Such as our right to freedom of expression	6
20113	4048	And our right freedom to the press.We would no longer live in a free country but a totalterrian state	7
20114	4048	Though if they would put an age restriction on certian things that @MONTH1 please the debators	8
20115	4048	I think that many would agree to this if it was proposed 	9
20116	4048	Thus, if we did this children would only be able to read or listen to materials apporiate for their age	10
20117	4048	Though it is the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to not the libraries	11
20118	4048	It's the parents who introducee the children to music, magazines, and books	12
20119	4048	If the parents started to censor these materials early on this debate would not be going on as it is	13
20120	4048	The topic of library censoring has been discussed and debated at increasing rates over that past years	14
20121	4048	Some want to censor our libraries though that is not the best choice	15
20122	4048	@PERSON1 said 'that if we have the right to censor libraries then thier will be no more books for any of us.	16
20123	4049	I do not believe that such things as book, music, movies, magazines,etc., should be removed from libraries	0
20124	4049	First, books can be used as monumental learning sources for kids, teenagers, and adults	1
20125	4049	Just because a book talks about the @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 dying @MONTH1 be a little inappropriate for some age groups but not for teenagers and adults	2
20126	4049	Also books give a message about how times use to be	3
20127	4049	Take a book that refers to slavery and what they use to call black @CAPS9 back then	4
20128	4049	Just because it has some words that are frowned upon does not mean that kids and @CAPS9 shouldn't know about it and where it came from so they won't go around affending @CAPS9 and they don't even know what the word means	5
20129	4049	Next, movies now some movies shouldn't be played for certain age groups and I understand that, but movies like @CAPS2 and To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4 @CAPS5 are teaching us our @ORGANIZATION1 and how far we've come from being segregated and the disrespect of each others race	6
20130	4049	Also movies gives a more visual way of what things were like so we can kind of get a interactive way on how things look like and how you can relate the book to the movie	7
20131	4049	Movies also make points, some state if we don't do anything about pollution this is whats going to happen	8
20132	4049	So movies are definetly a stay on my list	9
20133	4049	In addition, a big factor of @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION1 is music	10
20134	4049	I could see how some music could be bad but also some artist talk  about how it really is tough where they come from and how music is a get away for them	11
20135	4049	Plus, music isn't hurting anybody	12
20136	4049	We learn how music was in the @DATE1 and compare it to music now	13
20137	4049	We also learn how music evolves from one thing to another, kind of creating off of itself	14
20138	4049	Music has the power to say things and communicate with @CAPS9 and make statements that could only be made by music	15
20139	4049	For example, take somebody giving a speech about what they feel or what they think	16
20140	4049	Now take that speech put it in a song form and I guarantee that more @CAPS9 capture the message and take it into there grasp on how they could help the cause	17
20141	4049	Especially if it is by their favorite artist	18
20142	4049	Say your favorite artist is @CAPS7 @PERSON1, now wouldn't you rather listen to @CAPS7 @PERSON1 make a statement about life or a political view rather than a song like that by @ORGANIZATION2	19
20143	4049	So music is most definetly staying on the list because it has the power to move @CAPS9, make you feel different ways, and look at things you've never seen in away before	20
20144	4049	Last, magazines, some Magazines are just inappropriate	21
20145	4049	Now I'm pretty sure that you will not be seing those magazines on shelves of a library so nobody should be worried about that	22
20146	4049	Now some magazines like @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS11 are just there for fun and they are not hurting anybody because its just pictures and honestly no child would read the words of a interview with a famous person	23
20147	4049	So magazines are harmless to in a library and are only there to stay up on current events and to inform @CAPS9 on if a new discovery was made or whats going on in the @ORGANIZATION1	24
20148	4049	In conclusion, I do not believe that things such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves anywhere.	25
20149	4051	Libraries	0
20150	4051	What things are found in libraries	1
20151	4051	Well libraries contain more then just books	2
20152	4051	They can have music, movies, magazines, books, and much more	3
20153	4051	All of the things are not for just one particular age	4
20154	4051	Libraries have things for people of all ages, even though some do not like many of the materials found in them	5
20155	4051	The library in my town has certin place for chilrden, teens, adults, and for @CAPS1-rated thing	6
20156	4051	Not all people agree with what should be aloud in a public area	7
20157	4051	Libraries try to make everyone that comes find something that might be intersting to them	8
20158	4051	Even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects	9
20159	4051	When I go to the library I think I would mind is i saw some @CAPS1-rated thing	10
20160	4051	Even though I think everyone should have the freedom to read, watch, listen, and hear about what they want	11
20161	4051	I think making areas where children can't go is a good way of letting people get what they want to get and not exposing it to younger people	12
20162	4051	Haveing these areas would help parents and childern feel alot better about what they would hear or see at a library	13
20163	4051	What can be done about this problem	14
20164	4051	Even though it @MONTH1 cost more or be to dificult for an ower of a library to do, I think that building rooms for different age groups would be an good thing to do	15
20165	4051	If smaller children see thing such as violace, durgs, and sex, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to do	16
20166	4051	Most parents try and keep there kids away for those parts of library but don't always sucide	17
20167	4051	So there for I think that building rooms for these area is the right thing to do	18
20168	4051	Even though we all think different things should or shoulden't be seen in public, we can't stop them from being there	19
20169	4051	We could try to contain them to where only people that would like to see them do	20
20170	4051	It would just cost a little more money then some are willing to spend, but if you think of when you were a child would you of liked to see some of those things	21
20171	4051	If u ever have kids whould you like for them to see it	22
20172	4051	I would hope not	23
20173	4051	So try and make the better choic when u find unupropret things for unger viewers.	24
20174	4052	As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'  I think we all can agree with @CAPS2	0
20175	4052	We have all read something that we did not necessarily want to finish or that we wish we had not read	1
20176	4052	I, however, believe that these materials should not be taken off of the shelves and be put out of reach of our youth, or adults	2
20177	4052	When you take away materials that some people use to learn, you take away their ability to learn	3
20178	4052	Yes, they @MONTH1 choose another book and learn from it too but it should not be our choice to dictate what they can and can not read.Take for example the popular internet video clip, '@CAPS1 guys one hammer.'  @CAPS2 is a video of two guys beating a homeless man to death with a hammer and screwdriver	4
20179	4052	I have never seen @CAPS2 movie and listening to my friends talk about it, I do not want to	5
20180	4052	@CAPS2 seems like a gruesome and horrific video clip that would scar me for life, but it is a perfect example for @CAPS2 because what some do not want to learn from, others can	6
20181	4052	I would never watch @CAPS2 or anything like @CAPS2 but my friends who have watched @CAPS2 have learned something	7
20182	4052	That is that you should be successful in life because if you are homeless then you could be beaten to death by some teenagers who are looking to have some 'fun.'  I kid you not, after hearing about @CAPS2 sad video it has inspired me to be a successful person and not become homeless	8
20183	4052	@CAPS2 brings us back to the main point - had someone said, 'No, @CAPS2 video can not be on the internet.' none of my friends would have seen @CAPS2 or told me about it	9
20184	4052	Therefore I would not be driven to be a good student and a good person	10
20185	4052	Then, when I was older I would have become homeless and would have had the chance to be the star in one of these videos	11
20186	4052	You can be sure that that is not something that I would want to be.In conclusion, I believe we should not interfere with some people's right to learn	12
20187	4052	We should not take away materials that can be used to learn no matter how bad we think they are, because you never know, one man's pain is another man's learning tool	13
20188	4052	If we all took away the materials that we felt were innappropriate or needed censorship then we would have very few learning materials left	14
20189	4052	As Katherine Paterson said, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'	15
20190	4053	Coming from a teenager, @CAPS1 offensive books, magazines and movies should be removed from a local library	0
20191	4053	A library is a place to go relax and read	1
20192	4053	Most books and movies are filled with sex,gang violence, and drugs	2
20193	4053	In my generation sex, durgs and, gang violence seem to be high at risk everywhere	3
20194	4053	Books are suppose to be about learning	4
20195	4053	Offensive books and movies set bad habit on younger children.These are the reasons offensive books movies and also magazine should be removed from our local libraries	5
20196	4053	Sex, gang violence, and drugs seem to appear everywhere in my generation	6
20197	4053	Whenever you open your magazine you find different topics, but they all deal with either sex, drugs, or violence	7
20198	4053	Children should never be exposed to that type of  offensive behavor	8
20199	4053	You should be able to open a magazine and   learn somthing brand new	9
20200	4053	Books are good for reseach paper and other school project, but sometimes you cant find what you are looking for because of other topics	10
20201	4053	Reason you cant find what your looking for is because every book or magazine you look threw is covred with  the topic you dont want	11
20202	4053	As a teenager each book I look at its always about sex or gang violence	12
20203	4053	If younger children, countiued to read about bad topics, it will create a bad habit on that child	13
20204	4053	They say you are involved  with what you read	14
20205	4053	Bad habit could lead to many things, such as killing, smoking , and pregnacy's	15
20206	4053	Thats why all parents should have guidence over there children	16
20207	4053	Being who I am , there should never be any offensive books, movies, and magazine in a local library	17
20208	4053	Offensive books and movies can cause many problems	18
20209	4053	It drive children where they sont need to be, and you wont be able to learn if you have to many bad habit	19
20210	4053	there should only be book and movies where you a re able to learn something in your local library.	20
20211	4054	The @CAPS1,     I read an intresting @CAPS2 the other day by Katherine Paterson an author	0
20212	4054	The @CAPS2 said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	1
20213	4054	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- the work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	2
20214	4054	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'      I believe that people should not have the right to take matieral such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc	3
20215	4054	of the shelf of a library, or anywhere else those items are displayed	4
20216	4054	So I agree %@NUM1 with Paterson because people have their own opions	5
20217	4054	Some stuff @MONTH1 be more offensive than others to different people	6
20218	4054	I have observed people, and were all different so why should our thoughts be to	7
20219	4054	The answer is yes they should be different	8
20220	4054	But it is pretty simple if you find a book, song, movie, or magazine that you find offensive or distasteful then put it back another person might find it intresting	9
20221	4054	I want to know the thoughts of my fellow citizens about what Paterson has said	10
20222	4054	I am asking for your help to do so	11
20223	4054	I would like you to put the @CAPS2 in The @CAPS1 and hear what people have to say about it	12
20224	4054	Thank You for accepting my @CAPS4	13
20225	4054	@PERSON2	14
20226	4055	Most of us have had times when we are really into a book or magazine that we are reading, and all of a sudden we come across vulgar language, pictures, or activities that are not suitable for us	0
20227	4055	Why did the author have to throw this in the book	1
20228	4055	Why didn't the back of the book tell me that there was offensive behavior in this book	2
20229	4055	Why is this magazine in the library with risky pictures	3
20230	4055	It @MONTH1 even make some people not interested in that specific author anymore, or quite possibly persuade someone to stop visiting that library	4
20231	4055	Certain materials in libraries should be removed	5
20232	4055	The first reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because it is not suitable for children or even young teenagers	6
20233	4055	Let's say your child is at the library and they pick up a random book to check it out	7
20234	4055	Turns out, the summary of the story on the back is actually about college kids partying and participating in illegal activities	8
20235	4055	Your child on the other hand, does not read the summary and just wants the book based on the moral of the story, interesting cover, and critic reviews	9
20236	4055	If your child reads that book with vulgar language and illegal activities, you are most likely going to be upset	10
20237	4055	The second reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the books and other materials with offensive material can be placed in book stores, instead of the public library	11
20238	4055	In that case, parents can feel more content with having their children read any material at the library	12
20239	4055	Adults and older teenagers can still have their material choice, they will just have to take a trip to the bookstore to find what they need	13
20240	4055	They @MONTH1 not get to check out items for free like at the library, but it will be safer for the children and young teenagers	14
20241	4055	Not to mention, the people who respect their morals too much to read offensive material	15
20242	4055	The third reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the library should be ordered to state on the back of the book, magazine, movies, etc., in any way they choose, if the book contains anything that @MONTH1 be taken as offensive to a reader	16
20243	4055	That way, if someone is questioning the summary of the book, a risky title, or cover illustration, they can flip to the back to see if it will be tolerable for them	17
20244	4055	Libraries should remove certain materials from the shelves	18
20245	4055	It will create a more civil trip to the library	19
20246	4055	No more worries about accidentely coming upon a sentence or chapter in a book that is against someone's morals	20
20247	4055	Or flipping through pages in a magzine and seeing a picture that offends you	21
20248	4055	Libraries will contain safe books for all ages, while bookstores can have the pleasure of having offensive material on their shelves	22
20249	4055	It's a win win situation.	23
20250	4056	Should books that seem offensive to you be put off of the selves	0
20251	4056	I know that most people who agree that it would 'better' our kids if the didn't read or listen to certain things	1
20252	4056	But, what would happen if everything that we thought was wrong was taken off of the self	2
20253	4056	I do not think that we have any right to take a book off of shelves because of it contens	3
20254	4056	If I look at a certain book and think, '@CAPS1 book is offending me and my beleives,' then I should just not read the book	4
20255	4056	Just becauseit is offensive to me doesn't mean it will offened someone else	5
20256	4056	Every book that has ever been written has effect someone, either in a good way or a bad way	6
20257	4056	Does that mean they have the right to say, 'take them off the shelves?'      I remember when I was in second grade, there was these girl in my class who's mother came in to complain about my teacher playing gospel music while we worked	7
20258	4056	The parent was extremly engery at the teacher and, at that time, I didn't know why.Now I realize that it was because they didn't believe in what the lyrics in the song were saying	8
20259	4056	The teacher never played the music in class again and was to afraid to play anyother type of music	9
20260	4056	Since everyones views are different, by the time every person took off the books that offended them, there would be no books left	10
20261	4056	As Katherine Paterson put it, 'But if I have the right to remove that book form the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly that same right and so does everyone else	11
20262	4056	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     In conclusion, I strongly think that books, weather they offended someone or not, should be kept of the selves	12
20263	4056	Taking the book off wouldn't accomplish anything to begin with.	13
20264	4057	I think that we should have offensive materials on the shelfs in libraries	0
20265	4057	People have their own ideas and opinions about offensive material like @CAPS1 shouldnt be around in libraries for children to read or we should have offensive material because @CAPS1 might help someone one day	1
20266	4057	Some times when people think of offensive material they think of bad and not good for people to read or watch because @CAPS1's not treating people right	2
20267	4057	Then also some offensive material like videos or movie can be very fun and make the movie great to watch	3
20268	4057	Today im hear to tell that offensive material can help students in high school research for a project, @CAPS1 can also show us how offensive materials were back in the old days, and @CAPS1 can also teach us more about offensive material	4
20269	4057	Today in are generation we do alot of studing or projects for school, we do this so we know more about the subject	5
20270	4057	As a high school student i would research the topic about offensive material	6
20271	4057	Why would you ask i do this	7
20272	4057	Because of researching this offensive material you can learn more about @CAPS1	8
20273	4057	Like where did @CAPS1 come from, why people are offensive, you could probably find out more than what you know and thats a good thing finding out what you dont know	9
20274	4057	So if we take away the offensive material we would never get to learn more about @CAPS1 or know where @CAPS1 came from	10
20275	4057	Its good to still have have books that are  offensive material because you get educated not to be offensive	11
20276	4057	Going to a library is fun and exciteding because you get to read all these books	12
20277	4057	Well when you choose a book you can choose the most recent one or the one back from the old days	13
20278	4057	In are case we have offensive material on the shelfs in libraries	14
20279	4057	Lets just say here you went to the library today and you wanted to research a paper on offensive material from the old days	15
20280	4057	Well in the library they will have generations of  books on offensive material	16
20281	4057	This provides us of offensive material back in the old days	17
20282	4057	So the library is a good thing to have that because we need to know  about what happend back in the old days	18
20283	4057	Everyone one goes to a library to learn more about what they like to do or read a really good book	19
20284	4057	Well i know alot of people that would love to learn more about offensive material	20
20285	4057	Offensive material to people is like a good book you can read @CAPS1 and learn more about	21
20286	4057	Some people think learning to much is a bad thing exspecially when @CAPS1 is on offensive material	22
20287	4057	Learning to much is not even a discusion because people can learn whatever they want to	23
20288	4057	If the libraries take away the offensive material @CAPS1 is just like talking a good book from you	24
20289	4057	People can think what they want to think about offensive material	25
20290	4057	Like i said before if libraries take away offensive material book, its like taking away a good book from a reader	26
20291	4057	People do need to learn about offensive material thats why we still have the books	27
20292	4057	If we didnt want to know about offensive material why did they publish all the books and videos about @CAPS1	28
20293	4057	This is why i think we should have offensive material on the shelfs in libraries	29
20294	4058	To who it @MONTH1 concern:     @CAPS1 you take away books because someone might find them offensive	0
20295	4058	Do you believe racism is a part of liturature	1
20296	4058	Libraries are considering removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc	2
20297	4058	from their inventory for censorship	3
20298	4058	They believe individuals might take offense to certain types of beliefs from the different variety of entertainment that they have in their library	4
20299	4058	These types of entertainment should not be aloud to be removed from public or private libraries	5
20300	4058	In many libraries, their inventory is being stripped for censorship	6
20301	4058	This means that books, magazines, movies and music is being removed because some individuals might find it offensive	7
20302	4058	Individuals might disagree with certain beliefs concerning their lifestyle and what they believe	8
20303	4058	Liturature can be described as art that an individual portrays it as in his/her own way	9
20304	4058	It has been in the world since man first learned to write to present day	10
20305	4058	This means it has been there wars, politics, art and slavery	11
20306	4058	All of these are a part of liturature, so liturature is history in it's own way	12
20307	4058	Some say offensive material should be taken out of libraries	13
20308	4058	they might think that it should be removed from everywhere	14
20309	4058	It should not	15
20310	4058	It is a part of history	16
20311	4058	@CAPS1 you take away an era of history just because you find it offensive	17
20312	4058	I know I wouldn't	18
20313	4058	It tells us what was happening at that certain time	19
20314	4058	It tells us what was happening in that part of the world	20
20315	4058	It tells us what the opinions were of people at that time	21
20316	4058	Many people believe racism is wrong, but we shouldn't believe that no one thought it was right	22
20317	4058	Many people thought is was right	23
20318	4058	They might believe white skin is superior over dark skin, but we should respect their beliefs in return that they respect our's	24
20319	4058	Liturature is important to society and how it works	25
20320	4058	Without it, we wouldnt be where we were today	26
20321	4058	Liturature should stay in the shelves of libraries where they belong	27
20322	4058	Personal opinions are a part of books, and we should respect that	28
20323	4058	@CAPS1 you want to be know for destroying an important part of history	29
20324	4059	Many people have different views and opinions on things	0
20325	4059	No opinion or view is right or wrong	1
20326	4059	Books, music, and movies of controversy shouldn't be removed from shelves because not everybody finds them offensive, people have the right to view them, and others can't make the desicion for everyone	2
20327	4059	Everybody is entitled to their own views and opinions, but they can't make others see things their way	3
20328	4059	If someone was at a library, and thought the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series were offensive, they might be the only ones to think that	4
20329	4059	They can't tell the library to remove them because they're uncomfortable with the books	5
20330	4059	Things go by majorty rule, and that person is not the majorty	6
20331	4059	They're the only one with the problem	7
20332	4059	Everyone has the right to view or listen to what they want, as long as it's legal	8
20333	4059	If someone finds a type of music that they find offensive, they can't tell the store to remove it	9
20334	4059	One person can't change everything to fit their needs	10
20335	4059	They would be making plenty of people unhappy if that type of music was removed	11
20336	4059	To make everyone happy, the person could just not listen it	12
20337	4059	There's a huge selection of music a person could listen to, without being uncomfortable	13
20338	4059	One person cannot make the desicions for everyone	14
20339	4059	The president doesn't even make the desicions by himself	15
20340	4059	he has the government helping him	16
20341	4059	If one person felt as if a magazine was inappropriate, they don't have the right to change it	17
20342	4059	They're not the one in charge so they can't be the one to change the magazine	18
20343	4059	It might be inapprpriate, but other people enjoy reading it	19
20344	4059	I believe that everyone's entitled to their own opinions and views, but they shouldn't make everyone see it their way	20
20345	4059	Books, music, movies, and magazines are few of the things that people try to control because they're uncomfortable with the subject inside the material	21
20346	4059	Some of the stuff is inappropriate or offensive, but one person can't change it	22
20347	4059	Not everybody will find it offensive, people have the right to view, watch, or listen to what they want, and one person can't make desicions for everyone	23
20348	4060	Should someones work catagorized as 'inappropiate' or 'offensive' be taken off of a shelf and not able to be sold or seen in stores	0
20349	4060	If you believe so, then do you think it is okay for the campaigners that run for @CAPS1 be able to express their thoughts and opinions on different topics	1
20350	4060	This is exactly what is being done when someone writes an article or a book that they have published to be distributed into stores or libraries	2
20351	4060	When someone writes a book on something, they usually have a lot of interest in whatever topic they are discussing	3
20352	4060	Just as when @CAPS2 campaigners present themselves to the public and announce what party they will be running for and what their beliefs and disbeliefs are	4
20353	4060	If it is okay for someone to take a book off of a shelf, or even a magazine because people think the book is 'inappropiate' then maybe we should reconsider what the campaigners say on live @CAPS3	5
20354	4060	Even if you were to walk into a store and there be nude magazines on the shelf, or cd's with lyrics that contain cuss words do you feel those should be taken off of shelves as well	6
20355	4060	There is a time and a place for where things like this should not be displayed	7
20356	4060	For example, when you go to a little kids store and things like this are being sat out for the kids to see, they will not forget what they saw or heard if referring to music	8
20357	4060	Kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered	9
20358	4060	Like when they read a story and it includes someone robbing a bank, or a song that refers to drinking or doing some form of drug	10
20359	4060	When kids see or even hear things like this, they are more likely to try things that we would hope little kids would not try	11
20360	4060	When someone spends months or even years on writing a story, they hope that they can get it published and be rewarded for their long, hard work	12
20361	4060	By doing this they try and get it to be published, and put in stores so people can buy it	13
20362	4060	Whether or not if your talking about music, movies, or books, its all the same	14
20363	4060	Things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available	15
20364	4060	If things were going to be taken off of shelves or not put out onto display, people will stop recording music, acting out movies, or even writing ad's and books	16
20365	4060	When and if this were to happen, people will not become educated with new available data	17
20366	4060	If there is nobody to write science books, or biography's then nobody will learn about new things	18
20367	4060	Same with music and movies, if people spend a few months or even a year writing a new album, or coming up with an idea for a movie and they work hard to get it done, they expect to get it out to the public	19
20368	4060	If its finally out and people have the chance to buy it, they hope it will stay available	20
20369	4060	If it doesn't and people think the movie is 'inappropiate' then the song writers and actors will more then likely not have the urge to do it all over again	21
20370	4060	In conclusion, I think that if someone writes something or records something that has taken them a good amount of work and time that they should be rewarded and allowed to have their item sold	22
20371	4060	If someone belives that an item is 'inappropiate' then they should keep their comments to themselves, and not have the item taken off display	23
20372	4060	There are some people out there that enjoy things that are not 'appropiate' and they think its funny	24
20373	4060	Surely if the write or producer got a book or movie produced they thought it was good, and they believe that people will buy their product	25
20374	4060	So, if the writer thinks this, surely there is someone out there that feels the same	26
20375	4060	How are we to know if there is someone out there that agrees, and enjoys the book or movie if it has been taken off of the shelf because someone thought the material was 'inappropiate.'	27
20376	4061	What if someone told you that you couldn't wear a yellow shirt because it was offensive	0
20377	4061	What if they said you couldn't look a certain way because you might offend somebody	1
20378	4061	Not just one person or group of people have the right to decide what is suitable and what is not	2
20379	4061	There are so many different religions and traditions throughout the @LOCATION2 it would be completely rediculous to set one standard for all people	3
20380	4061	If @CAPS1 aren't restricted when it comes to apperal, groceries, or automobiles, why should there be limits in the libraries	4
20381	4061	Libraries should not be censored because not only would censorship limit the resoursfulness of the libraries and smother the knowledge intake across the @LOCATION2, but it would also pose a threat to our future	5
20382	4061	When one takes a trip to the library, one would expect to find a book, magazine, and/or movie on just about anything	6
20383	4061	It would be extremely frustrating to find that a library, which is supposed to contain content on nearly every subject, does not have what your looking for	7
20384	4061	Say a book on the asassination of @PERSON1 is what you fancy, so you ask the librarian where you could find it	8
20385	4061	You would be dissapointed if she says they don't carry assassination books because they are too vulgar for young children	9
20386	4061	This could become very troubling and would limit the library's resources	10
20387	4061	Not only would censorship in libraries limit the content but it would also limit learning in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 are people supposed to stay informed if they are being sheilded from knowledge	11
20388	4061	Many people that do not have computers depend on the library	12
20389	4061	If they cannot get what they need at the library where would they go	13
20390	4061	The libraries would lose business and funding if they did not supply library-goers with the content which they desire	14
20391	4061	People would take their business elsewhere	15
20392	4061	Protests @MONTH1 break out and rebelious citizens @MONTH1 protest the censorship, causing an uproar in society	16
20393	4061	The people would not be the only thing out of hand	17
20394	4061	The censorship would surely get out of hand, aswell	18
20395	4061	@CAPS1 are already being censored through news stations, radio, and tv shows	19
20396	4061	Libraries are a place where infinant knowledge is realistic and that is comforting for many @CAPS1	20
20397	4061	In libraries people choose what they learn: they aren't forced teachers or parents	21
20398	4061	The censorship @MONTH1 start out as a small intervention, but it could turn our nation upside down	22
20399	4061	Next thing we know, our desisions could be influenced by the books that only 'they' decide are suitable	23
20400	4061	What kind of society would we have then	24
20401	4061	Individuality would be lost and opinions would be forgotten	25
20402	4061	Clearly, censorship in libraries is dangerous and unpredictable	26
20403	4061	If libraries were cencored, not only would  knowledge in the @LOCATION2 desinegrate, but libraries would lose their respect and threaten the future of @LOCATION1	27
20404	4061	No one tells me what to wear or say, so why should anyone tell me what to read	28
20405	4061	We are all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs	29
20406	4061	Our @CAPS4 @CAPS5 earned us our freedoms, we can not let censorship take them away	30
20407	4062	@PERSON1 @NUM1 @DATE2, @DATE1                                   @CAPS1 @CAPS2           You should be able to read any book, listen to any music and watch any movie you want right	0
20408	4062	Well in some libraries that isn't always the case	1
20409	4062	Some people find books, music and movies offensive and not suitable for public libraries	2
20410	4062	In a public library I think that all books should be there to check out	3
20411	4062	The books might contain material that is more adult, but thats okay	4
20412	4062	For the books that are more inappropraite the library needs to offer an adult section	5
20413	4062	Just for the books that contain more adult material and are not suitable for younger readers	6
20414	4062	The person checking the book out should make the final decision if they think the book they have selected is right for them	7
20415	4062	Music in libraries should not be censorshiped	8
20416	4062	The lyrics might be inappropraite, but most teenagers listen to that type of music	9
20417	4062	For younger children they should not be able to check out a @CAPS3 that is more adult	10
20418	4062	In @CAPS1 opinion, for the music that is more adult you should be at least thirteen years old	11
20419	4062	Children under thirteen years of age should not have the option to check out that music	12
20420	4062	Some parents don't know what their child has checked out from the library	13
20421	4062	The child should have parent concent to check out any music if under the age requirement	14
20422	4062	I think that some movies should defenitely be removed if they are found offensive	15
20423	4062	Some movies have scenes that are horrible and that should be in the adult section	16
20424	4062	In a library you aren't expecting to find a movie that contains very adult material	17
20425	4062	At a movie rental store you would expect to find movies that are adult, but not in a public library	18
20426	4062	Movies for kids to check out should be educational, fun and most importantly, appropriate	19
20427	4062	Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that is exactly right	20
20428	4062	I would not want @CAPS1 little cousin reading books with racial comments and just plain out inappropraite content for a child that age	21
20429	4062	Even if the child doesn't understand what all of the content means, they will ask questions that the parent is most likely not ready to answer	22
20430	4062	As children,they might get the wrong idea in their head and say things that are not right	23
20431	4062	In public libraries books should not be censored movies should be censored and music should not	24
20432	4062	It all comes down to what do you allow your children to read, watch and listen	25
20433	4062	Its a debate that has gone through several libraries over the content of the material	26
20434	4062	Now that you know @CAPS1 opinion on censorshiped, maybe others will consider this an important topic, too	27
20435	4063	Freedom of speech is a keen aspect in @LOCATION1 and thats what made our country flourish through many years	0
20436	4063	In the constitution it states that there is freedom of the press, which means that if something is written that might affend some people, then they have to deal with it	1
20437	4063	Some might say that some material is offensive, which sometimes it is	2
20438	4063	However I do not think that the books, magazines, etc	3
20439	4063	should be taken off the shelfs due to the feelings of another persons thoughts	4
20440	4063	In @LOCATION1 over the years things have become more exceptable in media and books	5
20441	4063	The rights have always been there but not fully practised	6
20442	4063	There have been book burnings, banned books, and even people being killed for there writings	7
20443	4063	For many years it went on until @LOCATION1 changed its way of thinking to a broader more open perepective	8
20444	4063	Though it still goes on I think that it is very closed minded	9
20445	4063	In some cases people blamed books that had nothing to do with killing someone, for the reason why they commited a murder.I do think there is a limit to how you distibute certain books and magazines	10
20446	4063	They shouldnt sell a book about death,poverty,or sex at a public school	11
20447	4063	We all have diffrent things we like to read and write about	12
20448	4063	So why shoud we be taken away from because somone thinks its to offensive	13
20449	4063	I think not, if you dont like it then put it down and let someone pick it up who will read it	14
20450	4063	With my own experience i have seen bad people do what is expected of them , bad things	15
20451	4063	And they try to blame it on a book, story, or @CAPS1 show they had seen	16
20452	4063	Thats just a easy way out of a situation	17
20453	4063	I have read and saw very intense things in my life but does that make me want to do  bad things, no	18
20454	4063	I know i cant speak for everyone when I say that books, magazines etc	19
20455	4063	or not harmful	20
20456	4063	But think about it like this wouldn't sometimes the person reading the stories figure they could learn and embrace from it rather then go out and do what the character did in the story	21
20457	4063	Reading opens up new things and is scientificly proven to make you smarter in the long run	22
20458	4063	The more you read the more awareness and knowledge you gain ,and just becuase you read a book about something doesn't mean you support it	23
20459	4063	It could maybe mean that you want to learn about it so you can understand it more.	24
20460	4064	Nowadays, children can look on the shelves of libraries and find any type of reading you can imagine	0
20461	4064	Some magazines, books, and movies that are age appropriate	1
20462	4064	Children can also reach up on those same shelves and find some very inappropriate magazines, books, and movies	2
20463	4064	Should we remove these inappropriate items	3
20464	4064	Can we somehow get kids to not see them	4
20465	4064	Children are very curious	5
20466	4064	They want to know about everything and they will ask as many questions as they can	6
20467	4064	When they see inappropriate items on library shelves, what do we do	7
20468	4064	Libraries shouldn't get rid of items that @MONTH1 be inappropriate for children	8
20469	4064	Instead, there should be a rating system on the books and magazines	9
20470	4064	Movies have ratings so children don't see things that are inappropriate	10
20471	4064	books should have those ratings too	11
20472	4064	If someone wants to check out something that isn't suitable for kids, then they can show the libraian their @CAPS1	12
20473	4064	Everybody can check out what is appropriate for their age	13
20474	4064	Libraries could even put all of the most inappropriate items in a separate section of the library	14
20475	4064	It could be a section that kids could not enter	15
20476	4064	Parents should also watch their kids to make sure they aren't getting into anything inappropriate	16
20477	4064	The only censorship they should put into libraries is rating the items by maturity	17
20478	4064	Children can look onto the shelves, but we should put labels on what they can and can't check out	18
20479	4064	Parents could look out for what their children are trying to read	19
20480	4064	I believe that's the most we can do.	20
20481	4065	There are many libraries with many books, magzines,music, and movies	0
20482	4065	Some of the things in a library are inappropiate for children	1
20483	4065	So the library makes a section for the adult's and a section for the children	2
20484	4065	There should just be a children library and then make another library for the adult's	3
20485	4065	Then I also think that they should take the bad things of the shelf's at libraries	4
20486	4065	So there are children books and there adult books	5
20487	4065	In most libraries I seen that they either have and upstairs for the adult's and they have a downstairs for the kid's	6
20488	4065	They also have toy's down there for kids so if there parents want to go upstairs then the kids can sit there and play with the toy's	7
20489	4065	Then I also think that they should take off the bad things on the shelf's	8
20490	4065	Becuase wjat happens if a kid goes up with there mom or dad and opens a book and sees something very inappropiate	9
20491	4065	So they should be taken off the shelve's in a library, and if someone wants to buy them then will have to go online or to the store and buy them	10
20492	4065	The people that own the liobrary or are in the library should take all the bad magazines, music, books, and ect	11
20493	4065	off the shelf's	12
20494	4065	It is a very bad thing to have at a public place, and that should not be aloud	13
20495	4065	The public libraries should take all the inappropriate things of the shelf's	14
20496	4067	If we remove all books we think should't be on the shelves	0
20497	4067	What would there be to read	1
20498	4067	So many books have great detail in them to give us a vivid picture about what we're reading	2
20499	4067	Even at times the books we think are alright to read end up having a surprise that no one saw coming	3
20500	4067	I don't think we should have to remove books, music, movies etc., just because they are found offensive to some people	4
20501	4067	Instead of removing the books others love to read, what we should do is rate the books like we do movies and music	5
20502	4067	Or put the books some people find offensive in there own area	6
20503	4067	If all books were rated like movies, we would know just what were buying or checking out	7
20504	4067	Movies are rated by the language and content they have in it	8
20505	4067	Books should be the same way	9
20506	4067	Or if someone was to find a book or magazine offensive they should be put in a different location with a labe identifing that they could be offenisve to others	10
20507	4067	I do not think they should just be removed and out of the way	11
20508	4067	I think having books that are too offensive should be put in there own bookshelves	12
20509	4067	By doing this, people would know not to let there childeren go near them because they have been labled	13
20510	4067	And like rated '@CAPS1' movies a minor needs to be with an adut	14
20511	4067	But with books you should be find with your own choice at the age of @NUM1	15
20512	4067	In my opinion this would be a great idea to be done and should be done	16
20513	4067	There's a bunch of books i can think of that would not be suitable for young childeren	17
20514	4067	Yet little kids love to read and could easily take a book off the shelf if they so pleased	18
20515	4067	Many parents complain about what thier childeren read, watch, or listen to everyday	19
20516	4067	Labing would be such a great way to control a bit of what they hear and see each day	20
20517	4067	I think many parents would agree with my opinion and stand by it	21
20518	4067	I'm not saying to throw away the offensive books, music, movies, etc., but to labe them so others know what they are going to read or see	22
20519	4067	I believe this would be an excellent way to make sure our childeren don't read the things we as parents wouldn't want them to read or check out	23
20520	4068	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1,    I've recently finish reading a quote of the great author, Katherine Paterson, and her feelings towards the certain type of material use in books	0
20521	4068	For example some @CAPS1 @MONTH1 be offended be certain type of language used in books	1
20522	4068	Other @MONTH1 just feel the pictures are not quite approprite	2
20523	4068	With that being said, I believe that if there's a certain material presented in a book that you feel uncomfortable with, you should just pick up another book instead	3
20524	4068	My beliefe is that many authors feel like a book is a place where they can write their thoughts and beliefs about things that happen in this world	4
20525	4068	Authors shouldn't be denied the oppertunity to write a book just because of the way they express their feelings	5
20526	4068	@CAPS1 shouldn't be allow to give hateful opion just because they didn't like a book	6
20527	4068	As I see it no one is forcing them to read it	7
20528	4068	Now I'm not saying I'm a huge reading	8
20529	4068	As a matter of fact I barely read but when i do start reading I sometimes am eager to keep on reading	9
20530	4068	The way authors discribe things even with sometimes profanity is just amazing	10
20531	4068	You can actually feel that you're part of the book	11
20532	4068	Now then my point is that even though to many @CAPS1 a book @MONTH1 be horrible but to others it @MONTH1 be the best book in the world	12
20533	4068	So if you do start taking down books from the shelfs you would ended up with nothing but a huge, empty shelf	13
20534	4068	There's no book out there that is what we would consider, ' The perfect book.' @CAPS2 book can be given a nasty comment but then again @CAPS2 book can also be given the best comments	14
20535	4068	This world is to big to start picking and choosing	15
20536	4068	My beliefs won't be the same as yours but this is how i feel and this is how i will keep on feeling	16
20537	4068	So tell me, what's your belief then?	17
20538	4069	Have you ever went to a library and found that some books arn't really the best choice for younger kids to be reading	0
20539	4069	Well I am about to write a persuasive essay explaining what I think is best for younger children to be reading	1
20540	4069	I have went to multiple libraries and found that some books, magazines, and movies are way to extreme for kids to be reading/watching	2
20541	4069	I personaly think that children who arn't above @CAPS5 years old shouldn't be exposed of rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @NUM1 books, movies, or magazines	3
20542	4069	Children shouldn't have to know what adult movies, books, or magazines should look like at the age @NUM2	4
20543	4069	What I think kids should watch or read are @CAPS2 movies and books	5
20544	4069	Some of you are probly like 'but it's not like there going to know what it means.' @CAPS4 if children don't know what something means then that deffinantly won't stop them from saying it	6
20545	4069	Children learn by hands on or watching other things	7
20546	4069	They will eventually ask what does this mean or mommy what does this word mean	8
20547	4069	No parent is ready to tell there child at the age of three what a four letter word means	9
20548	4069	If you are one of the few parents that don't know how to explain things to your child then thats when you can bring out the older books/movies	10
20549	4069	But don't let them read it on there own	11
20550	4069	Usually kids will start asking about more adult things when the hit the age @CAPS5 and up	12
20551	4069	Thats when you as a parents can start letting them read and watch older movies and books	13
20552	4069	Tweleve years old is still a pretty young age for a kid to be reading and watching older movies on there own	14
20553	4069	Thats when you as a parent can sit down next to them and explain what is going on	15
20554	4069	As a kid we look up to our parents	16
20555	4069	We learn from seeing what you guys do	17
20556	4069	That is the exact same thing as reading and watching movies that are way to extreme for us at the age of ten	18
20557	4069	At the age of sixteen then usually kids are fine on there own they know what to expect	19
20558	4069	They know what is happening and they know how to handel it	20
20559	4069	In conclusion I think that rated @CAPS1 books, magazines and movies should be kept above ages one-@CAPS5	21
20560	4069	I think that kids will be better off learning about things that they need to know by the time middle school starts	22
20561	4069	Then once they hit highschool they will already know about what becoming an adult is all about	23
20562	4070	Many books, movies, and magazines are made for the different age groups of adults and children	0
20563	4070	I do agree that certain books are not approperiate for some children	1
20564	4070	Is it right for some parents to ban books from schools and libraries	2
20565	4070	Authors create books and stories because they like the idea, and students can wright what we want on paper because it's what we want it's called freedom	3
20566	4070	Schools can try to be creative and have a way to only allow books to the approperate age groups	4
20567	4070	Books are a great part of a students learning	5
20568	4070	Parents need to learn, and understand no matter how much they don'@CAPS1 like it that they can'@CAPS1 protect their children from the world some day they will be moved out of the house supporting themselves	6
20569	4070	How would childern and teens even know how to live or what and how to react to hearing a bad word or watching sexual on @CAPS1.V	7
20570	4070	If students never know how will they live	8
20571	4070	Books can be learning in many ways	9
20572	4070	Some things a teenager might be experiencing a parent might not want to talk about with their child	10
20573	4070	Maybe the family can'@CAPS1 afford to buy a pass to the public library	11
20574	4070	So the only other option is the school library books	12
20575	4070	If students can'@CAPS1 have access to then whats the option for them	13
20576	4070	Everyone knows how today's society is changing, if a student wants to learn about sex or @ORGANIZATION1's they should be able to if the age is approprite	14
20577	4070	All libraries check out books so the book is under a name	15
20578	4070	I know at our school students just come in and take the books instead of checking them out, but some students do still use the card and check the book out	16
20579	4070	If schools had books that our for only a certain age group a soultion to getting the older students to check them out and only the right age could be the books are in a case that is locked up	17
20580	4070	So for the student to have the book unlocked and checked they have an electronic key to unlock books for the age group they are in	18
20581	4070	When the student unlocks the book and goes to check it out the computer knows what books that specific student can get	19
20582	4070	Books are very important to learning and all books need to stay and not get blocked by  parents.	20
20583	4071	Censorship in libraries	0
20584	4071	In my opinion I don't really care if books, movies, or magazines are censored	1
20585	4071	I'm not a person that does much reading but I do know of some books, magazines, and movies that are filled with perfanity	2
20586	4071	In my opinion that is just the authors way of how he or she wanted to do it	3
20587	4071	I believe that libraries should keep these type of materials on the shelves but have them in sections maybe	4
20588	4071	Taking them off the shelves would be disrespectful to the authors/producers	5
20589	4071	That is their work and they took the time to do it for our entertainment	6
20590	4071	Maybe you really dislike all the cursing in books and magazines and want them gone...Well listen, there are heeps and heeps of books out there you can find that are not bad	7
20591	4071	If you are more of the movie type of person but also do not like the cursing or nudity, there are plenty of movies out there that are very innocent	8
20592	4071	I hate when I sit down to watch a movie with the family and then all of sudden the actors start throwing around the @CAPS1 word and half naked women appear	9
20593	4071	But if we would simply read about the movie on the back of the case or ask about it then we would know to choose a different movie	10
20594	4071	One that is more family oriented and safe for children eyes	11
20595	4071	So just because there are some materials that are out there with all sorts of fowl language and indecent human behaviors doesn't mean you should ban them from the libraries	12
20596	4071	If some people want to fill their mind with filth, let them	13
20597	4071	But for you who do not, get other stuff	14
20598	4071	Simply try telling other people about better books they can read and nicer movies to watch	15
20599	4071	Be a role modle and teach them about healthier viewings	16
20600	4072	Censorship in today's libraries is a major issue	0
20601	4072	There are groups who both support and challenge these ideas of censoring books and other media from our children	1
20602	4072	Do you think it is right for someone else to decide what we can or can't read	2
20603	4072	Personally, I believe that we should be able to make our own choices when deciding if a book or movie is too indescent to read or not	3
20604	4072	We as human beings have the ability to make our own decisions	4
20605	4072	Everyday we are faced with hundreds of decisions	5
20606	4072	whether it be what outfit we are going to wear for the day, or what type of food we want to eat	6
20607	4072	In that sense, nobody can tell us that we can't do these things so why should they be allowed to tell us what we can or can't read	7
20608	4072	What @MONTH1 look vulgar to someone, might not look so offensive to another individual	8
20609	4072	Everybody has a different taste in media	9
20610	4072	That is why it is wrong for someone to make decisions on what to watch or read for someone else	10
20611	4072	What they think is wrong @MONTH1 be completely normal to the individual they are making the decison for	11
20612	4072	Censoring of media for kids should be the responsibility of the parents	12
20613	4072	If a parent does not want their child to be exposed to a certain element of media then that parent should not allow their child to see or read it	13
20614	4072	Everybody has their own opinion on things, that is what makes us human individuals	14
20615	4072	The ability to make and process decisons is one of the human races greatest talents	15
20616	4072	These descisions should never be left up to someone sitting in an office in @LOCATION1	16
20617	4072	When the government is making decisions that effect us that personally, do we still truly have freedom	17
20618	4072	When censorship of television comes into question I believe that this is the reason we have ratings	18
20619	4072	Theses ratings warn people of the content included, whether graphic or not	19
20620	4072	With these in place, there is no reason why we should completely remove shows or movies from the public	20
20621	4072	I believe that the same should be done for books	21
20622	4072	Books should be required to have an age appropriate rating on them	22
20623	4072	If you are under the age required to purchase or check-out a book, then you will be rejected and not able to get the book	23
20624	4072	Ratings worked with television and movies, so why can they not work for books to	24
20625	4072	In some cases, some media should be destroyed and hidden from public	25
20626	4072	Media that show racism towards any ethnicity or religion should be banned	26
20627	4072	By doing so, I believe the only effects this will have on society are positive ones	27
20628	4072	Censoring these types or movies, books, ect	28
20629	4072	can save a lot of people hurt or embarrassment	29
20630	4072	I believe that we should be allowed to choose which books, shows, or movies we read or watch	30
20631	4072	This includes all forms of media, excluding any media that provoke racism and hate against a group of people	31
20632	4072	The decisions we make should be influenced by a rating system put in place for all media	32
20633	4072	We as humans have the birth given right of making our own decisions	33
20634	4072	This right should never be taken away from us	34
20635	4073	I do not believe that people should be given the right to do that	0
20636	4073	Just like Katherine Paterson had said, if people did away with everything that offended them, there would not be any books left for any of us	1
20637	4073	Everyone has the choice whether they either want to read the book, or they do not	2
20638	4073	If they do not want to, then they do not have to	3
20639	4073	Just because one person does not like something does not mean that everybody else cannot either	4
20640	4073	Honestly, there are some people who take offense to everything, and if they do not like the book or whatever it @MONTH1 be, they do not have to read it	5
20641	4073	I find a lot of people to say things that offend me, but that does not mean that I have the right to make them stop talking	6
20642	4073	However, I do agree that there should be certain standards set for some of the books out there	7
20643	4073	Some books are too graphic for young children to read, and I think that one should have to be a certain age to be able to read them	8
20644	4073	But, I do not think that just because they are graphic that they should be taken off the shelves	9
20645	4073	Maybe the book gets a very delicate point across, like the book '@CAPS1', for example	10
20646	4073	In this book, a young girl is raped very harshly	11
20647	4073	But, the author did not write the book to tell everyone about her experience	12
20648	4073	She wrote the book to explain that no matter what happens, there is always something that can help	13
20649	4073	This book was a success story, and the graphic detail is there to show the agony the girl had went through	14
20650	4073	Some might find this offensive, but most think that it is uplifting to know that they are not the only ones who have had it happen to them	15
20651	4073	Books are not the only things that might offend some people	16
20652	4073	In certain department stores, there @MONTH1 be a movie that has a line in it that I take offensively	17
20653	4073	Does that give me the right to take it off of the shelf and demand that it be banned	18
20654	4073	No, and why might that be	19
20655	4073	Because I have a choice if I want to watch it or not	20
20656	4073	Another place is the @CAPS2	21
20657	4073	If you ask me, there are a lot more offensive things on the @CAPS2 then there are in books	22
20658	4073	Kids can get on the @CAPS2 and stumble across things that they definitely should not see, so does that mean we should ban the @CAPS2	23
20659	4073	No, because the @CAPS2 helps in a lot of ways too	24
20660	4073	If I wanted to, I could find offense in everything that is in a library	25
20661	4073	Books based on religion, or maybe a website based on a musician that had references to drugs in their lyrics	26
20662	4073	I would be mad if I came to the library to listen to music and someone had removed them from the computer	27
20663	4073	Maybe I do not like what they're listening to, but that does not mean I can do anything about it	28
20664	4073	So, my opinion is that books, or anything else for that matter, should not be banned because someone didn't like what it contained	29
20665	4073	Not everyone is going to like the same book, and that's why there is such a variety to choose from	30
20666	4073	Libraries should not be told which books they can and cannot lend out	31
20667	4073	After all, we are not forced to do anything	32
20668	4073	All of us are different and we like different things, but we should accept the tastes of others as well as our own	33
20669	4074	Books, music, and movies are being taken off of shelves around the globe, because they are found offensive	0
20670	4074	Books, movies, and music were created for a reason	1
20671	4074	It's a form of entertainment as well as to build knowledge	2
20672	4074	Artists, authors and publishers release their work to get information out and to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech	3
20673	4074	Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive	4
20674	4074	Censorship in libraries just hides certain things from society	5
20675	4074	If all books on the @CAPS1 were banned and nobody could read them, nobody would be informed on the horrible event and it could easily be reincated	6
20676	4074	The majority of movies and books have relevant information, portray events that could take, or have taken, place, and teach valuable lessons	7
20677	4074	Artists and authors use their works to get points across to their audiences, whether it is a lesson or learning valubale or interesting information	8
20678	4074	People shouldn't be allowed to just take things off of shelves like they are doing	9
20679	4074	The material we read, music we listen to, and the movies we watch should be our decision to make	10
20680	4074	It shouldn't be decided upon by others wanting to take it off of shelves	11
20681	4074	If someone finds material offensive then they should take their own actions to benifit themselves such as, choosing not to expose themselves or their family to the material	12
20682	4074	Banning things from the public takes away opprotunity for people to engage in things that interest them	13
20683	4074	Some material could be banned for something as simple as one provocative word, sentence or even a thought	14
20684	4074	The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4' had multiple occurances of cursing, but the book told a true story of an event that can happen to anyone	15
20685	4074	It also indirectly included that families can be torn apart if you let them be, but the choice is yours and you can prevent it from happening	16
20686	4074	Small things like such as language should not cause the material to be taken off of shelves where people who appreciate it cannot obtain it	17
20687	4074	Katherine Paterson's quote is correct, if we can just take things off of shelves then there wouldn't be anything left for us	18
20688	4074	Most materials contain something that someone isn't going to agree with, but if we just keep getting rid of things then what is the point in making new material	19
20689	4074	There is always going to be the issue of finding offensive material, but nobody should have the right to ban it from everyone	20
20690	4074	Materials around the globe are being taken off of shelves due to offensive material, but they were created for a reason	21
20691	4074	Not only is it for entertainment,  but it is also for knowledge too	22
20692	4074	Artists, authors, and publishers release their work to get information out to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech.	23
20693	4075	Did your child ever bring home a book	0
20694	4075	A piece of music, movie or magazine	1
20695	4075	Did you ever stop to think that the piece of information that your child was bringing home could be offensive to someone else	2
20696	4075	There are points in time where there isn't an answer to that question and you dont want to chose yes or no	3
20697	4075	The driving question is do you want to remove books, music, movies and magazines from the shelf, just because a parent thinks that its not fit for a child to be reading	4
20698	4075	Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shel	5
20699	4075	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that I work abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	6
20700	4075	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 point in this quotation is that if you take a book off the shelf everytime that someone doesnt think that its right for children to see, then there will be no books left to see	7
20701	4075	In agreement to Katherine, parents @MONTH1 want the best for their children, but there are reasons to why you should agree with the average parent and then there are reasons to why you shouldn't	8
20702	4075	There are books out amongst the world that only adults should see, and their are also books out there that are way too advance to be read by children	9
20703	4075	These books are all made for a reason and have there own purpose on why they are put there	10
20704	4075	Parents have to sit back and think of their children and then think of the rest of the world, its a big world and you cant just take things away from it	11
20705	4075	No matter how much you want to protect a child from the point of seeing the books that are meant for older age ranges, there isnt a way that you can stop it	12
20706	4075	I think that books are there for whatever reason they were written for	13
20707	4075	There is no reason that because one person doesn't agree with the way that someone has written that book, it should be taken off the shelf just for that child	14
20708	4075	Libraries cant just start taking books off the shelf for individual mothers that dont like this or dont like that	15
20709	4075	Many people come from many different areas and see things in a different perspective, they dont know the difference between right and wrong	16
20710	4075	It's a bigger world out there than you and me	17
20711	4075	When one person tries to stand against the world, they're going to get knocked down	18
20712	4075	So why fight when the world was meant to be at peace?	19
20713	4076	I don't think that censoring books and movies is needed in my opinion	0
20714	4076	Very many people are just too protective	1
20715	4076	They just need to calm themselves down and just face the facts	2
20716	4076	Eventually everybody will come in contact with almost everything that is mentioned in books at some point in there life	3
20717	4076	Life is unpredictable and anything can happen at any moment	4
20718	4076	You will probably end up reading the books that you are not supposed to anyway when you get older	5
20719	4076	The people that think there should be censorship on library books will most likely get there way at least in their community	6
20720	4076	I think that libraries should be organized in a way that when you walk in you know the section you want to be in	7
20721	4076	They should have the books for adults in one section, books for teenagers in a different section, and books for kids in another section of the library too	8
20722	4076	This would help the parents that go with their kids keep them in the right spot	9
20723	4076	This would also help in a way to find your book if you know what type of book it is	10
20724	4076	Another good thing that would help in a library are signs that catergorize the books	11
20725	4076	So if you walk in the teenager section and you are looking for a good mystery book	12
20726	4076	You just look at the top of the book case or at the ceiling where the signs are	13
20727	4076	This would help majorly for people that have never been in a library or don't know how to search for their book in a library	14
20728	4076	The next thing would be to have all the movies, magazines, and music in the categories of adult, kids, and teenagers too	15
20729	4076	They would be in the sections of the books but at the same time be seperated to where the signs in the section say movie and music	16
20730	4076	This way kids don't have to roam around to find a certain movie that they want and have to roam around in the adult section to find it	17
20731	4076	The movies and magazines don't have to be exactly in the categories of mystery and things like that because normally movies are more well known than books in our time period	18
20732	4076	A good thing that would keep little kids in the right section would be to color it with a lot of bright colors that will attract their attention	19
20733	4076	If a little kid goes into a section that is dull and boring they @MONTH1 just wander in the adult section and stumble across something that their parents don't want them to	20
20734	4076	The kids section could be lots of colors, the teenager section could be maybe one color, and the adult section could be the most dull of all of the colors	21
20735	4076	All of my ideas would work and keep all of the kids entertained	22
20736	4076	They also will take more of an interest in reading if they are interested by walking in a library	23
20737	4076	These are the only ideas that I have that would work well	24
20738	4076	There could be more things that would keep kids interested but only for a little bit	25
20739	4077	To remove or not to remove     Should people be able to remove books that are offensive	0
20740	4077	I think so;it would help our kids and young adults, to read more educational books, rather than magazines and comics	1
20741	4077	To start off with everyone has their own opinion of what is offensive ,and whats not	2
20742	4077	personally I don't think that we should remove books, because their offensive	3
20743	4077	I think we should just not let that perticular person not put out anymore books	4
20744	4077	But it's like I said everyone has their own opinion	5
20745	4077	Secondly it's entirely up to the library where to place certien books with blood and gore,and if to have them or not	6
20746	4077	personally I like books with blood and gore	7
20747	4077	because it shows how the world auccualy is	8
20748	4077	It'snot like a book where you save the princess or damsel in destress	9
20749	4077	Lastly if parents are conerned about offensive books don't let your kids get those kind of books give them a boring book	10
20750	4077	I mean we know the books that kids are not supposed to read but parents let kids read them	11
20751	4077	In conclusion if you feel that a book is offensive do't pick it up, and don't have it taken off the shelf because there is always someone to disagree with yo	12
20752	4078	I do not believe that censorship in libraries is a good thing	0
20753	4078	For many reasons but to save sometime here are just a few of the reasons why I believe this, there would be no books left for anyone to read, if certain books where taken off the shelf we would not have the knowledge from them, and our kids would not know what other people can think of	1
20754	4078	At the end of this essay one might understand the advandages and disadvantages to censorship in libraries	2
20755	4078	@CAPS6 many books would be gone	3
20756	4078	If we all took off one book that we found offensive then our children and other children would not be able to read	4
20757	4078	Taking off one offensive book per person leaves no books left in a library	5
20758	4078	What one person @MONTH1 find offensive another person could find rather enjoyable	6
20759	4078	Some of my friends think that '@CAPS1' is an offensive novel but I found the book to be rather enjoyable	7
20760	4078	On the other hand we also have to understand that there are somethings that just shouldn't be put out in public	8
20761	4078	@CAPS6 would we get as much knowledge as we have	9
20762	4078	Without all the books that are in our libraries @CAPS6 would people get the knowledge to make great discoveries in science, history, and electronics	10
20763	4078	People would be lost if we didn't have our books	11
20764	4078	The books give people great knowledge and a great place to learn @CAPS6 to do things	12
20765	4078	I myself have learned @CAPS6 to become a successful @CAPS2 novel @CAPS3 from the @CAPS4 I took out of 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4 for @CAPS5.' @CAPS6 would the ideas of other people be heard around the world without books in our libraries	13
20766	4078	Those books that are offensive can also be of great use when doing a research paper or just trying to find something to talk about with friends at school or work	14
20767	4078	Without the books that we have in the library people would not be able to understand what other people thought about certain ideas on politics and other issues in daily life	15
20768	4078	The books help people come up with ideas to create things and be createative in everything they do	16
20769	4078	The ideas that one person expresses in their writing is a great place to find a spark of imagination when a person needs something to keep their mind off of personal issues	17
20770	4078	Life without books	18
20771	4078	Censorship is a good and bad thing in libraries, I myself on one hand do not find it appropraite but on the other hand it can be taken to a whole different perspective	19
20772	4078	People who want to use it don't understand that other people could take the books off the shelf that they, themselves like to read in their spare time, nor do they understand all the knowledge that we gain from books even if they are fiction, and lastly without the books that we have no one would know what someone in a different park of the world was thinking	20
20773	4078	Foremost people who want cenorship in libraries don't understand what would happen if we had the power to all take one book off the shelf	21
20774	4078	One could understand both sides of the coin here but we need to step back and think about what life would be like without our books.	22
20775	4079	There are many books, music, movies, and magezines in the world	0
20776	4079	Some are humorous, historic, or romantic, however some are offensive in some way	1
20777	4079	People @MONTH1 get offended when they read or listen to certain things, but does that mean that those things should be removed from the shelf	2
20778	4079	Some people @MONTH1 find something offensive while another person does not, therefore the music, books, movies, or magazines should not be removed from the shelves	3
20779	4079	If a person thinks that a song should be removed from the shelf and it does get removed, what about the person who did not find it offensive	4
20780	4079	People are intitled to their own thoughts and feelings, however that doesn't mean that one person's feelings are better than someone else's	5
20781	4079	If everyone tried to make everyone happy then there wouldn't be a lot of options to chose from in the library	6
20782	4079	If one person finds something offensive in a book, another person might find another book that is offensive, and it goes on until there aren't any books left	7
20783	4079	With entertainment it is hard to please everyone	8
20784	4079	No matter what it is there will always be at least one person who doesn't like it	9
20785	4079	This, however, does not mean that it should be removed from shelves	10
20786	4079	If one person does find it offensive then there is most likely someone else who doesn't	11
20787	4079	The people who don't find something offensive want to be satisfied, too	12
20788	4079	It is impossible to please everyone, so what should be done	13
20789	4079	If someone finds something offensive, they shouldn't read or listen to it	14
20790	4079	People can chose to quit listening to a song, quit watching a movie, or quit reading a book or magazine that they @MONTH1 find offensive	15
20791	4079	They have the right and freedom to not pay any attention to it	16
20792	4079	This way the person who isn't offened can still enjoy their choices of entertainment at the library	17
20793	4079	If I find something offensive I try not to pay attention to it	18
20794	4079	There are many books or songs that I do find offensive, so I just avoid those	19
20795	4079	By avoiding these books or songs I don't offend anyone else by taking away something that they might enjoy	20
20796	4079	I still am satisfied and so are they	21
20797	4079	The library workers know what they are doing	22
20798	4079	If the library takes away a book because some people find it offensive then they might be offending those people who didn't find it offensive by basically saying that their morals are better than yours	23
20799	4079	A library should take a book or magazine out if it feels necessary, but not to please certain customers becuase then they aren't pleasing the other customers and could offend them	24
20800	4079	People have the right to voice there feelings but that doesn't mean that they are always right and that certain things should be changed because of them	25
20801	4079	It is impossible to make everyone completely satsified but there are compromises	26
20802	4079	The libraries shouldn't remove things off their shelves but should give more options that won't be offensive, and people should avoid the things that they find offensive	27
20803	4080	Libraries have always been an outstanding source for information	0
20804	4080	Among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are book, movies, and magazines	1
20805	4080	Recently, the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir	2
20806	4080	Many parents argue that they don't want their children to be exposed to explicit materials, especially books, exhibited in public libraries	3
20807	4080	Others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves, the shelves would be nearly empty	4
20808	4080	Author Katherine Paterson stated,      ' All of us can think of  book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	5
20809	4080	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Katherine Paterson)	6
20810	4080	Books that are offensive should not be removed from libraries for the simple reason that they are still one of the most reliable sources for information and historical events, and, without books, society would suffer	7
20811	4080	The most important reason as to why people shouldn't be allowed to remove offensive books from shelves is that if every person was allowed to remove a book that he/she found offensive, there wouldn't be many books remaining on the libraries' shelves	8
20812	4080	There are many historical works that contain offensive images and content, but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history	9
20813	4080	Without them, society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today	10
20814	4080	Another  important reason why library censhorship is wrong is that material that one person @MONTH1 find to be offensive @MONTH1 not be ofensive to another	11
20815	4080	Every person has his/her own view on certain matters and events	12
20816	4080	For this reason, the censorship of a certain book shouldn't come down to the opinion of one individual	13
20817	4080	Rather, the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals	14
20818	4080	By doing so, a fair representation of      @CAPS1, most books are meant to tell either fictional stories  or historical events that aren't meant to offend anyone	15
20819	4080	Fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author	16
20820	4080	Also, historical books are meant to capture the events of our past so that people @MONTH1 be able to look back on these events both now and in the future	17
20821	4080	In all, the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal	18
20822	4080	Books were meant to provide historical accounts and fictional stories to enrigh the minds of readers, not poison them with bad content	19
20823	4080	Everyone has their own views, which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material @MONTH1 be to them	20
20824	4081	Do believe that any boook or form of literature should be removed from a library just because someone takes it into offense	0
20825	4081	No, it should not be removed	1
20826	4081	That person should clearly just not read the book or let their children read the book	2
20827	4081	They have a problem with the book, not everyone else if the book was good enough to be published that means someone wants to read the book which means they would make others who want the book upset over their own opinion	3
20828	4081	In the words of Katherine Paterson, a famous author, she says,'All o fus can think of a book that we hope none of uor children or any children have taken off the shelf	4
20829	4081	But i fI have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	5
20830	4081	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 she means by that is everyone has their own opinion on every piece of material that hits stores and libraries	6
20831	4081	If we shall let everyone choose to take these materials off the shelf then we might as well have no books, music, movies, magazines, etc at all because someone somewhere will always not like the material	7
20832	4081	If someone finds something offensive they should simply stay away from it	8
20833	4081	Everyone has their own view of everythings they come across which means if you hate something, your neighbor might love it	9
20834	4081	So simply because the boo or other form of material offend you that doesn't mean that its worth taking off the shelves of libraries and book stores	10
20835	4081	Don't get me wrong I believe in some forms of censorship	11
20836	4081	I just don't believe in people taking their opinion and choosing whether a certain piece of literature or music can be in our libraries	12
20837	4081	I just believe that our libraries are a place where authors can express themselves and share their book, novels, poems, etc	13
20838	4081	I believe that if something is offensive to you that's your opinion and there's an easier way to not hav eyour children read the than getting the book removed, just don't bring the book to your children stay away from the book as much as possible	14
20839	4081	If you @MONTH1 come across it just don't acknowledge it	15
20840	4081	Your children are more at risk of being in a carcrash then reading a nonapropriate book only if you teach them correctly, not to sound harsh but to shine reality on the fact	16
20841	4081	That is why I do not believe in censorship in libraries nor bookstores	17
20842	4082	Dear sir or mam,      Have you or someone in your family ever read a book, magazine, or watched a movie that was taken to be offensive	0
20843	4082	Do you or that person think that it would make a difference if that one book, book or movie was removed from the shelves	1
20844	4082	Would removing every  book, cd, movie or magazine  from shelves that were to have a great or small amount of racism, violence, bad language and other inappropriate things be helping the community	2
20845	4082	Do you believe that its everyone's decision whether or not those things should be removed from the shelves	3
20846	4082	I believe that alot of people in our community have read a book in their lifetime that they considered to be the slightest bit offensive to them	4
20847	4082	I bet people all over the world have read offensive books	5
20848	4082	But the only types of people that those books, movies or magazines would affect would be teenagers and kids	6
20849	4082	But at the time they wouldn't see it as offensive, they would think that it was cool and interesting and they would want to read or watch it over and over again until they were to get bored of it then they would gone back the library and get another one	7
20850	4082	I think in a way it would and would not make a difference whether or not they were removed from the shelves	8
20851	4082	Because if only that one book, movie or magazine was removed from the shelves then the person that got it removed would move on from that book,magazine or movie and find plenty more of them that would be more or equally offensive	9
20852	4082	If every people were to remove every book that they were to find offensive then other people who would enjoy them that certain thing wouldn't beable to obtain it.If everyonewere to find all kinds different books, movies or magazines offensive and got them removed from the shelves then their wouldn't be very much left for the community	10
20853	4082	In conclusion I believe that every individual has their opinion and own way of thinking when it comes to what is and is not offensive	11
20854	4082	I think it is not just up to them on what should be on the shelves in a library, but the communities choice	12
20855	4082	If someone wants a good book,magazine, or movie they should ask suggestions from a friend or family member on what they should get	13
20856	4082	If they can't get any suggestions on what they should get they should just what they think is interesting ignore the offensive parts	14
20857	4083	Have you ever wanted something removed from the shelves of a library because you thought it was offensive	0
20858	4083	If so, how did you go about the situation and what did you want done about it	1
20859	4083	I know in my experiences I have found some things that were offensive, so I am sure that they are out there	2
20860	4083	I think there are so many rules, qualifications, or standards that can give someone reason to take something off a shelf, and those can be different for everyone	3
20861	4083	If you were in a children's library or a school library, I am sure most people would agree that any book with offensive language, situations, opinions, etc	4
20862	4083	should be removed from the shelves	5
20863	4083	Now if you were in a public library in the teenage or adult section and those same books that were inappropriate for the children's library are in the teenage or adult section, that might be admissable	6
20864	4083	The audience is different	7
20865	4083	therefore, the types of literature, music, movies, etc	8
20866	4083	can be more opinionated, mature, and controversial	9
20867	4083	Part of why something should come off of a shelf depends on who is going to be reading it or listening to it	10
20868	4083	In my opinion, there is a fine line as to what can be considered too controversial or too mature	11
20869	4083	@CAPS1 is one reason why I think there should be censorship because some things are definitely too controversial or mature	12
20870	4083	Although, I also think there should be guidelines, and perhaps rules, on what should be allowed on shelves and what should not because some things might be on the edge of the line, but depending on what it is it can be, for example, a learning tool or great read	13
20871	4083	As Katherine Paterson said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @CAPS1 is why I think there should be guidelines or rules	14
20872	4083	If everyone had the right to remove something from a shelf, there might not be anything left to read or listen to	15
20873	4083	Different things are offensive to different people	16
20874	4083	If there were rules or guidelines, that would ensure there would still be things to read and listen to in the future	17
20875	4083	I think there should be censorship in libraries	18
20876	4083	Some pieces of work are just too offensive, and they need to be taken off the shelves	19
20877	4083	I think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created	20
20878	4083	As Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'	21
20879	4084	Today in our day and age we have books, music, movies, and magazines that say or show materials that young children and teens should not be seeing at their ages	0
20880	4084	I am writting your newspaper company to tell you that I think the censorship should be implied more in libraries	1
20881	4084	Their should be something like a warning label on the magazines, movies, music, etc	2
20882	4084	that the parent has to sign before that says, '@CAPS1 child can see or hear the materials being displayed.'      In this centry we have @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 shows showing violience, sexual content, alcohol, and drugs	3
20883	4084	Its almost impossible to keep all children away from these things, but we should at least try to	4
20884	4084	There are shows on @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 now showing teenage pregnencys, and they are pursading the viewers that its okay to have children without being married, or even in a relationship with the person	5
20885	4084	@ORGANIZATION1 shows are now showing things like stealing in stores and the actor or actress getting away with the prize with no conserquence	6
20886	4084	Also they have violence and uneeded langauge	7
20887	4084	I know from @CAPS1 own experience watching @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS1 dad has came into @CAPS1 room, and told me to turn it off	8
20888	4084	That they shouldn't be allowed to do somethings they are showing the viewers	9
20889	4084	I know when I am married and have children I will keep @CAPS1 kids away from certain materials as long as I can until they are old enough to understand, and know the right thing to do in the situation	10
20890	4084	Some of the language they use such as 'retard' I find offensive	11
20891	4084	In @CAPS1 opition the censorship in libraries and in households have really declined	12
20892	4084	Some parents have no idea what their child might be watching behind closed doors	13
20893	4084	A good parent would make sure that the materials their child is watching is appropraite for there age	14
20894	4084	Even books have sexual contact, and language	15
20895	4084	When I have children I will make sure that they are reading materials that fit them	16
20896	4084	Magazines these days are even worse	17
20897	4084	The call the @CAPS7 '@CAPS6 @CAPS7' for a reason, and young teens are picking it up off the shelves at conveniate stores and are reading it	18
20898	4084	Most music you hear on the radio has some sort of offensive words, refuring to sexual activity, or they are singing about drinking or drugs	19
20899	4084	Parents need to get more involved in their childrens life, and what they are reading or seeing	20
20900	4084	I am not saying that all materials need to be removed from the shelves, because some movies or reading materials send off great messages to kids and teens	21
20901	4084	I am just concerned about some things people can get so easily without any censoring	22
20902	4084	I hope you read this essay and really take it into concerderation	23
20903	4084	I hope to hear back from you soon	24
20904	4084	Thank you for your time	25
20905	4085	I believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries if they are offensive	0
20906	4085	Children shouldn't be allowed to read books that have inappropriate pictures on them	1
20907	4085	Censored material can have bad influences on children	2
20908	4085	Scary movies can make children have nightmares	3
20909	4085	There should be restrictions against offensive materials	4
20910	4085	Libraries contain plenty of books, music, movies, and magazines for everyone	5
20911	4085	Libraries also have some offensive items in them	6
20912	4085	Offensive material should be removed from libraries	7
20913	4085	Children don't need to see inappropriate material in libraries	8
20914	4085	Inappropriate material can have bad influences on kids	9
20915	4085	Censored material such as offensive language, smoking, and alchol are extremely bad influences on children	10
20916	4085	Children don't need to say cuss words	11
20917	4085	Smoking can lead to cancer or death	12
20918	4085	Alchol is also addicting and can cause a person to become violent	13
20919	4085	Children shouldn't be able to see these inappropriate items in libraries	14
20920	4085	Scary movies can give children nightmares	15
20921	4085	When I was a child, I saw a scary movie and I couldn't even sleep that night	16
20922	4085	Inappropriate movies need to have ratings so that kids don't watch them	17
20923	4085	Kids believe most of what they watch in movies	18
20924	4085	Movies should be restricted from children to watch them	19
20925	4085	There is a lot of material in libraries that should be censored from children	20
20926	4085	Bad influences can have a bad effect on children	21
20927	4085	I believe libraries need to restrict items that will have a bad influence on children.	22
20928	4086	Parents are responsible for their child, whether it's taking them to school, making sure their grades are up or even watching what their child reads	0
20929	4086	Libraries should not remove 'offensive' books, magazines, movies, etc	1
20930	4086	That is the parents reponsibility, it's the library's	2
20931	4086	The library is a place to go when you want to get a book or a movie or a magazine, ect	3
20932	4086	Whether it's for enjoyment or research	4
20933	4086	That book was specifically placed in the library for someone to read	5
20934	4086	If we took out all the material in the library that some people, in there oppion, found offensive, then there wouldn't be very many books left in the library	6
20935	4086	Who is to choose if the books were offensive anyhow	7
20936	4086	If an adult or mature teenager went to the library to look for a book and it wasn't there because they took it off the shelves because parents couldn't watch their child pick out a book	8
20937	4086	Or even teach them that those books are wrong	9
20938	4086	The parents have full responsibiliy if their child is reading something that is inapropriate in their eyes	10
20939	4086	How would the library know which books to take off the shelf because all parents have different ideas of what is right and wrong	11
20940	4086	If the kid is young, the parent would be the one taking their child to the library, so they could easily watch which book, magazine, or movie they're picking out	12
20941	4086	Most libraries have a children's section anyway	13
20942	4086	It is not the library's responisbility to watch out for your child, it's the parents	14
20943	4086	Their job is to supply the community with books, movies, magazines, etc	15
20944	4086	Libraries should keep the books on the shelvles so people from all over can enjoy any book they would like to read.	16
20945	4087	Some people do not like the fact that there are books on the shelf that they consider offensive	0
20946	4087	People argue to get the corruptive  books, magazines, movies off the shelves	1
20947	4087	The customers have the choice not to check out the material, it's not their place to try to get the object removed from the shelf	2
20948	4087	People that go to the library have the choice to read the book or not, if they have heard bad reviews about the book then they can just ignore it	3
20949	4087	The books on the shelves in public libraries are there for a reason, and its not to be taken off just because some people dont care for it	4
20950	4087	Reasons might be that the book goes against beliefs of religion, or just the way those people view things, but that still does not give them the right to remove the book from the shelf	5
20951	4087	Everybody has different likeings and tastes when it comes to books	6
20952	4087	Because a book is not up to one person's standards does not mean that it is not up to another person's	7
20953	4087	Beliefs and standards differ from person to person and that is why the likeing of books is different to most everybody	8
20954	4087	Most people are worried about their children reading the books that they find offensive	9
20955	4087	If your child is looking for books to read and they pick out one of the books you dont want them reading then tell them that the book is innapropriate	10
20956	4087	The kid will most likely listen to you and put the book back, that is a much better technique than trying to get the book removed	11
20957	4087	Removing a book from the shelf is completely unfair to the other people who visit the library	12
20958	4087	Everybody should have the right to read what they want and have the choice to ignore the books that they choose not to read	13
20959	4087	When looking for a book, magazine, movie, etc., and you run across one you find innapropriate then ignore it and continue with your day, it's as simple as that	14
20960	4088	It was during @CAPS1 class that we visited the library to look at various books	0
20961	4088	One of which, that my teacher picked up, was '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Right @CAPS5' by @PERSON2	1
20962	4088	The book had been written during the cult of domesticity and was filled with ideas of the submissiveness of women and their devotion to the home	2
20963	4088	I found that book to be very offensive just because I was looking at it from a modern perspective	3
20964	4088	Nowadays it would be considered sexist to assume that women should stay home and take care of the house while men work outside of the home	4
20965	4088	Just because it was a piece of literature that I didn't agree with, doesn't mean that it's not a valued work	5
20966	4088	Certain materials should not be removed from the libraries if found offensive	6
20967	4088	There is such a wide variety of people who search through the library, so finding a certain piece of material that not one person finds offensive is nearly impossible	7
20968	4088	Materials shouldn't be allowed to be censored for that reason	8
20969	4088	Materials found in the library are a form of expression to the individual who created them or to the society as a whole	9
20970	4088	Censoring those works would be considered a violation to the freedom of expression	10
20971	4088	People of all ages look through the library to find books or music or magazines	11
20972	4088	Each of those people has a different belief	12
20973	4088	What is considered a work of art to one person could be seen as highly offensive to another	13
20974	4088	If  libraries were to start censoring their books, then the result would be a small selection of drab, emotionless materials	14
20975	4088	People visit the library to find materials that they are interested in, or look around to expand their interests	15
20976	4088	Libraries need to contain a wide variety of material to satisfy this knowledge.A library's job is to educate the people who enter it	16
20977	4088	A good form of education is the exposure to different types of material	17
20978	4088	Sometimes the offending nature of a novel is what makes it good	18
20979	4088	It gets the reader thinking about what the author's purpose was	19
20980	4088	'The @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON3 was seen as a very offensive work for a long period of time	20
20981	4088	It incorporated the issue of slavery when many people weren't ready to deal with it	21
20982	4088	As a result, that book was banned from libraries and schools	22
20983	4088	Now, it is seen as one of the most famous works in @CAPS7 literature	23
20984	4088	That example proves that material that's reguarded as offensive, shouldn't automatically have its value lowered	24
20985	4088	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' as said by Katherine Paterson, is an accurate depiction of the outcome of a library with censorship on its materials	25
20986	4088	Part of what make a good work great, is its ability to stir up controversy among its readers	26
20987	4088	Removing the controversy will remove an aspect of education along with it, which is essentially the main purpose of a library	27
20988	4089	I think @CAPS4's ok to have books even if they are found offensive, because to some people those books aren't found offensive	0
20989	4089	People shouldn't let what is in books bother them	1
20990	4089	The way I see @CAPS4 is, if the book offends you, then don't read @CAPS4	2
20991	4089	There is no reason to throw a big tantrum over a book, that to some people isn't offensive	3
20992	4089	I agree that books that are offensive are bad, but then again that's why you have the choice to @CAPS1 not open @CAPS4	4
20993	4089	@CAPS4 would be easier to find certain things if we @CAPS1 had a library for everything	5
20994	4089	Like for instance, music	6
20995	4089	if we had a library for @CAPS1 music, @CAPS4 would be easier to narrow down things and find exactly what you are looking for	7
20996	4089	Same thing with movies and magazines	8
20997	4089	The only problem with this solution is the economic expenses	9
20998	4089	Back to the point	10
20999	4089	I've never ran across an offensive book, and if I did, I would @CAPS1 simply put @CAPS4 back	11
21000	4089	Why take a good book to many people off the shelf @CAPS1 because one person might think @CAPS4's offensive	12
21001	4089	Most libraries have labels for certain books anyway	13
21002	4089	If you know what kind of book your looking for then @CAPS4 shouldn't be offensive	14
21003	4089	Books are a good thing and aren't meant to be bad	15
21004	4089	Books are for entertainment and fun, and they shouldn't be found offensive	16
21005	4089	I've said @CAPS4 before, and I'll say @CAPS4 again	17
21006	4089	If you find a book offensive @CAPS1 put @CAPS4 back on the shelf and leave @CAPS4 be	18
21007	4089	Music on the other hand, is offensive to many people	19
21008	4089	I mean, let's face @CAPS4, we all have a type of music we love and a type of music we hate	20
21009	4089	They're are a lot of offensive songs in the world, which I personally think shouldn't be around at all, and putting @CAPS4 in libraries is even worse	21
21010	4089	Music is a persuasive thing, and if a kid walks into a library and picks up an appealing @CAPS2, @CAPS4 could be bad	22
21011	4089	That @CAPS2 could have everything about doing drugs on @CAPS4, which persuades kids to do them, and no one wants their kids doing drugs	23
21012	4089	I say that if you find anything offensive that should be taken out of libraries, @CAPS4's music, not books	24
21013	4089	I've pretty much said all that has been needed to have been said	25
21014	4089	books are books, they're offensive to some people, and to some people, they're not	26
21015	4089	In the end, @CAPS4's all a matter of opinion	27
21016	4090	I believe that if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offends you	0
21017	4090	People shouldn't be able to disarm that material off of the shelf	1
21018	4090	If it's there children they're worried about just teach them from staying away from adult section	2
21019	4090	Also, some people don't like foul language but thats there opinion	3
21020	4090	Than we wouldn't have any material left in the library if everyone had the rights to disarm offensive material	4
21021	4090	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any us' (Paterson)	5
21022	4090	If it's your children your worried about seeing censorship in libraries but, you don't mind it just have them stay in the kids section reading books	6
21023	4090	You could just go a day where you want to go by yourself so you don't have to worry about your kids spotting any censorship	7
21024	4090	Before checking the material out skim through it make sure there is nothing offensive for your child	8
21025	4090	Many people don't like foul language but, that's there opinion	9
21026	4090	It doesn't bother me because it gives the book a little taste and it's more interesting	10
21027	4090	Helps you understand what the reader is feeling upon someone or thing	11
21028	4090	Sometimes it helps show what mood the reader has in the story	12
21029	4090	Finally, if everyone had the right to disarm all the offensive materials, we wouldn't have anything left	13
21030	4090	This could effect peoples education and reading skills	14
21031	4090	Some of that material is peoples hobbies they wouldn't be able to do what they like anymore	15
21032	4090	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off of the shelf '(Paterson)	16
21033	4090	It's an easy fix just teach your children from right and wrong	17
21034	4090	Would you rather have your children have a good education or not know how to read	18
21035	4090	Many people dislike foul language but it could make the book better	19
21036	4090	I don't know what I would do if there was no more books	20
21037	4090	Well these are examples of why people shouldn't have the rights to disarm material off of the shelf if it offends them	21
21038	4090	What would you do if you had something you loved taken away from you?	22
21039	4091	Removing certain books,music,movies,magazines,and so on is a serious question to ask.Well,some believe its a good idea,on the other hand other people dont	0
21040	4091	If you ask my opinion I would have to side with not removing certain books,movies,music,etc	1
21041	4091	One of the many reasons why I believe we should not remove them is because everyone is entitled their own opinion.Some @MONTH1 find a book offensive,well on the other hand some @MONTH1 find it riviting and not offensive at all	2
21042	4091	If the person thinks the book is offensive they should simpily not read it.They should not have to band books,music,movies,etc	3
21043	4091	just because some find it offensive .Well others @MONTH1 find things offensive that the other person does not .We all have are own beliefes and we should be free to express them,as long as it doesnt involve breaking any laws	4
21044	4091	Another reason why I agree with not removing certain books,movies,and so on is because we might not have any left.Like i said before we all have our own opinions.Not every single person is going to say a book,etc	5
21045	4091	doesnt offend them.We should not have to take away certain items.But on the other hand i believe we should restrict certain books,moves,music,etc	6
21046	4091	If a book,movie,etc.,seems to complicated for a child to comprehend,then they should not be able to read,watch,etc.,the item.We should classify things based on knowledge,understanding,and maturity	7
21047	4091	Also I believe we all have a right to believe what we want to believe	8
21048	4091	Just as we all have choices.I can agree with some of the arguments other people have for removing certain books,and movies,etc.,but the main idea is to do what is best for everyone.I just dont see that removing every book,movie,music,etc.,will solve any problems .In fact I truly believe it would make matters worse.Their would be arguments of what to remove and what not to	9
21049	4091	In conclusion I belive we should keep libraires the way they are.It would keep things less complicated	10
21050	4091	Also it would be the best choice	11
21051	4091	i\	12
21052	4092	A @CAPS1 @CAPS2     @CAPS3 there ever a time where there @CAPS3 a movie that you wanted to see, but due to graphics in the movie you were not aloud to see it	0
21053	4092	Many parents or young adults believe that movies being @CAPS1 are a good thing	1
21054	4092	What they do not know is that if something is @CAPS1 that's just going to make the kid want to go see it more	2
21055	4092	Frist of all, if they kids want to see it badly enough they will just sneek in or get a copy of it off the internet, which is illegal	3
21056	4092	I remember when I @CAPS3 younger me and my friends always wanted to go see @CAPS4 rated movies	4
21057	4092	So we would have our parents drop us off	5
21058	4092	When we would arrive home are parents would ask what we saw, we would lie and say we saw the new @CAPS5 @CAPS6 movie	6
21059	4092	Therefore kids will get into trouble for a stupid thing	7
21060	4092	Secondly if you don't believe your child should watch a movie because of your religous beliefs, then you and your child should have a talk	8
21061	4092	Statistics show that the more the kids can talk to their parents openly and come to an agreement, the less the child is going to lie and go behide their parents back	9
21062	4092	Many parents come to an agreement, that if they get to preview the movie frist then they will decide if it is approprite for their child to watch	10
21063	4092	In many cases this works out great for the parents and children, fore if the adult gives premission for the child to go see it then the parent and child will have something to talk about when they get home	11
21064	4092	Finally, I believe movies should be uncensored	12
21065	4092	For the movies are not really that bad, your child will end up seeing it one way or another	13
21066	4092	Whether it's at a friends house the internet, or going to the theater	14
21067	4092	What harm could it cause to see it now	15
21068	4092	So in conclusion to my statements.To know that your child will see this movie, wouldn't it be okay not to censore it	16
21069	4092	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	17
21070	4092	and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' as said by Katherine Paterson is true	18
21071	4092	Could you imagine living in a @CAPS1 wold	19
21072	4092	I know I can't	20
21073	4092	So think are you for or against censorship	21
21074	4092	Would you want your kid to lie to you about where they were going or what they saw	22
21075	4092	I know I wouldn't	23
21076	4093	There are all kinds of different people in the world	0
21077	4093	People with different views on things, people with strong opinions, people who are very outspoken and mature and alot of those people are authors of the hundreds of books that fill our libraries at school	1
21078	4093	Some schools censor certain books from schools because they think the tone or message is inappropriate or too violent, but I believe that we have a right to these books	2
21079	4093	In my opinion no book should be censored from the library	3
21080	4093	We have troops fighting for our freedom of press and freedom of speech and censoring books completely ignores these wonderful freedoms our country has given us	4
21081	4093	During my freshman year we read a book called '@CAPS1 @NUM1' and before we read it our teacher told us a little bit about what it is about	5
21082	4093	She said the book was about the way a society had banned books like they were drugs or something that could hurt us	6
21083	4093	Now apparently a school didn't like the idea of a society banning all books so they banned this book from being read to their children	7
21084	4093	Now if you actually read this book they portray how bizzare and crazy this would be to have all books banned but here we are banning a book about banned books	8
21085	4093	Does this make any sense	9
21086	4093	To be honest by the time you are in high school you have probably seen, heard, and done crazier stuff than what people put in the 'banned books'	10
21087	4093	Now I know there are some people who would say just because you do things that you should not be doing in the first place does not mean you @CAPS2 to read about it all the time and fill your head with ideas about it, and I agree on some level because most of the stuff high schoolers do they shouldn't, but thats life, plain and simple	11
21088	4093	In my opinion, high schoolers really are mature enough to handel some offensive language or violent scenes because I'm sure they see worse stuff on the televison or sometimes in their own homes	12
21089	4093	One of my good friends is @NUM2 years old, has two jobs, her own apartment with her boyfriend, and is not supported by either of her parents	13
21090	4093	Now this girl still goes to high school and has great grades and is obviously very mature for her age but yet even she is not allowed to read a book with some offensive language in it	14
21091	4093	I think our society 'babies' us a little to much because when we get out into the real world things are not going to be censored or kept quiet	15
21092	4093	I think high schools @CAPS2 to put these books into the libraries because it might help some kids grow up and become more mature	16
21093	4093	When we go into the work place after college and start our lives with careers, homes, and families we @MONTH1 be to immature to deal with it and I know some people who are	17
21094	4093	Censored books are just a way to keep the way we live life quiet to some people and never let kids grow up and experience things	18
21095	4093	We have a right to these books just like the people who write them have a right to do so	19
21096	4093	If they can publish them, then we should be able to read them no matter what our age is	20
21097	4094	Inappropriate magazines in the reach of children?!	0
21098	4094	'@CAPS1 just not right', says reporter @PERSON1, 'I think that magazines, books, and other profanities should be out of the reach of children and only discussed when chosen by an adult'	1
21099	4094	Libraries in the present day need to overseer children when they are looking in the library	2
21100	4094	If children see something that they want with no guardian then they shouldn't get it, its just that simple	3
21101	4094	Although the books can seem inappropriate to some people they should not be taken off the shelves because older books help children learn about what happened in the earlier days, it teaches them some of the ways that we use now, and it shows real stories about people in modern day	4
21102	4094	For example some of the books about @ORGANIZATION1 connect some people as being to abrassive and mocking, but it just shows what happened long before there were laws for racism	5
21103	4094	The books about @NUM1 also come provacative to some people because they lost someone close during the bombing, the books teach the kids that not everyone is nice and cruel things happen to some good people.Books about peoples life are also in libraries talking about what happened to them as they were kids or how their parents died of cancer, the books teach the children that outcomes can turn out for the good or the bad	6
21104	4094	Some entertainment is not intended for kids to see, for example, pornography and provacative language	7
21105	4094	Pornography is thought to be an entertainment for adults, but many times it is just something that can scare kids at young ages if they do not know what is really happening	8
21106	4094	Also, provacative language in a book or on a cd is not something that kids should be listening to	9
21107	4094	However, they need to learn that if they hear those words they need to know not to say them so they don't get into trouble by their parents	10
21108	4094	Books of history are thought to be helpful when children are growing up	11
21109	4094	Most of the time that is correct, about @PERCENT1 of the children take in the information and use it to help them	12
21110	4094	However, there is @PERCENT2 of children out there that will just think of the information that they are being told as good things	13
21111	4094	@ORGANIZATION2 didn't just wake up one day and say im going to bomb the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4	14
21112	4094	His devious plans and clever mastermining took alot of time to plan out	15
21113	4094	People @MONTH1 object to children learning some things about history, but i think it is needed for every child to understand	16
21114	4094	Everyone needs to know about the ups and downs about their country and the others surrounding them	17
21115	4094	Children @MONTH1 not understand right now what is wrong with the economy, but they will soon learn when they are adults why people complain so much	18
21116	4094	Books about this stuff @MONTH1 come offensive to some people, but down the road books are used for many things, we still learn about people from hundreds of years ago	19
21117	4094	Children will soon learn of the harsh conditions and the reason why things happen	20
21118	4094	Without the books and the videos the future will never know what happened	21
21119	4094	Many young people @MONTH1 change words in books, but the books will always still have what really happened	22
21120	4094	@CAPS1 why i think that the libraries should keep the books on the shelves, just out of reach of the children	23
21121	4095	Reading is very important for kids these days	0
21122	4095	Libraries should have the right to have any kind of text, movie, magazine, or genre of music that is desired for a student to learn from	1
21123	4095	There are not any kind of books that could be deemed offensive in any way to people these days	2
21124	4095	There are exceptions to this however like any book written to specifically target a race, religion, or gender	3
21125	4095	Such as books written by raving racist fanatics like members of the @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS1-@CAPS2's	4
21126	4095	Being a high school student and having a nice library in my school I have learned a lot from the books in my library	5
21127	4095	I have never in my @CAPS6 years of @CAPS4 seen a book or heard of someone who saw a book that offended them	6
21128	4095	I can assure you that there is not one book in the @CAPS7 that would offend me personally, this is not to say though that there are books out there that will offend certain people	7
21129	4095	Reading books is fun to me and I would not want to miss out on a good book because a library is not holding it because there is the off chance that someone somewhere might get offended by that certain book	8
21130	4095	Reading should not be limitted based on content because there is always someone out there who is looking for that certain book for a good read	9
21131	4095	I have heard of people who have gotten mad because there was a nude picture in an art book	10
21132	4095	Seriously	11
21133	4095	An art book	12
21134	4095	Art is what it is	13
21135	4095	Art has had naked people in it for thousands of years	14
21136	4095	Why should it start to offend people now when it didnt offend people then	15
21137	4095	People are just weird in this day in age i guess	16
21138	4095	There are certain movies that should most definately be removed from the shelves of libraries, such as porn for example	17
21139	4095	Porn should never, under no cercumstances be held in a library	18
21140	4095	There are special places for porn such as the internet	19
21141	4095	Music is a different story however	20
21142	4095	Music should not be taken out of libraries because there are some people who cannot affort to buy music for places like @LOCATION1, iTunes or @CAPS3	21
21143	4095	Music has so many genres that its is impossible to make out what should and shouldnt be in the library, and there are so many different types of people that listen to different types of music in the @CAPS7 and it would be wrong to tell that certain group of people that their music is too heavy or too rappy for the library	22
21144	4095	Listening to the music in the library is a different story however, you should definatly not be allowed to listen to your music in the library or at least not be allowed to have it loud enough for everyone else to hear it	23
21145	4095	I dont read magazines but i know enough about them to know that they should and shouldnt be allowed into a library	24
21146	4095	Magazines like '@CAPS4' and '@ORGANIZATION1' should definatly be allowed into a library because they are the hub of learning from magazines	25
21147	4095	However there are magazines that should not be allowed into a library like '@CAPS5' and other pornographic magazines as well as ones like '@CAPS6' which are magazines that target young girls to make them think that they should look perfect like the models in the pictures	26
21148	4095	Those are the types of magazines that make young girls dress skimpy and inapproprietly and make girls turn to throwing up to keep themselves skinny	27
21149	4095	There are definatly some things that should be kept out of the libraries but one book, or one movie, or one genre of music, or one kind of magazine should not keep them all out	28
21150	4095	One problem shouldnt make them all a problem	29
21151	4095	Libraries are a place where people go to escape, similar to things like @CAPS7 of @CAPS8 and other videogames	30
21152	4095	People should have the right to go to a labrary with the intent of getting something and they should be able to get what they came for.	31
21153	4096	What is @CAPS1, @CAPS1 is whay made this country the who we are today	0
21154	4096	There are manny ways people can exspress them self in todays world, and it just so happens the art of writing acting and art are a huge part to the way people exspress them self	1
21155	4096	Because all of us are different and have our different veiws on the subjuct	2
21156	4096	Im not going to preach to you about what is right and what is wrong	3
21157	4096	im just going to share a few prior exspereances	4
21158	4096	Now all of theas were from being in a libraries	5
21159	4096	Some of them in smaller towns, others in the hart of a larger city	6
21160	4096	There is evean a story of a man and wife, in the suburbs of a larger city	7
21161	4096	It is also amazing to see what is exsepted in differeant parts of our country	8
21162	4096	Well it all started when I was sitting at a small table in the back of the @LOCATION1 librarie	9
21163	4096	It was a small groupe of friends and we were all working on our reaserch papers	10
21164	4096	But we then saw a man and a woman, what I proseaved as husband and wife	11
21165	4096	They were looking at the magazines on the shelf directly infront of us	12
21166	4096	As he picked up a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazin she looked over to him and proclamed, that is so derogitory against woman	13
21167	4096	So he put it down and walked out	14
21168	4096	Wandering what was so bad about this magazin I walked over to the rack to see a woman standing in her underware with a classic car	15
21169	4096	About a mounth later I was walking in my local librare droping off some books for my mom	16
21170	4096	Instantly when opening the door I hear to people having a heated conversation about the painting they had hanging on the back wall, in the adult section	17
21171	4096	Wich was of a woman with her chest exsposed, now mind you this was not a modern painting it was rather old, with the paint slowly  pealing off	18
21172	4096	Now that painting was there for manny years with out any one saying any thing and that was the argument made by the head librarean	19
21173	4096	There were manny people standing in the area that this was taking place, and manny of them were not evean willing to hear what the woman had to say, because the painting turned out to be very famous and has been there since before some of the middle aged people in there could reamber	20
21174	4096	As you can see there are manny differant veiws on what is exsepted in the modern time	21
21175	4096	Advertizement is all over and manny magazines use peoples bodys to draw people to their add, so they can try to sell their product	22
21176	4096	I belive there should be a line drawn when it comes to that kind of addvertzing	23
21177	4096	They @MONTH1 have to come to a agreement that each magazine should say if it contains the kind of adult content like that	24
21178	4096	if they were to make this a law they should have to put it right in the front cover so you know if you pic that magazine up, you are at risk of seeing things like that	25
21179	4096	altho when it comes to a painting of times before the @DATE1 and people had grown up in that same area for years and have been seeing this painting since they were yong too, I do not think that painting should have been taken off the wall	26
21180	4096	There is a fine line when it comes to the information being exseptible or not that is why I do belive there should be some kind of rating system whith the book and etc	27
21181	4098	I am writing this essay to puersuade the members of our local library to use better censorship when putting unfit material on the shelves for the members of our community to use	0
21182	4098	In this essay I will reflect my views of this subject, backed by true facts that I have learned from many passed experiences	1
21183	4098	I believe that there is a large amount of reading material on the children section selves of our libraries that is far to advanced for many young children to understand	2
21184	4098	I myself have reviewed many of the books in the childrens section of many libraries	3
21185	4098	When doing so I noticed that many of the material makeing up this section is far to advanced or is to profound for children to absorb	4
21186	4098	Young children need to be reading more books of fantasy to allow them to use their imagiation more and not let their head be filled with thoughts of war and disaster	5
21187	4098	The children that read today need to have more material offered to them that they understand and not so much material that they can't comprehend	6
21188	4098	Lets use put more fit books on the selves of our library and quit wasteing our money on unfit books	7
21189	4098	In reaching the conclusion of this article I hope that I have persueaded  the readers to understand the point I am trying to make	8
21190	4098	I hope my readers take the information I have givin and put it to work	9
21191	4099	Libraries are community centers	0
21192	4099	Children and adults go to libraries to check out new books that could give them new experiences and information	1
21193	4099	If libraries took out books because they were inappropriate or offensive, then young adults and adults would never recieve those new experiences	2
21194	4099	Libraries require all sorts of books to make it a qualified library	3
21195	4099	If libraries censor their books, then other materials might start vanishing as well	4
21196	4099	Most young adults read about books that are about adventure, mystery, or love	5
21197	4099	A person could find a mystery book with a serial killer for a main character offensive, but you can't rewrite the book for one person	6
21198	4099	futhermore, take that book completely off the shelf	7
21199	4099	That book is public property	8
21200	4099	If the library took that mystery book off the shelf, then the library is taking away the experience of another young adult reading it	9
21201	4099	One teenager's thoughts do not account for other teenagers' thoughts	10
21202	4099	Libraries that take away offensive or inappropriate books might influence other multi-billion dollar industries to second guess their work	11
21203	4099	The movie industry, for example	12
21204	4099	The movie industry might second guess the directors or actors/actresses they are hiring	13
21205	4099	Actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children	14
21206	4099	Imagine if a child's favorite actor disappeared from future movies	15
21207	4099	that child would be left without a role model	16
21208	4099	The affects of censoring books and magazines go way beyond the libraries	17
21209	4099	Music artist might also be affected	18
21210	4099	Rappers curse and swear in their music because it is how they voice their opinions and personal experiences	19
21211	4099	For example, @ORGANIZATION1, a famous rapper	20
21212	4099	He curses in his music because it's how he shows his emotion in an event	21
21213	4099	If music publishers wouldn't publish him because his work is offensive, then he would lose his job and career	22
21214	4099	This is how people in today's society make their living	23
21215	4099	by providing entertainment to other people	24
21216	4099	Libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults	25
21217	4099	Authors know what they are writing	26
21218	4099	They write it because it shows emotions and feelings	27
21219	4099	It is the same thing with music artists and screen-play writers	28
21220	4099	If movies were all about unicorns the movie industry would fall apart quickly	29
21221	4099	Libraries, as a whole, need to think about the bigger picture before they extinguish books, experiences, thoughts, and hard work	30
21222	4100	Raded @CAPS1 for @CAPS2, violance and some nudety	0
21223	4100	This kind of movie shouldnt be on any kind of shelf	1
21224	4100	Its to inapprope for kids, see or even read what the movie case says	2
21225	4100	There shouldnt be any kind of movie or magazine with nude pictures	3
21226	4100	Its bad for the kids to see or here because one day a little boy/girl is going to do something that they see in a movie or a magazine and get in trouble	4
21227	4100	Its just wrong to see other people naked if u ask me	5
21228	4100	The only person i want to see that way is my wife in ten or so years	6
21229	4100	But i dont want to watch a movie and see a lady nude	7
21230	4100	The nest thing is violance	8
21231	4100	Man i just wish guns wernt invented or bombs	9
21232	4100	Because I have lost alot of friends to guns	10
21233	4100	I lost about six cousins in the war from where a bomb hit there area	11
21234	4100	More and more people and going out and buying guns and bombs because, of movies and what people say in books and in magazines	12
21235	4100	People are getting name of guns and what they look like from movies and magazines and getting them and getting bombs off the black market	13
21236	4100	People get these ideas because of movies	14
21237	4100	Last but not least @CAPS2 it the main thing kids get in trouble for in schools	15
21238	4100	They leard it from movies mainly because the actor say the words	16
21239	4100	Now the kids know how to say them	17
21240	4100	Sitcs say that kids say and do what there favorite actor says and dose on and off the air	18
21241	4100	My conclusion says that all every thing with violance should be taken off the shelfs	19
21242	4101	Throughout history there have been many books written at a time in history when their beliefs on certain things differed from what our world today believes	0
21243	4101	Things that have changed as our world has changed are the views on slavery, womens rights, religion, and many other things	1
21244	4101	These views are based on what most people of a time frame believed	2
21245	4101	I feel that just because something someone wrote or said offends someone, does not give people the right to ban that book or quote from society as a whole	3
21246	4101	They have the right to ban it from themselves, but it is up to each individual whether or not it is banned for everyone	4
21247	4101	Our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech	5
21248	4101	This shows that even though someone @MONTH1 write or speak out against the majority opinion, they can say whatever they want without being punished for it	6
21249	4101	This means that people can not just ban something for what it might say or portray	7
21250	4101	In my life explicit music seems to be something that some people are trying to ban	8
21251	4101	My parents believe that I am at the right age that I should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music I want to	9
21252	4101	I feel that public libraries can set age restrictions on items based off language, nudity, and other inappropriate things for children just as movie theaters do, but they do not have the right to ban books	10
21253	4101	Even though there is an age restriction, as long as the guardian of the child direct says it is fine if his/her child @MONTH1 check out the book or the parent checks out the book for the child, then it is fine that that child gets that book	11
21254	4101	The choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents	12
21255	4101	If libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive, then a library would have very few to no books	13
21256	4101	In almost all of books someone @MONTH1 be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else	14
21257	4101	These books that offend people should be kept on the shelf so that people can understand how society's views on things were back in the time period that the book was written	15
21258	4101	These items in libraries that are found offensive shows us what was wrong with society at that time and helps us learn from past mistakes in history and how to avoid them	16
21259	4101	For example, in the play A @ORGANIZATION1 it shows how the society's view of women was	17
21260	4101	It showed that they did not think highly of women and how there purpose in life were to raise the children and that was it	18
21261	4101	They did not feel that they had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that	19
21262	4101	This indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today	20
21263	4101	If libraries start to ban books, music, movies, magazines or other items then they are hiding things they do not want people to read	21
21264	4101	Libraries should not be able to ban something because it is offensive, but they have the right to put age restrictions on certain things	22
21265	4101	Authors and artists have freedom of speech to say whatever they want and libraries can not take that away from them	23
21266	4102	I believe that the children of today should be able to read, and learn the same things that our parents have learned in the past	0
21267	4102	Learning things through the same teachings, books, movies..	1
21268	4102	etc	2
21269	4102	Learning things this way would be better then taking out cussing, swaring and certain detailed writing, because if you took all that away its like lieing about history, and what really happend	3
21270	4102	Should the children of today be deprived of the truth	4
21271	4102	Would you want your children going to school everyday and learning things from a text book that were twisted around just so that it was apropriate and non offencive	5
21272	4102	Think about it..	6
21273	4102	Were you deprived of learning history when you were in school	7
21274	4102	I didn't think so, so why start now	8
21275	4102	Say your child is going to be reading '@ORGANIZATION1' in @CAPS1 class today	9
21276	4102	Would you want to ruin a classic book by taking the '@CAPS2' word and the word 'slave' out of the book	10
21277	4102	Depriving them of how there use to be slave owners, slaves, and racial comments	11
21278	4102	Depriving them of actual history	12
21279	4102	Would you also deprive them from learning about wars, revolutions, and mass killings just to make learning apropriate	13
21280	4102	No	14
21281	4102	I wouldn't	15
21282	4102	I would want my children learning anything and everything about world history	16
21283	4102	I do not think that there should be censorship in libraries	17
21284	4103	Libraries contain many helpful and entertaining materials for people of all ages	0
21285	4103	Some @MONTH1 argue that a library holds documents that are offensive and should not be put on the shelf, but I beg to differ	1
21286	4103	A library holds many books, magazines, movies, etc	2
21287	4103	that can advance the knowledge of citizens	3
21288	4103	Libraries can, and probably do, contain materials that are guilty of being offensive, but they shouldn't be taken off the shelf because of this	4
21289	4103	Instead, libraries should be divided into sections based on topics	5
21290	4103	If a parent doesn't want their child to read a book based on racism, then the parent simply keeps the child out of that section	6
21291	4103	How will children learn about what goes on in @LOCATION1 if they are not shown	7
21292	4103	Children won't know how to cope with the harsh realities of the world unless they are exposed to them early	8
21293	4103	This doesn't mean that a child should be shown a magazine highlighting @PERSON2's next drug scandal, but showing them that stuff like this does go on and you should not live that way	9
21294	4103	Libraries don't contain material that is offensive without a reason	10
21295	4103	What if a high school student is doing a report on the rise of teen-pregnancy	11
21296	4103	This student should have no better source for information than a library	12
21297	4103	The library would be the most trustworthy documentation of facts about this topic	13
21298	4103	These books that a library holds are not only there to educate us, but to entertain us as well	14
21299	4103	If a library removes a biography on the rapper, @ORGANIZATION1, because he has a 'rocky past', they @MONTH1 lose one client who came to the library to be amazed by the struggles that many successful people have overcome to get where they are today	15
21300	4103	As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' If a library censors all of the material that goes throught the system, there @MONTH1 not be any books left to entertain ourselves	16
21301	4103	Therefore, libraries should not monitor what material is put on the shelf.	17
21302	4104	There are thousands of books in libraries now a days, some are from @NUM1 years ago	0
21303	4104	Books are books, and anyone at any age should be able to remove any type of book off of a shelf	1
21304	4104	Books, music, movies and magazines are all mad to interest people and what they enjoy reading	2
21305	4104	Authors and publishers should not be pentalized for their hard work they achieved	3
21306	4104	There are many people in the world, who like all different types of books	4
21307	4104	But just because a book has censorship inside the story doesn't mean any human being will enjoy the story	5
21308	4104	I enjoy reading stories about romance, and I'm sure there is censorship inside a romance story	6
21309	4104	I only prefer romance stories, and if every single romance story had censorship and libraries removed the books from the shelves, I wouldn't read any type of book	7
21310	4104	Because I only enjoy reading about the romance	8
21311	4104	I only find adults and young adults reading romance stories, and these people have the matureness not to act out about censorship	9
21312	4104	It's not best to ruin the stories for adults and young adults who like to read about the censorship inside of stories	10
21313	4104	There many be people who find it so interesting, that if it's based on a true story then they would want to be willing to help the person out based on the situation	11
21314	4104	Don't take away the chance for these authors to succeed more in life	12
21315	4104	Let these young adults read about everything they are interested in	13
21316	4104	I'm sure there are many different people who would be upset if the censored stories were eliminted from the shelves in libraries	14
21317	4105	Censorship, only for the light hearted	0
21318	4105	We have had this issue for as long as man can remeber	1
21319	4105	Since we were only little kids to adults	2
21320	4105	Everything was censored	3
21321	4105	Bleeps on the television to hide harmless words to random letters in curse words as if we did not know for example what @NUM1k spelt	4
21322	4105	I agree, censorship is needed for a certain period of time, but when that time goes on for to long and even in books and newspapers to limit what we can handle, that's when it goes out of hand	5
21323	4105	I am a highschool student and even I have to say limiting our reading because a book might have one or two bad words in it is just redicoulous	6
21324	4105	Its the most hipocritical thing to do because even science and anatomy books show certain parts of the body like genitalia but thats okay because its in a science book	7
21325	4105	However if its in a normal book, everythings a big deal and we can't handle it big woop	8
21326	4105	I say its a library, let us read what we want to read	9
21327	4105	Like i said before highschool is where the maturity hits and the censorship should be lowered	10
21328	4105	Im not saying just completly take it away but come on now I think highschool student can handle a few bad words in an outstanding book	11
21329	4105	As far a movies and music go, anything pornographic or just plain idiotic and demeaning should ofcourse be censored, but if theres just a few bad words why should that stop an entire school from enjoying some good music and possibly an amazing movie	12
21330	4105	So the point is, let there be censorship, but only to the point where people wont just take away music and books from us highschoolers for a few bad words	13
21331	4105	Censorship is for the lighthearted, and nothing is stopping the lighthearted people from not picking up that book with a few words in it they don't like, just dont read it	14
21332	4105	Thats all I have to say about censorship.	15
21333	4106	Read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 	0
21334	4106	Books, music, and movies all have a meaning and a purpose to them	1
21335	4106	In our spare time, we all enjoy to read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 the things that let us do so	2
21336	4106	These things keeps us all occupied when theres alot of time to spare	3
21337	4106	The library is a place where you can go read in peace and @CAPS1 to music with no distractions or anything, but there are somethings that are not cut out for the library	4
21338	4106	People find books at the library that they find very interesting and decides to check them out, but little do they know what the book and/or magazine has in it	5
21339	4106	Books come in all different genres and so do music and movies	6
21340	4106	And we all have our own views in what type of genre we enjoy listening, reading or watching	7
21341	4106	Genre comes in all kind of different types	8
21342	4106	For example, theres only one certain type of book for a child and which at the library should be picked out for a child to read and a child only	9
21343	4106	Theres also books for grown adults and adults only and once checked out, it should be kept from a childs hand or vision	10
21344	4106	Because children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand	11
21345	4106	All readings, music, or movies that have explicit or uncensored graphics or words should personally have their own section in the library	12
21346	4106	In this case, nothing bad could happen and everything is in place with everything else	13
21347	4106	Honestly all media actually should have their own section	14
21348	4106	For example, all kids media should be in one section and all adult media should be in another section	15
21349	4106	All books should be left on the shelves of every library, only because one knows what should be read and what shouldn't be read	16
21350	4106	A kids desired book is a childrens book with color and picture while on the other hand, an adult has their own type of selection	17
21351	4106	So books should stay where they belong and not tooken down from any self, that also goes for, movies, music, or any other media	18
21352	4107	The libraries have to worrie about enough as it is with people not retuning books and stuff in	0
21353	4107	They do not want to lose there books, music, movies, magazines just because some people find the offensive	1
21354	4107	Why would we have to talk something out that offens one person but no one else has complainded about it being offensive	2
21355	4107	I know that you are asking me to thank like you to be able to see why it is offensive but i dont see how a book is going to be offensive	3
21356	4107	When someone finds something that looks offensive then they do not have to take	4
21357	4107	There are people out there would would read something that is offensive to them so that they can lern from it	5
21358	4107	There is no reason why if you dont like the libary that you can not go to a differnt one	6
21359	4107	There is no reason for you to have to get so offensive of books because the authors is just trying to get their point accross and expressing their feeling on the subject	7
21360	4107	The way that i look at it is that you have two oppions	8
21361	4107	The frist being deal with it and go to the libary and get books	9
21362	4107	The second is dont go to the library if your going to be able to find something offensive	10
21363	4107	But know if you pick the second one then you must realize were ever you go you are going to find some thing the will make you feel offensive so your might as well just get over it and say yea i will go because its all around me	11
21364	4107	yes i know what you must be thinking why if its not a big deal then why dont you just take them out	12
21365	4107	Well you want an answer and i will give you one	13
21366	4107	Those books mayne you don't want to read them	14
21367	4107	But what if someone eles does its not fair to get reed of something just because afew people find it offensive know is it	15
21368	4107	There for i say that no we are not going to take books, music, movies, magazines and anything eles out of the libraries	16
21369	4107	You will just have to deal with what you dont want in here its not like were going to make you read something that you take offensive to	17
21370	4107	We will not going to get reed of the books, music, movies, magazines or anything else that we the library has	18
21371	4107	That is why everything that is in the library is staying in the library	19
21372	4108	Dear @ORGANIZATION1,     @CAPS1 I was growing up in my small little neighborhood, life could not have been more simple	0
21373	4108	For children, life is eating, sleeping, playing, and laughing	1
21374	4108	Their innocent minds do not ponder the meanings of life or of love, but curiosity does grab every child now and then	2
21375	4108	With a stubborn persistance, a child would probably go to the ends of the earth to understand what confidential information they overheard their parents talking about	3
21376	4108	But @CAPS1 does harmless curiosity mean the destruction of a child's innocence	4
21377	4108	By viewing adult-oriented material, such as books at a library, children can gain premature knowledge that can be harmful to their development	5
21378	4108	However, libraries should not fear stocking their shelves with books that are appropriate for adults because an author spend countless hours writing that book,  that book represents a portion of history for the human race, and not everyone @MONTH1 find the contents inappropriate	6
21379	4108	Authors have the freedom to write about whatever interests them, and taking away their right to display their thoughts and opinions is unjust	7
21380	4108	A censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice	8
21381	4108	Thus, an author that has practiced and perfected his writing skill does so in hopes of publishing his work	9
21382	4108	Not agreeing with someone's interest in a subject is no reason to exclude his valuable thoughts from society	10
21383	4108	Books that are appropriate for adults deserve to be displayed for adults as the author intended	11
21384	4108	Every piece of literature that has ever been written documents a portion of history of the human race	12
21385	4108	Even fictional novels serve as monuments to the depths of man's imagination	13
21386	4108	Therefore, no book should be censored, no matter how inappropriate the material is	14
21387	4108	Just as remembering the @CAPS2 has influenced mankind not to repeat past mistakes, keeping books of the most horrible content @MONTH1 save authors from repeating such dishonorable content	15
21388	4108	In other words, if censorship removes the 'mistakes' of literature from library shelves, who is to say that an oblivious author will not repeat that 'mistake'	16
21389	4108	By remembering these mistakes, mankind will be able to move forward in literature	17
21390	4108	@CAPS1 books are not 'mistakes', they serve as reminders of the high-points in literature	18
21391	4108	All literature, appropriate and inappropriate, is a piece of mankind's history that should not be kept a secret	19
21392	4108	Finally, who is to judge what is a 'mistake' in literature	20
21393	4108	A book on @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be inappropriate in the eyes of a @CAPS4, but that book @MONTH1 be sacred to a @CAPS5	21
21394	4108	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder	22
21395	4108	Furthermore, for any given book there is at least one person who disagrees with its message	23
21396	4108	A library is built for the education of the public, not for the interests of one person	24
21397	4108	If one is offended by a literary work, perhaps he should just move on and find a book more suited to his interests	25
21398	4108	The decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader, not the government or library or activist group	26
21399	4108	Censorship of material in libraries would strip authors of their chance to let their works be seen by others, keep records of the human race secret, and take away the privelage of the reader to decide what is appropriate	27
21400	4108	Authors endure long hours of practice and writing in order to have their thoughts read, and such a motive should not be taken away from them	28
21401	4108	Every book represents some aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid previous mistakes	29
21402	4108	And these 'mistakes' are decided by the reader, a decision that censorship takes upon itself	30
21403	4108	Instead of choosing what books are seen by the public, perhaps libraries should just create an adult-only section to house the 'controversial' books	31
21404	4108	as a result, mankind would stay educated and free, and children would remain innocent	32
21405	4108	-@ORGANIZATION2	33
21406	4109	There are many different perspetives on censorship in our country	0
21407	4109	This is the human race, opinionative that is	1
21408	4109	Different perspectives come from different people: young, old, parents, and children	2
21409	4109	In libraries there are some reading materials, that some @MONTH1 find offensive	3
21410	4109	Offensive material in libraries is @CAPS1 directed to be read by young children	4
21411	4109	They are also @CAPS1 inteded to be able to get there hands on such material	5
21412	4109	Even though this is @CAPS1 the purpose of that material, it happens that this material ends up in the hands of someone who shouldn't have it	6
21413	4109	No the material is @CAPS1 held under lock and key, but it is also @CAPS1 left to lay at a child high shelf that would seem appealing to them	7
21414	4109	The problem with removing all of this material from libraries would result in empty shelfs, except for the children's books	8
21415	4109	The material that would have to be removed are books meant for people of the appropriate age group to inform and tell good stories	9
21416	4109	If we protected children from censhorship this would deny knowledge, and also a get away for some, from the general public that anually go to the library.\     @CAPS1 all movies, books, music, and other materials are labeled as they should be	10
21417	4109	Some material @MONTH1 @CAPS1 be appropriate for children, but they also are @CAPS1 all inappropriate	11
21418	4109	A rated '@NUM1' movie @MONTH1 be just like a rated '@CAPS2' movie only with one extra reference, that @MONTH1 be taken in the wrong way	12
21419	4109	Even protective parents @MONTH1 allow their children to view movies like this as long as they find it appropriate	13
21420	4109	Libraries should @CAPS1 remove this material from their shelves	14
21421	4109	If it is that much of an issue, then they could have the children books in a seperate room of the library	15
21422	4109	There are many possibilities of keeping this kind of reading material away from children	16
21423	4109	All of which do @CAPS1 have the need of removing these books and other materials from the libraries' shelves	17
21424	4109	Censorship in libraries is a contraversial subject	18
21425	4109	There is a very good arguement on either side of whether or @CAPS1 to take offensive material off of shelves in the libraries	19
21426	4109	I believe it should @CAPS1 be taken off and there are alternatives to this	20
21427	4109	This essay proposed solutions to this problem without taking the public reading right away from everyone	21
21428	4110	@STATE1 @NUM1, @PERSON1, IN @CAPS1 Katherine Paterson,                                            I read your article in newspaper yesterday about offensive books in library	0
21429	4110	I agree with you on this article	1
21430	4110	Some of the books, music, movies, or magazines in public libraries are very offensive to me but they can be normal to other people.There can also be somw books that are normal to me and can be offensive to other people	2
21431	4110	Everyone have their own views and ideas on everything.The people of @LOCATION1 have freedom of speech so it is true that every mouth has got something differrent to say	3
21432	4110	There are some books or movies that children can not read or watch but children still do because once the child is in library he can read,watch, or listen to anything	4
21433	4110	You can not depend on librarian because there are other people in the library too.The librarian probably have other things to do like arranging the books or checking out the books or making library card or helping someone find a book	5
21434	4110	In my point of view, library should have diferent sections for different kinds of movies,books, or magazines and there should be person assigned for every section	6
21435	4110	This way children would not be able to go to older people's section	7
21436	4110	If there are books that are found offensive by everyone, then people should write a letter to president to help remove those books from library.Yours @NUM2.	8
21437	4111	Have you ever been in that situation where you couldn't read a book because of someone else having bitter feelings towards it	0
21438	4111	Are you furious when you finally get a chance to read that book you've been waiting on for two months and all of a sudden it's not to your avalible because of its content	1
21439	4111	I know I always amd because at @ORGANIZATION1 this happens quite often	2
21440	4111	I believe that a book shouldn't be removed because only one person found it to be offense	3
21441	4111	Sure some novels @MONTH1 expose a few word of profanity or discrimination but everyone has to deal with it	4
21442	4111	So why take one book off the shelf for saying something vaulger because not everyone might dislike the book	5
21443	4111	If we took a book off the shelf everytime someone reported a bad word or a discrimitive remark then we would be left with no books including the ones that tell us a great deal about past history	6
21444	4111	Some authors, movie directors and artist rely on history to help them create a great piece of reading, comentary, or lyrics	7
21445	4111	If the libraries in the public and in schools censored everything there could be a @ORGANIZATION1 risk of loosing alot of historic and epic material or information from the past	8
21446	4111	As im sure you know alot of history books about the holucaust, slavery, and the civil rights movement include words that people of certain genders or races @MONTH1 find offensive	9
21447	4111	These words are a vital source in the attempt to explain what the people in those situations are going through	10
21448	4111	therefore those words shouldn't be reported for histories sake	11
21449	4111	I know im not alone in my fight to keep books on the shelf because an author named Katherine Paterson says, ' ..	12
21450	4111	If i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same righ and so does everyone else	13
21451	4111	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson)	14
21452	4111	In this quote she is trying to say if people abuse this policy there will be no books left on the shelf for anyone to read becasue someone found something offensive to them	15
21453	4111	This is what will eventually happening if we don't censor the @CAPS1 in the libraries	16
21454	4111	Now don't mistake me for someone who believes that @CAPS1 should be dropped all together becasue I believe it is needed in some cases	17
21455	4111	If there is a song that use profanity multiple times without any logical reasoning then it shouldn't be availible to the public through a library	18
21456	4111	Also if there are inappropriate movies I don't think that they should be distributed by the library to the public becasue thats what movies rental stores are for	19
21457	4111	On the other hand I haven't found a single book that isn't suitable for the library	20
21458	4111	so why are there so many books being takin away every year due to what some people call '@CAPS1' also known as  self opinions	21
21459	4111	In this writing my goal was accomplished	22
21460	4111	I wanted to let everyone know that the whole @CAPS1 thing is getting a little out of hand	23
21461	4111	We all know that there is some offensive things that @MONTH1 be happening but they are things that everyone who views that book, movie, or soundtrack has to deal with	24
21462	4111	With some offensive things comes a reasoning like in history books and movies that @MONTH1 contain a few bad words but are used to get a point or setting across	25
21463	4111	I know that @CAPS1 is just another way of looking out for the better of humans but alot of it has a reason	26
21464	4111	The only case where @CAPS1 should be used is in innapropriate movies and songs with no hisrtoric purpose	27
21465	4111	With all that has been said, do you still believe in all of the @CAPS1 going on in your nearby library	28
21466	4111	How can you help prevent the destruction of all of the historic words in libraries?	29
21467	4113	No, I believe all materials should be on the shelfs at libraries	0
21468	4113	Because some people like stuff other people @MONTH1 find offensive	1
21469	4113	But you as parents should control what your kids are reading	2
21470	4113	If you find it offensive tell them to pick out a new book, new @CAPS1, a new movie, or a new magazine	3
21471	4113	If you don't its not their fault it's your fault	4
21472	4113	Some people like stuff that others don't	5
21473	4113	Such as, stuff from anther culture or maybe something from a different religion	6
21474	4113	But we can choose to read what ever you want to	7
21475	4113	If you don't like it find something else but, some people find it interesting	8
21476	4113	Not everyone has the same veiws on stuff	9
21477	4113	If there are books just for adults put it in anther room to were miniors can't get in	10
21478	4113	Make it to were you have to show an @CAPS2 that says you are @NUM1 or older to get in	11
21479	4113	Than you can look at inapporiate books without haveing to risk kids seeing them	12
21480	4113	Than in order to check them out if you're under the age of @NUM1 a parent or gaurdian has to be with you if you want to get it	13
21481	4113	If it's a @CAPS1 or musican that has cussing in it you need to be @NUM1 or older or have a parent check @NUM4 out for you	14
21482	4113	Because some parents don't let their kids listen to bad music	15
21483	4113	Like I said in pervious paragraphs I believe that they should't take stuff off the shelfs that a few or some people @MONTH1 find inapproite	16
21484	4113	Because a few of us might find it interesting to know that this world isn't all the same	17
21485	4113	People are different like different things	18
21486	4114	Everyone in the world has different opinions	0
21487	4114	Some people care about things that other people don't care about at all	1
21488	4114	One topic that seems to get everyone going is censorship	2
21489	4114	Everyone has an opinion on it	3
21490	4114	and not everyone agrees with eachother	4
21491	4114	All libraries have different sections based upon age	5
21492	4114	There are childrens sections, teens sections, and adult sections	6
21493	4114	I think censorship has a lot to do with maturity levels	7
21494	4114	Things in books and movies that aren't appropriate for children, shouldn't be put in the children section	8
21495	4114	I understand parents' don't want their children reading or watching abscene material	9
21496	4114	but as kids are growing up, they're going to learn about the innapropriate things sooner or later in school	10
21497	4114	I don't think anything should be taken off of a shelf just because a handful of parents find the material offensive	11
21498	4114	I don't take censorship very seriously	12
21499	4114	Some parents want their children reading books with innapropriate material so they can learn about what goes on in the world and what life is like	13
21500	4114	Most children and some teens don't know what the world is like because they don't get out much	14
21501	4114	They don't learn things that they should know already	15
21502	4114	Reading is a way of learning	16
21503	4114	When someone wants to know more information about any place or anything, they go to the library and check out a book	17
21504	4114	For a school project or just for fun	18
21505	4114	Most parents agree that nothing innappropriate should be in a childrens' section at a library	19
21506	4114	Just because they're young and parents don't want their kids going around at the age of @NUM1 cussing like a sailor	20
21507	4114	But I think that teens are mature enough to read or watch innappropriate material like a book with cussing or a movie with kissing scenes	21
21508	4114	Parents shouldn't have a say on what goes on or off the shelves in a library	22
21509	4114	They should just mind their own business	23
21510	4114	If their kid picks out a book that they think is too offensive for them to read, then they can just simply tell them that they cannot get the book	24
21511	4114	It's as simple as that	25
21512	4114	Parents who ask for books to get taken off the shelf are just asking for too much	26
21513	4114	Censorship in libraries is not a big deal to me	27
21514	4114	I think kids should be able to read a book that they want to read	28
21515	4114	At least they're wanting to read	29
21516	4114	Let them read for @PERSON1's sake	30
21517	4114	But like I said, everyone has their own opinions.	31
21518	4116	What should and should'nt be censored in a library really is just a matter of opinion from the people using the library	0
21519	4116	If everyone were to removed what they didnt like from the shelves of a library then much information would be less acceceble to the general public	1
21520	4116	Although some people @MONTH1 be offended by some forms of literature, this doesnt mean that the literature should be removed from everyone	2
21521	4116	I beleive a solution must be made to satisfy everyone	3
21522	4116	Currently, some people arent happy with some of the books, music, movies, and magazines that are available at many libraries	4
21523	4116	They believe that the information @MONTH1 be unsuitable for some veiwers	5
21524	4116	Some people just do not want certain information getting in the minds of children	6
21525	4116	While that is a very solid reason to censor what goes into our libraries	7
21526	4116	there are others who dissagree with the thought of censoring our libraries	8
21527	4116	By allowing the censoring of libraries it would decrease the amount of information available to the public	9
21528	4116	If parents allow their children to take out certain materials without first checking whats behind the cover, then the parents have noone to blame but themselves	10
21529	4116	I believe that this could all be resovled by simply having parents fill out a form before allowing their children to get a library card	11
21530	4116	This form would include a list of things that they would want to prevent their kids from checking out such as: swearing in books and music, nudity in movies and magazines	12
21531	4116	This information would be put with the cerial number of the library card	13
21532	4116	If their child were to checkout something that is restricted on the list, the librarian would tell them to put the book back and pick another book	14
21533	4116	I can see how censorship is very useful and important	15
21534	4116	Although sometimes it can be takin a bit to the extreme	16
21535	4116	There is a solution out there, but we just need to find it.	17
21536	4117	In the library I have noticed that there are a few literature materials that are not suitable for a younger age group	0
21537	4117	Such as rated @CAPS1 movies that contain things like drug use, sexual content, and extreme violence	1
21538	4117	Not all libraries have movies, and the ones that do don't let anyone under the age of @NUM1 rent out a rated @CAPS1 movie	2
21539	4117	Another example would be magazines that have articles/advertisments and pictures that are more towards the sexual side	3
21540	4117	This is a problem with children because then they think that that's how they should look and act, when they are older	4
21541	4117	Most libraries are divided up into different sections, there is a section for adults, teens, and children	5
21542	4117	The sections were created for a reason to show/tell people that some materials in this section @MONTH1 not be suitable for teens and children	6
21543	4117	Then if your in a childrens section you know that not many over the age of @NUM2 will be wanting to look around for books	7
21544	4117	In the childrens section a library normally makes it look bright and colorful which most children love	8
21545	4117	This helps the children stay there and not wonder off into one of the adult or teen sections	9
21546	4117	When I was younger I didn't really care to go into the adult or teen sections cause I enjoyed reading 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4', '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8', and many other children books there	10
21547	4117	Children have a lot of things to satisfy them at the library there's children movies/shows like '@CAPS9 @PERSON1'	11
21548	4117	They also have an unlimited amout of books that can keep them entertained	12
21549	4117	If movies and books don't work for them then there are also a few toys they can play with (at least the libraries I've been to have toys)	13
21550	4117	The only real big problem with having things unapropriate in the library is that the younger teens might wander into the adult section, and sometimes there are adult things in the young adult section	14
21551	4117	Again with the movies, there are tv shows that I've seen at the library that are about teens doing drugs going to parties and getting drunk	15
21552	4117	Things like that I think put a bad influence on younger teens	16
21553	4117	Making them think it's okay to do drugs and drink, that it will make them more popular and cool	17
21554	4117	Over all I think that libraries just need to reorganize there books, movies, and magazines	18
21555	4117	Then all the right items will be put in the right sections and there will be no accidents where someone accidently picks up something that is inapropitate for their age group	19
21556	4117	The music in the library I don't think is much of a problem	20
21557	4117	To me music is something more to express your feelings	21
21558	4117	This is my view on censorship in libraries	22
21559	4118	@CAPS6 are many books out @CAPS6 that, if looked into, have something obsene or vulgar in it	0
21560	4118	Despite the fact that children of certain ages probably shouldn't be reading these types of things, the book itself should not be banned from the shelves of libraries	1
21561	4118	Authors write or type every word for a reason, whether happy or sad or vulgar	2
21562	4118	@CAPS6 is a reason the author wants the reader to read these 'offensive' things	3
21563	4118	Everything you read in a book is @CAPS6 because the author wanted you to read it, not to just put it @CAPS6 to fill in or to be nasty	4
21564	4118	I agree that children shouldn't read these books with that kind of material in them but that doesn't mean take the books down	5
21565	4118	The library where I live has sections for children, teens, and adults so that @CAPS6 is no confusion or concern of the content of the book	6
21566	4118	You have to be of age in order to take some of the readings home	7
21567	4118	I personally think that this is a great idea and will comprimise both sides that don't want their kids reading these books and those who want to read the book without getting rid of anything	8
21568	4118	If the latter was taken in to effect though, some of the classic and prize winning books would be taken off the shelves, such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, The @PERSON1, @CAPS3 @CAPS4's @CAPS5, and much more	9
21569	4118	Such harsh actions aren't neccasary when a much simpler and more effective way to be accomplished	10
21570	4118	Although offesive material is a concern for children @CAPS6 are much better ways to have it so they can't read them until ready	11
21571	4118	No book should be taken off a shelf for its content.	12
21572	4119	I feel that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves	0
21573	4119	Just because some one @MONTH1 finds them offensive	1
21574	4119	They only become offensive when people think they are	2
21575	4119	I feel this way because no one is forcing any ony to watch or read any thing they dont want to	3
21576	4119	No one is telling sudents what they can and can't watch or read	4
21577	4119	Every one has the choice	5
21578	4119	To choose what they want to read or watch	6
21579	4119	what one person @MONTH1 find offensive and wrang	7
21580	4119	Another person	8
21581	4119	@MONTH1 find interesting and exiting	9
21582	4119	I have felt the same way before, but that still gives me no resone to take it off the shelf	10
21583	4119	The next person after me	11
21584	4119	Has as much the same right as I did	12
21585	4119	The person has the right to watch or read what I have	13
21586	4119	To like or hate what ever is on the shelves	14
21587	4119	There are lots of things in a @CAPS5	15
21588	4119	Other than things that people @MONTH1 find offensive	16
21589	4119	There are scary books like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON2	17
21590	4119	There are mistury books like 'The @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS3 another @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON1	18
21591	4119	So to some up my esay	19
21592	4119	Nothing sould be taken off @CAPS5 shelves	20
21593	4119	Just because i or any one else finds them offensive	21
21594	4121	Books being taken off the shelves	0
21595	4121	No way	1
21596	4121	The @CAPS1 is the place to go if you want books, movies, music, etc., that fit what you like and want	2
21597	4121	Should some material be taken off the shelves all because of it offending someone else	3
21598	4121	No, because Libraries are ment for everyone for a reason	4
21599	4121	Everybody is diffrent	5
21600	4121	Which means everyone comes to the @CAPS1 for diffrent types of information	6
21601	4121	If the libraries took off all material that offended people there would be nothing left	7
21602	4121	What offends someone @MONTH1 not offend someone else	8
21603	4121	For example, the libraries have information on the @ORGANIZATION1 history	9
21604	4121	While some people like that kind of information and want to continue learing about it, the information is also offending @CAPS2 @CAPS3 who it talks about	10
21605	4121	But really if you think about it, its all selfish to take away material someone else wants to learn about	11
21606	4121	It would be keeping the next generations to come from learning everything they possibly could or wanted to	12
21607	4121	When people go to the @CAPS1 they know, no matter what information their looking for, they will find it	13
21608	4121	Isn't that whats so great about trips to the @CAPS1	14
21609	4121	Looking and finding things you never learned about, even if it offends others	15
21610	4121	All that matters is that your head is holding more knowlege about that certain subject	16
21611	4121	It will never be okay to take certain material off the shelves that offends other people because libraries are ment for everyone for a reason	17
21612	4122	Should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	0
21613	4122	I do not think that certain materials should be removed for many reasons	1
21614	4122	Many different people have many different thoughts on whats offensive and what isn't like some people will find something funny that some people @MONTH1 think is nasty or inapropiate	2
21615	4122	If you was to take things off the shelves that someone found offensive there probably wouldn't be much left on the shelves because everybody has they're own oppenion	3
21616	4122	I agree that certain things shouldn't be seen by young eyes but thats the parents decision, not everyone has the same view on the material	4
21617	4122	Certian materials should not be removed from shelves because of one persons oppenion on it	5
21618	4122	Everyone has they're own oppenion, some people like what other people don't everyone is different in they're own way	6
21619	4123	I firmly believe that the removing of books, music, movies, ect., from a shelf just because someone finds it offensive will not solve the problem	0
21620	4123	A person can find many things in life offensive to their personal views, but they can not just remove them	1
21621	4123	To remove books, music, movies, ect., from people who do not find them offensive could provoke chaos	2
21622	4123	As Katherine Paterson stated 'And then we have no books left.' If everyone were to choose books, music, movies, ect., they felt were offensive and should not be placed in the library the statement would probably be true	3
21623	4123	Besides the point the library is sectioned off into different genres, so if you have a different view of a certain genre of books, movies, music, etc., skip over that section and go to the genre in which you prefer	4
21624	4123	In other words, the things that @MONTH1 offend one person @MONTH1 not offend another person	5
21625	4123	So to remove one particular thing would be unreasonable for the person who likes or finds interest in a particular subject	6
21626	4123	So instead of there being a problem with one person there would a problem with two unsatisfied people	7
21627	4123	Not saying that it is right, but the library has done particular things such as, separating the books for reasons like this	8
21628	4123	According to Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' The library has a section for children only	9
21629	4123	Therefore worries of problem like this have already been solved	10
21630	4123	The books, music, movies, ect., in the childrens section is age apprioate for a child	11
21631	4123	Books, music, movies, ect., are also sectioned off for teenagers and adults	12
21632	4123	In conclusion, the removal of books, music, movies, ect., that are found offensive by others @MONTH1 not be found offensive by someone else	13
21633	4123	It is not like the library would purposely offend anyone by having the books, music, movies, ect., on the shelfs	14
21634	4123	If you are mature enough to understand that and over look something that @MONTH1 offend you, you would not be so offended	15
21635	4123	Also if the library is sectioned off into different genre, you can easly by pass a particular genre you wish to avoid	16
21636	4123	Problems can  be easily solved if they are dealt with in the correct manner.	17
21637	4125	Keep it on the Shelf	0
21638	4125	What types of things do you go to the library for	1
21639	4125	Some go for books and others go just to relax in a quiet environment	2
21640	4125	Yes, the library is mostly used for books and studying, but there are many other things that libraries contain	3
21641	4125	Movies, magazines, music, etc., are all found in a library	4
21642	4125	Now, say you had to listen to a specific song, read a certain book, or review an article in a certain magazine, and you can't find it at the library because they have been removed because they are found to be offensive	5
21643	4125	All people have different views on what is and isn't offensive	6
21644	4125	Everything like books, music, magazines, and movies should all have their place in a library, regaurdless of the material	7
21645	4125	Books can be used for many things	8
21646	4125	Some read just for the enjoyment and others read because it is assigned to them or they need to research some things	9
21647	4125	Books give information and knowledge that some people need desperately	10
21648	4125	What if you can't find that book because someone said that its material is inappropiate	11
21649	4125	What are you supposed to do about your research paper now	12
21650	4125	If a book is needed it should be able to be found on the shelf in a library and not be taken out because of the content of its pages	13
21651	4125	Music is a great way to clear your mind and relax	14
21652	4125	Some music found in libraries can be somewhat offensive to some people	15
21653	4125	What if the only place you can find your favorite music is at your public library	16
21654	4125	You walk in and they no longer have it because it is considered to be offensive	17
21655	4125	Now you can no longer listen to the sounds that calm you down or modivate you to get your day started	18
21656	4125	Music should remain in libraries because of the cultural and educational sounds that most cannot find at their local music store	19
21657	4125	Magazines are another great form of reading material found in a library	20
21658	4125	Magazines are a great way to stay up to date with the latest fashions and great dessert receipes	21
21659	4125	Without magazines our world wouldn't be able to keep up with the things that advance in our world everyday	22
21660	4125	Magazines show us the hottest trends, the gossip in the celebrity world, and some great facts from educational magazines	23
21661	4125	Without the magizines in the library we probably wouldn't know anything about our advancing world	24
21662	4125	You can find movies anywhere, but some believe that you can only find the really good and old movies at the library	25
21663	4125	The library has educational movies for children that @MONTH1 not be available anywhere else	26
21664	4125	They also have old classic movies that aren't even around anymore	27
21665	4125	The library has many movies that you wouldn't be able to find in our advanced world today	28
21666	4125	Libraries hold a lot of important books, movies, music, and magazines	29
21667	4125	Without out most of that, regaurdless of the material, we probably wouldn't know as much as we know today	30
21668	4125	The library has always been a place where you go to find exactly what you want and you know that they will have it	31
21669	4125	Removing these things from the shelves can be taking some history right out of our lives	32
21670	4125	All of theses resources should stay on the shelves regaurdless of their material.	33
21671	4126	Can literature, which is the basis of civilization, be censored	0
21672	4126	Can you take these ideas away from those who wish to think them	1
21673	4126	I think not, for it would be a futile endeavor to even attempt	2
21674	4126	To keep something as important as written word away from the culture of the people, would be one of the highest crimes against humanity and could not rightly be condoned, in my mind	3
21675	4126	Not only would this attempt be a futile (for the people know ways to extract information) it would be downright idiotic of the 'administration' to do so	4
21676	4126	I will concede that there are explicit materials out there that are not suitable for children or even adolescents, but that is where the parent should step in by setting guidelines and positive examples which their children feel the need to follow	5
21677	4126	Not feel that they 'have' to, but feel that they 'need' to	6
21678	4126	If parents cannot take control and decide what is appropriate for their children, then in my mind, they are not doing their first and foremost job as a parent that is to protect the child	7
21679	4126	Some @MONTH1 say that the censorship of culture is protecting the children, but I say that this is not so	8
21680	4126	I believe censorship is a lousy excuse so that parents and upper government officials have to do less work	9
21681	4126	If every piece of written, filmed, or recorded work, that was offensve only one person, was thrown out on that basis, there would be none	10
21682	4126	There has never been a piece of literature, film, or music that has not offended someone in some way, whether it be spiritually, ethnically, or morally	11
21683	4126	The fact is that people cannot exist without strife and misery, and whatever people can do to cause that strife and misery, they will	12
21684	4126	People find all sorts of ways to do it, whether it be war, discrimination, media, or just downright obstinance, they will find a way to offend their selected party	13
21685	4126	I personally am appalled at the aspect of censorship, for if a person cannot speak his mind, then is he more than a mindless homunculi	14
21686	4126	Created and controlled by the government surrounding him	15
21687	4126	Made their slave through ignorance	16
21688	4126	If in a society I  cannot say what I need to say then I do not wish to live in that society, for it is nothing but a horrible image of civilization	17
21689	4126	In short I do not believe that libraries should be censored, rather that parents should pay more attention to their children and dependents	18
21690	4126	If a person is offended by a certain thing, then it is their absolute right to not take part in whatever it @MONTH1 be, but these afflicted peoples have absolutely NO right to say what I @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not read	19
21691	4126	If this offends anyone, then I apologize, but at least you knew enough (through your education by media) to be offended and not just another mindless sheep	20
21692	4127	Do you think that some materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive to people	0
21693	4127	This is a question that all of us have thought about at one point or another	1
21694	4127	For some, it just depends on your age, your beliefs, and if you actually know if it is offensive in the first place	2
21695	4127	In my opinion, I think that the offensive materials should be taken off the shelves	3
21696	4127	First of all, I think a lot of it depends on your age	4
21697	4127	For, example, most older people think that most of the material made today is just crazy and do not want anyhting to do with them	5
21698	4127	Although, for the younger people, thet is what is new and 'cool' to do	6
21699	4127	I do not believe that anything bad or offensive should be shown to any little kids	7
21700	4127	We want to keep it away from them so that in the future, they know not to use it	8
21701	4127	In my own experience, my parents kept me away from all of the bad stuff for the most part	9
21702	4127	I think it has affected me a lot today on who I am today	10
21703	4127	Next, I think for some people, it depends on their beleifs	11
21704	4127	A big thing with this is race and culture	12
21705	4127	I often find books, movies, or magazines offending another race	13
21706	4127	This the the thing that I find most disturbing about some materials	14
21707	4127	Anything offending another race or culture should be taken off the shelves immediately in my opinion	15
21708	4127	There are countless numbers of these materials just theat I have seen and I am sure that there are many more	16
21709	4127	It @MONTH1 be impossible to ever get every single one of these off the shelves	17
21710	4127	Lastly, I think that a lot of people do not know that what they are going to read, watch, or listen to, is going to end up being offensive	18
21711	4127	I have seen a countless number of movies and listen to a countless number of songs that were offensive	19
21712	4127	The sad thing is, I did not know it before I did it	20
21713	4127	A lot of people just go into their material as blind as a bat, as far as knowing if it is offensive goes	21
21714	4127	I think that if the material is not taken off of the shelves, then it should at least be marked as offensive	22
21715	4127	All in all, I think that the material should just simply be taken off of the shelves	23
21716	4127	We have gotten to the point where there is so much out there that it is nearly impossible to do	24
21717	4127	Even though there are factors like age, beliefs, and knowing what you are going into, I think these materials are just bad for everyone	25
21718	4127	In my opinion, offensive materials should be taken off of the shelves	26
21719	4128	Have you ever came across offensive material inside a library	0
21720	4128	Well some people have and they think there should be  some type of censorship in libraires to protect the offended people 	1
21721	4128	I do not agree with this idea because people should have the right to express their self through art, literature, and even music	2
21722	4128	After all the freedom of speech is written in our rights	3
21723	4128	Many authors , artist and musicans have the freedom to express themselves through their work	4
21724	4128	If they saw their own work in a library being censored it would be very offensive to them	5
21725	4128	I understand that the artist's material could be offensive to certain people but it is their work ,a form of self expression	6
21726	4128	They do not publish their work to offend people , they do it for themselves and for other people to enjoy it	7
21727	4128	An artist's work is a part of who they are	8
21728	4128	A censor would just put a negative aspect to the art and literature of the library	9
21729	4128	Over many years most libraries have devloped and arranged their media into a system called @CAPS1 @CAPS2	10
21730	4128	This system seperates all books, magazines, music, and movies into their own genres	11
21731	4128	For instince if you are looking for a mystery book , you would find it in the non fiction section	12
21732	4128	This system helps people find exactly what they are looking for	13
21733	4128	If people are offended by a certain genre they do not have to come in contact with it	14
21734	4128	This system is a better way to find exactly what you want instead of coming across a book or movie that you would find offensive	15
21735	4128	Almost every library uses this system so they do not have to use a censor	16
21736	4128	Everywhere we go someone somewhere is going to find something offensive	17
21737	4128	It is basically part of our human nature	18
21738	4128	It is truly impossible to make every single person happy with everything in the world	19
21739	4128	In a library there will always be a book that someone disagrees with or someone will find it offensive	20
21740	4128	The author of that book and other people who enjoyed it  do not need to be punished by having the book taken off the shelves	21
21741	4128	Just because the book offends one person does not mean it has to be taken off the shelf or have a censor	22
21742	4128	If everytime that happend there would be no books left to read in our libraries	23
21743	4128	Most people would not even call that a library	24
21744	4128	In the end a book is a book , music is music and we are not going to create censors or take books of the shelves because it is offensive to people	25
21745	4128	Authors write what they want to write , musicans play what they want to play, and actors act how they want to act	26
21746	4128	After everything  it does not matter what is offensive to people , they will just have to deal with it	27
21747	4128	There is no reason for a censor in a library	28
21748	4129	'Everyone has @CAPS1 @CAPS2'     @CAPS3 is true that everyone has their own @CAPS2 and their likes and dislikes	0
21749	4129	For example, books	1
21750	4129	I do not like books that are about illegal substances, but I do believe removing certain materials that are offensive should not be removed from the shelves in the library	2
21751	4129	@CAPS3 is true that finding inappropriate book or an article @MONTH1 be disturbing to certain people, but @CAPS3 does not mean that everyone finds @CAPS3 offenive	3
21752	4129	Once, my @CAPS4 class was assigned to do a book project	4
21753	4129	The main pourpose was to find a non-fiction book and create a powerpoint presentation on the main ideas of that book	5
21754	4129	One of the classmate read and had a breif presentaion over a book that was about illegal drugs	6
21755	4129	I know in fact that not many people are offended by the words such as 'drugs' or 'alchol', but I find these words to be obnoxious	7
21756	4129	While I found @CAPS3 disturbing and uncomfortable, others found @CAPS3 interesting	8
21757	4129	@CAPS3 was a topic that drew their attention, but not very appealing to me	9
21758	4129	Another example would be the time I went to the library to write a research paper about the human body systems	10
21759	4129	My friend, @LOCATION1, found @CAPS3 disturbing to look at some pictures because @CAPS3 showed blood	11
21760	4129	Strangly, I never thought blood as anything disturbing	12
21761	4129	While @PERSON1 found @CAPS3 disgusting to look at, my head was in the book because @CAPS3 was fascinating	13
21762	4129	I always thought how the human body works is incredible	14
21763	4129	What @PERSON1 did was instead of trying to deal with the picture, she wondered off and tried to find another book that does not have any grotesque pictures	15
21764	4129	The book did not have any benefit to @LOCATION1, but because of that book, I received an 'A' on the research paper	16
21765	4129	I believe @CAPS3 is important that people accept the fact that everyone does not have the same opinion	17
21766	4129	Every individual is different in their own way	18
21767	4129	As I mentioned before, the book that was disturbing to me was interesting to others and vice versa	19
21768	4129	That is normal and there is nothing we can do to change about @CAPS3	20
21769	4129	If permission were given to remove any certain materials that is offensive to each and every person, I guarentee that there would not be any material left on the shelves	21
21770	4129	I think the best way to solve this problem is for he/she to ignore the book that seems to be offensive and look for different material because others might need the resource	22
21771	4130	I believe that if something or someone offends you, you have the right to take a stand	0
21772	4130	You shouldn't have to deal with it	1
21773	4130	If something is offensive in your library, it has no right to be there	2
21774	4130	A library is supposed to be a helpfull place	3
21775	4130	Who would want to sit back and watch a raciest movie	4
21776	4130	Who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie	5
21777	4130	Magazines can even develope a lot of problems	6
21778	4130	Muisc can be straight offensive	7
21779	4130	If a young adult or a child reads or watches a movie that is raciest, it teaches them bad things	8
21780	4130	Racism is a very hurtful thing	9
21781	4130	What you see or read can really have an affect on you	10
21782	4130	You @MONTH1 not realise that it is wrong	11
21783	4130	It could have you saying hurtful things to a differant race	12
21784	4130	If a person isn't raciest and they see something that is, it could offend them	13
21785	4130	They @MONTH1 feel like they 'cool'	14
21786	4130	They go out and say raciest things	15
21787	4130	It makes them feel good	16
21788	4130	Later on they feel guilty	17
21789	4130	All because of a movie or book	18
21790	4130	If a movie is making fun of your race, it hurts	19
21791	4130	Being made fun of hurts	20
21792	4130	It is technicly bullying	21
21793	4130	Bullying can lead to suicide	22
21794	4130	Who cares if someone is black or white	23
21795	4130	We are all the same deep down inside	24
21796	4130	Movies like this should be banned from public libraries	25
21797	4130	Movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them	26
21798	4130	Sex, drugs, cursing, etc	27
21799	4130	Kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything	28
21800	4130	The librarian just swipes your card, then you have the movie.They @MONTH1 not know right from wrong	29
21801	4130	If they see someone doing drugs or having sex, they might think that it is cool	30
21802	4130	They @MONTH1 go out and do it	31
21803	4130	We do not need movies like this in our public library	32
21804	4130	We should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this	33
21805	4130	These moives can also offend us	34
21806	4130	Make us feel uncool	35
21807	4130	Make us feel like we have to go out and try it	36
21808	4130	In magizines today, they make everyone look so perfect	37
21809	4130	These people can offend you	38
21810	4130	Young teenage girls or even boys are the ones mostly looking at magizines	39
21811	4130	If you see @PERSON1 in a magizine, you begin to want to look like her	40
21812	4130	You see how skinny she is	41
21813	4130	She is tan	42
21814	4130	She has perfect skin	43
21815	4130	Its normal for someone to be jeleous	44
21816	4130	We are only human	45
21817	4130	Sometimes these images get to us	46
21818	4130	We @MONTH1 starve ourselves to try to be skinny	47
21819	4130	That can be very dangerous to your health	48
21820	4130	These girls knock our confidence down	49
21821	4130	Into today's society, people stive for popularity	50
21822	4130	They want to look perfect	51
21823	4130	They want all the guys to stair	52
21824	4130	We use the girls in the magizine to helps us know what we want to look like	53
21825	4130	You should love who you are and what you look like	54
21826	4130	You are unique	55
21827	4130	No one has to be skinny to be pretty	56
21828	4130	Magizines can be offensive	57
21829	4130	In today's society music is horrible	58
21830	4130	Rap, country, or rock music	59
21831	4130	Some of the lyrics can really offend people	60
21832	4130	The words get in your head everytime you hear the song	61
21833	4130	If you really take the time to look up lyrics to a song, you will realise that they will let you say anything	62
21834	4130	I can't name how many songs I know, just beeing a teenager, that make fun of something	63
21835	4130	For example, there is a song by the band @ORGANIZATION1	64
21836	4130	It is called 'I must be emo'	65
21837	4130	It makes fun of people who are unique in their own way	66
21838	4130	Some lines from the song are, '@CAPS1 I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction'	67
21839	4130	How can you make fun of someone who does self harm	68
21840	4130	Depression and self harm are a big thing in today's society	69
21841	4130	Their is nothing funny about it	70
21842	4130	If someone who hurts themselves hears this, think of what could happen	71
21843	4130	It would really offend them	72
21844	4130	They could go and cut theirselves even more	73
21845	4130	They could try suicide	74
21846	4130	In the song it also makes fun of gay people	75
21847	4130	It makes fun of the way 'emo' people look	76
21848	4130	'I look like I am dead and dress like a homo', is another line from the song	77
21849	4130	I don't know about you but to me that would be terribly offensive	78
21850	4130	We need to get these types of songs out of our libraries	79
21851	4130	We should have a say to what is in our public library	80
21852	4130	The library is ment to be a good place	81
21853	4130	Anyone can go their	82
21854	4130	We are all unique in our own ways	83
21855	4130	If something is offensive to you, you have the right to stand up for yourself	84
21856	4130	We need to make offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., harder to get a hold of.	85
21857	4132	Shut down libraries	0
21858	4132	Yes, I do, because music, movies, etc	1
21859	4132	could not only contain unnessisarry attire, they could also contain potty mouth language	2
21860	4132	The words could, and can, corupt the minds of youngsters	3
21861	4132	All librairies put them there because of the needs of customers	4
21862	4132	The things they do to make some cash around here, do you agree with me	5
21863	4132	They should create seperate libraries for each type of reader	6
21864	4132	Still, they put all of these things in the same building	7
21865	4132	They should put up sales for kids' movies not adults, but the librarians say 'books are books'	8
21866	4132	I think I'll write my own @CAPS1 sieries, thank you very much	9
21867	4132	However, because some have dull enviornments, or lack of customers, some libraries close down	10
21868	4132	Make use of that thought I just told you	11
21869	4132	I wonder if some books on endangered species of fish	12
21870	4132	But some kid's sieries are dieing of because of more popular ones, or being replaced by some family stories	13
21871	4132	If a little kid were to listen to some cursing, his/her mind will be warped for life	14
21872	4132	What chic-cursing out loud in front of the baby	15
21873	4132	How about saying '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 that?..' or '@CAPS4 that ball, you meanie!'	16
21874	4132	Maybe THAT will give some education	17
21875	4132	However, some older boys and girls are teaching this bad language to the young mind-maybe even before they learn good language	18
21876	4132	Those dilenguents don't care about their minds at all	19
21877	4132	Your honor, I have my proof right here	20
21878	4132	I suggest reeducating those teenage dilenguents to acting more @CAPS1.	21
21879	4133	With the world having a wide variation of cultures, languages, beliefs, and races, there is no doubt that different subjects will be offensive to some and not to others	0
21880	4133	Books, songs, magazines, and movies all have purposes as to why they were created	1
21881	4133	This @MONTH1 be to entertain, inform, or persuade	2
21882	4133	People use libraries as a source to see these works	3
21883	4133	Many people use libraries every day to research or simply to gain knowledge for fun	4
21884	4133	My opinion is that any type of material, no matter what it contains, should be able to be found on a library shelf	5
21885	4133	A library is a place where one should be able to find a book, cd, video, or magazine or any subject that interests them	6
21886	4133	If our libraries took out every item that was offensive to someone, there would simply be no library	7
21887	4133	Any item you read or listen to will have a word, sentence, or meaning that will offend a person in some way	8
21888	4133	This is because many of the items you will find will be in some way biased	9
21889	4133	The way an author tries to entertain @MONTH1 offend you if they use a certain language with a certain tone	10
21890	4133	Persuasion is also biased towards one side and you @MONTH1 not agree with the side the author chooses	11
21891	4133	The same goes with informing	12
21892	4133	You @MONTH1 think the author needed to address a certain point more than he or she did	13
21893	4133	All of these purposes of writing will be offensive to someone	14
21894	4133	I once was in a library and read a magazine talking bad about teenage drivers	15
21895	4133	The article was obviously biased and did not have any teen sources to prove that not all teen drivers are bad	16
21896	4133	This article deeply offended me, but I am glad I read it and saw a different point of view	17
21897	4133	Not everyone wants to see the different points to a story, but if you happen to run across one of these items that offend you, you can simply put it back down on the shelf	18
21898	4133	You are not required to read or listen to any item that you do not want to see or hear	19
21899	4133	However, there is going to be someone who needs to use that item for personal knowledge or for research	20
21900	4133	This is why all items need to be available to the public	21
21901	4133	If someone does find an item offensive though, they should be able to request that a label be put on the item to further warn other readers	22
21902	4133	Likewise, if there is an item rated '@CAPS1' there needs to be an age limit set to protect our young readers and listeners	23
21903	4133	With these changes set, our libraries could make everyone happy	24
21904	4133	With libraries being found in most communities, there is going to be discussion on the contents of the items they carry	25
21905	4133	While you @MONTH1 like a book, I @MONTH1 find it offensive	26
21906	4133	Even though I @MONTH1 have a problem with an item, it still needs to be able to be accessed by all people	27
21907	4133	The point of a library is to carry items which will benefit the public	28
21908	4133	It is the right of any human to be able to go to a library and be able to read about any subject he or she wants	29
21909	4133	Any item, whether biased or not, should be able to be found on the shelves of a library	30
21910	4133	Those who do not agree with or want to read an item should simply stay away from that section and choose a different item which interests him	31
21911	4133	We need to be able to go to a library and find what we need or want to see or hear	32
21912	4133	This is how a library serves a community	33
21913	4134	As a place used to gain knowledge and wisdom, a library is a wonderful resource	0
21914	4134	Multiple variaties of books @MONTH1 be found at a local library from documantaries to science-fictoin or just fiction	1
21915	4134	The most amazing part of a library is the fact that one @MONTH1 choose what he or she reads	2
21916	4134	Yet if one man opposses the view in one book and believes a certain book should be removed from the library, then the freedom of choice is lost	3
21917	4134	The selection of reading should be open to every reader, and although some @MONTH1 disagree, heavy censorship of libraries is an unnecessary meassure that constricts the ability to gain knowlegde	4
21918	4134	In today's society, many people differ in taste or genre	5
21919	4134	So much so, that at times it is hard to find a common ground in a large group setting	6
21920	4134	The library is a place where people @MONTH1 be able to enjoy their diferences, reading different types of books spread across many shelves	7
21921	4134	Yet if one person dilikes a book, their opinion should not influence the removal of the book due to their preference	8
21922	4134	Author Katherine Paterson made a wise remark on the idea of censorship saying, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	9
21923	4134	And then we have no books'(no pag.)	10
21924	4134	If one person finds a work to be vulgar and believes it shuld be removed from the library, then what stops another person from removing a book that they dislike	11
21925	4134	If heavy censorship is allowed in libraries, then libraries will become diminished resources, only containing a few documents	12
21926	4134	Still, censoring age specific materials is necessary in libraries	13
21927	4134	Allowing a child to read or watch a movie or book that is inapropriate, is an inexscusable action	14
21928	4134	Censoring books for children does not mean removal of said book though	15
21929	4134	Removing a book from the shelf of a library is just as wrong as allowing a child to read a book that is too mature for his or her age	16
21930	4134	Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none osf our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	17
21931	4134	But..	18
21932	4134	then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'(no pag.)	19
21933	4134	The censoring of books in a library cannot lead to the removal of books that have shaped our society and ideas, even if it is to protect a child	20
21934	4134	A medium must be found between true censorship and opinionated removal of books, due to one's belifes	21
21935	4134	Doing so will not only help libraries but also society	22
21936	4134	There are many different opinions in modern society and due to the differences in beliefs and ideas, at times people will disagree	23
21937	4134	Yet it is important that poeple agree on allowing each other to have a choice	24
21938	4134	A very important choice that each individual makes on a daily basis is what to read	25
21939	4134	Libraries allow for people to make their choices and help to expand one's knowledge in the process	26
21940	4134	Literature, whether it is found in a library or at one's home should never be cast out due to someone else's opinion	27
21941	4134	Censoring of libraris should be considered, but not at the exspence of knowledge	28
21942	4134	Libraries should not be censored.	29
21943	4137	In the @LOCATION1 @DATE1, there consists of many libraries that are available to the public with an interminable amount of information	0
21944	4137	All of this information gives us many opportunities in life to discover new courses and paths to take	1
21945	4137	Byt what if some of this information has a bad influence in our world	2
21946	4137	What if some of this information changed the persective of peoples' lives, and who people are	3
21947	4137	Libraries do contain offensive and provokative books, movies, and other things that can possibly be hurtful to the behavior standpoint of all human beings	4
21948	4137	Censorship in libraries should be established and set because the people in the @LOCATION1 come from many different places making the @LOCATION1 very diverse	5
21949	4137	One thing in a book @MONTH1 not be offensive to one individual although it could be for someone else	6
21950	4137	Magazines, movies, books, etc	7
21951	4137	should be examined and determined whether it is appropriate for people at certain @CAPS1 whether by building a child section for books and movies and such, or having knowledgable assistance to help what people are looking for	8
21952	4137	Sections in libraries organizes the library providing and easier access to where things are located	9
21953	4137	In libraries, there are search engines to help people find information in a particular location	10
21954	4137	The benefit of having sections divided depending on people's @CAPS1 is that it seperates the mature section from the immature section appose to having both in one	11
21955	4137	Children normally have a seperate section for children books while older and more mature adults or teenagers have a section to gather their important information from	12
21956	4137	An example of a bad situation would be if their was a book located in the childrens section that spoke about drugs and alcohol	13
21957	4137	The children that scrutinized that book would be confused because they do not understand what drugs and alcohol are	14
21958	4137	They could learn bad things about it and children tend to think they are invisible drawing them to try anything or everything that could possibly be life-taking	15
21959	4137	This is common sense	16
21960	4137	Sections in libraries do help establish a sense of organization, although personal assistance would be helpful as well	17
21961	4137	Personal assistance and help on finding information in libraries is very helpful although they must be mature, understand, and know that their are books in libraries that could be about offensive material	18
21962	4137	Asssistance can help us determine if the person that is looking for information about something and there is inappropriate stuff inside the book, the assistant can let the person know about it	19
21963	4137	Because there is an interminable amount of information, I believe that there will be books left on the shelf for many people to learn about	20
21964	4137	Everytime I visit a library, there are always books on the shelves, and when I ask for assistance, they help me find what I am looking for	21
21965	4137	They warn me about offensive or provokative imagery and such and help me with upmost respect	22
21966	4137	Assistance can help prevent any sort of confusion with books, movies, etc	23
21967	4137	Assistants are ready to help people find what they are looking for and warn the people and are knowledgable about the offensive things that are in each book, movie, etc	24
21968	4137	Personally, I believe that freedom of speech comes into play in libraries	25
21969	4137	Writers and authors write about information that is fact or also opinion, and typically people learn about subjects that people enjoy or want to discover	26
21970	4137	Censorship in libraries is necessary to let people know about it, although assistance do not have the right to not let anyone read a particular book because it is inappropriate or provokative	27
21971	4137	Everyone in the @LOCATION1 has the right to read whatevery they please	28
21972	4137	Some measures must take place for example towards minors because otherwise it could lead to issues or disasters, but there should not be a law that prohibits a child from reading something	29
21973	4137	There is no such thing as a book that should be thrown out because every word that comes out out of peoples' mouthes are useful no matter how rediculous it is	30
21974	4137	Even if it is the most rediculous thing you ever heard, that particular person that said something made you think about it and that thought process helped you make a decision in your life that was next to come	31
21975	4137	This would be more on opinion based writing	32
21976	4137	In factual righting, it is something that remains in peoples' heads and is saved into the brain like a word document	33
21977	4137	This document that is saved can be changed and saved again even if the knowledge is offensive	34
21978	4137	Offensive factual information is hurtful to some although it is fact meaning it happened or is true.This brings me to my persepective on the matter that I think there should be a sense of censorship within reason although everyone has the right to read whatever they please because there is a never ending amount of information in the world and that information, including opinion, would make the shelves be empty from books	35
21979	4138	What would you say if your library  was censored	0
21980	4138	Would you believe it would be right to have a censorship at the library	1
21981	4138	Well I am here to explain my belief's on censorship in the library	2
21982	4138	My opinion is that there should be some items being censored, but we dont want to punish everybody just by taking the books off of the shelf completely	3
21983	4138	If i was an adult I would not want my child renting very graphic books, magazines, etc	4
21984	4138	but i wouldn't want to block his whole life	5
21985	4138	There can be different censorship on individual people too	6
21986	4138	An idea is to have a parent come in to decide what type of censorship you can put on a child by putting this on his or her library card	7
21987	4138	The censorship would be a great way to help parents watch what their children are reading and watching	8
21988	4138	A good suggestion for this is what i just brought up, a personal censorship	9
21989	4138	This would keep the child from reading too graphic of novels for their age and it would not offense the parents	10
21990	4138	Also for the rated x magazines, movies, etc	11
21991	4138	i believe they shouldn't be took off the shelf and just moved to a different area that is secluded	12
21992	4138	This can be offensive to parents when they bring their children in, so move it to a place where children cannot have access to this area	13
21993	4138	The censorship on books can also be completely outrageous too	14
21994	4138	Alot of books have graphic parts in them but yet are also a great read and can have great morals to learn	15
21995	4138	Graphic parts of the books are like the graphic parts of our lives, it's going to happen no matter what and we can't get away from it	16
21996	4138	Let the child, teenager, or whoever it is read the book if they are mature enough to read this and don't take it off the shelf	17
21997	4138	Just because it is offensive to some, others want to read the book too	18
21998	4138	You @MONTH1 please some with this idea but you will also anger others with this action	19
21999	4138	Another point to get across is the library is also censored a little bit too	20
22000	4138	The libraries are organized into section by categories of books	21
22001	4138	Some books are categorized by the age level they are intended for	22
22002	4138	Once you get into the actual novels it isnt much like this but for younger ages this is the case, which people can see it work as a censor in ways	23
22003	4138	When you become to the higher reading level, you are most likely going to be old and mature enough to pick what you think is right to read and what is not	24
22004	4138	With all this being said, there really doesnt need much censorship in libraries	25
22005	4138	Unless you have the personal censorship on the younger ones	26
22006	4138	There is no need to punish the ones that did absolutely nothing wrong to the community and to others when all they want to do is to simply check out items at the library	27
22007	4139	Everywhere a person goes, there is always a media source	0
22008	4139	Media can range from newspapers, to magazines, to the radio, and through the television	1
22009	4139	Media is used to inform citizens of occuring events and to provide entertainment	2
22010	4139	Many media materials contain photos, langauge, and etc	3
22011	4139	that can be considered offensive to citizens	4
22012	4139	Media materials should not be taken off the shelf if they are found offensive	5
22013	4139	In the @ORGANIZATION1, citizens have the freedom of speech	6
22014	4139	With censorship, authors, directors, singers and other producers are deprived of this right	7
22015	4139	If the government enforces the censorship law, people can not say what they want to or how they truly feel about a subject	8
22016	4139	Also with censorship, citizens are neglected of their right to watch and listen to what they choose to	9
22017	4139	Not everyone has the same opinion about what should and should not be blocked out of everyday media materials	10
22018	4139	Parents and certain groups have a huge effect on the production of censorship	11
22019	4139	Parents and these groups complain that books, television, and other media materials are offensive and otherwise 'harmful' to their child, and that they should be removed from the media sources	12
22020	4139	I believe that if a parent has a concern with what his/her child is viewing, then they should take matters into their own hands by not letting the child view this material instead of having it censored so the rest of the people can not watch it	13
22021	4139	Parents and certain groups should not have the rest of the world be neglected of their choice to view these certain programs and read certain things	14
22022	4139	Censorship can include anything from photos, to language, to news reports	15
22023	4139	People who believe that offensive material should be blocked out for young viewers and other people do not understand that at some point in a person's life they will encounter these materials	16
22024	4139	Sometimes, in order to understand a major world event, such as the death of @LOCATION2, have to understand the violence and forces that were used	17
22025	4139	If this material is taken offensively, no citizen will truly understand the real story and background of world-wide events	18
22026	4139	Censorship effects everyone, from a small child to a grown adult	19
22027	4139	It can deprive people of certain knowledge and understanding of certain concepts	20
22028	4139	Censorship should not be allowed in the @LOCATION1 and other areas of the world due to the lack of a citizen's freedom of speech and the rights that we as citizens hold	21
22029	4140	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and other thing can be removed from the shelf	0
22030	4140	I believe that when we are cleaning off the shelf that @CAPS1 should be removed from the shelf	1
22031	4140	Other times I don't belive they should be removed form the shelf unless you're cleaning up	2
22032	4140	I'm a @CAPS2	3
22033	4140	I'm always trying to do the right thing	4
22034	4140	And everyday my parents have chores for me to do around the house and I believe that those should be done first insted of doing other things	5
22035	4140	And I think it's crazy to remove books and other things from a shelf unless a shelf a full of books and other things	6
22036	4140	And its something that would have to be done	7
22037	4140	Removing anything from the shelf is not bad	8
22038	4140	But it is not something that had to be done all the time	9
22039	4140	It is something that some people might do	10
22040	4140	It is not my thing	11
22041	4140	I'm always trying to be obedient and have good behavior around others	12
22042	4141	Should a library be able to remove a book or a movie from its shelves if someone happens to find it offensive	0
22043	4141	I believe that the answer to that question should be no, because everyone in the world could find something in a library that could be considered obscene or offensice	1
22044	4141	However, if a library decides to remove every  piece of literature or art in its possession that someone finds offensive, the walls and shelves of its core would be bare	2
22045	4141	I'm sure you have seen and heard many people who have been offended by silly things such as children's novels, pictures in magazines, and song lyrics	3
22046	4141	I know I have seen people who have become livid because of how offeneded a piece of literature or art has made them	4
22047	4141	But with seeing such reactions, I've come to the conclusion that what someone @MONTH1 find offensive, another person could find beautiful	5
22048	4141	For example, paintings of nude men and women are looked at as wrong and disturbing by some and are also seen as masterpieces by others	6
22049	4141	Everyone has their own opinions about things but it's not the library's job to worry about which opinions are wrong or right	7
22050	4141	There is really no way to avoid offending someone without completely clearing the walls and shelves of a library	8
22051	4141	Simply anything could be seen as offensive to anyone	9
22052	4141	I know that I've personally found some books on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be disturbing because of how graffic they are	10
22053	4141	However, that doesn't mean other people shouldn't be able to read something a young woman found offensive	11
22054	4141	Offensive pieces of literature and art are often the best kinds because they evoke emotions in people, although maybe not the intened emotions, and make people think	12
22055	4141	You learn a lot when you're looking at something that has put strong emotions into you	13
22056	4141	With everthing going on in our society and culure today, in the @LOCATION1 and around the world, someone is bound to be offened everyday by something	14
22057	4141	Religious groups @MONTH1 be offened by the way a cover of a book is drawn or the pictures in a teen magazine and politcal leaders @MONTH1 be offended by what journalists are writing about them	15
22058	4141	You see, there is simply no way to avoid offending people	16
22059	4141	To me, it's truly surprising that libraries are still worrying about censorship when television shows are showing sex, drugs, and violence	17
22060	4141	People are obviously getting offened by what television shows are airing but, see, that's just it	18
22061	4141	The television shows are still being aired	19
22062	4141	Offensive or not, people are still watching, just as people are still reading books, looking at pictures, listening to music, that someone, at some point, has found offenseive	20
22063	4141	If a library decides to take out every offensive piece of literature and art what would be left	21
22064	4141	My friends, the answer is nothing	22
22065	4141	A beautiful creation to you @MONTH1 bring back horrific memories to someone else but that doesn't make it a bad creation	23
22066	4141	A novel that makes your stomach turn in knots @MONTH1 teach you more than you've ever learned before in your whole entire life	24
22067	4141	I hope people realize that just because something is offensive to someone doesn't make it wrong	25
22068	4141	Just because someone decided that they thought a piece of literature or art was not what they wanted to see or read doesn't give them the right to deprive someone else of the chance to read or see it	26
22069	4141	As you can clearly see, libraries shouldn't waste their time on censorship, because no matter how hard you try, someone will find something that bothers them.	27
22070	4142	Everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people	0
22071	4142	People do still read or listen to it	1
22072	4142	And the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves	2
22073	4142	I believe that anything offfensive should'nt be censored because it's a way that people can express themselves	3
22074	4142	I listen to music all the time as long a I like the way it sounds	4
22075	4142	It doesn't really matter to me what the lyrics say and im pretty sure that goes for alot of people	5
22076	4142	But there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying	6
22077	4142	I don't really read alot because im picky about the books that I do read	7
22078	4142	That's not the case for everyone though	8
22079	4142	Alot of people like to read because it makes them feel like the book takes them to a different world	9
22080	4142	It's an escape for them from everyday life	10
22081	4142	Which I can understand why someone would want to escape	11
22082	4142	Movies are like books but you get a visual of whats going on	12
22083	4142	Which makes it more entertaining than a book	13
22084	4142	So more people would rather watch a movie	14
22085	4142	But the movies don't have all the details that the book has so the books are more fulfilling	15
22086	4142	And just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who does because there is	16
22087	4142	So my conclusion is that everyone is different they like different things and dislike different things	17
22088	4142	But just because someone doesn't like something doesnt mean that someone else wont like it	18
22089	4142	Like i said everyone is different	19
22090	4142	So why can't the materials they read or watch be different as well?	20
22091	4143	As a teenager I am trying to grow and find my way in life and find ways to express myself	0
22092	4143	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines ect.	1
22093	4143	should be censored in libraries	2
22094	4143	Everyone has their own opinion on things such as the music we listen to or the books we read	3
22095	4143	I do believe that younger children like middle schoolers/preschoolers should be censored from violent songs and movies, but for highschoolers and older I think that it should be our choice	4
22096	4143	I think that if the libraries really believe that a book or magazine is truely offensice they shouldn't allow them to be published	5
22097	4143	Not everyone is going to like every book or every type of music that is out there	6
22098	4143	We should be able to get the books that we like from libraries	7
22099	4143	Like Katherine Paterson said ' And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries are able to remove books music ect.	8
22100	4143	because they believe they are offensive there would be no books left for us to read or songs for us to listen to.I believe that highschoolers and older should be able do decide for themselves what kind of books they read or music they listen to	9
22101	4143	If you dont like a certain type of music dont listen to it, if you dont like the way a book is written, dont read it	10
22102	4143	No one is making you to read or listen to something that you dont want to	11
22103	4143	Books that @MONTH1 be offensive to some @MONTH1 be eye oppening to another	12
22104	4143	In books we learn about war and things that I fing gruesome and unnessisary, but sometimes it is a fact of life and the things we might find offensive in books are usually things that are happening in real life.I do believe that younger children should be censored form books and music that might be offensive, because they are not big enought to know what is right or wrong, and they dont know what to do with violent information in books about war and music with cussing	13
22105	4143	In conclusion, I believe that libraries should only censor books that are found offensice to parents with younger children and in younger sections of libraries.	14
22106	4144	I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves in a library	0
22107	4144	Libraries are meant to provide people with the varities of media that they need	1
22108	4144	This action will pose three things: business loss, inconvenience, and a narrowing of people's book selections	2
22109	4144	The first reason why libraries should not be censored is so they will not lose business	3
22110	4144	Just like any other industry, libraries need people to use their multimedia materials, such as: books, magazines, music, etc	4
22111	4144	so they stay in business	5
22112	4144	The purpose many people go to the library is to get certain magazines, or movies, and so forth, and to get rid of certain movies and/or magazines is getting rid of certain cuatomers	6
22113	4144	Another reason is the loss of business will lead to loss in customers, and if there are no customers to check out multimedia materials, the library will be closed down	7
22114	4144	No one wants their library to be closed, so libraries should not be censored	8
22115	4144	Also, parents, instead of having an entire library censored, censor what  children get from libraries	9
22116	4144	One way is to get the local libraries to participate in putting restrictions on the cards of young children	10
22117	4144	For example, if a thirteen year-old child wants to check-out a movie that is rated @CAPS1 they would not be able to.The restriction on their card could be to rated @CAPS2, or @NUM1 movies	11
22118	4144	Another way is to have an adult monitor what the child gets from the library	12
22119	4144	For example, if a thirteen year-old child wants to get @NUM1 movies,  only allow them to get like one at a time	13
22120	4144	This will lower the risk of offending a parent or guardian	14
22121	4144	Finally, there would be nothing left in the libraries	15
22122	4144	One reason is that out of all the books in the library, i'm sure at least one person is offened by each one	16
22123	4144	Does this mean that every library should close its doors	17
22124	4144	No, of course not, this just means that if something offends someone from their  local library, stay away from it	18
22125	4144	Don't check out that book, movie, magazine, etc	19
22126	4144	A second reason is do not go to that library if the material in it is offensive to people's beliefs or religion	20
22127	4144	Libraries offer many things to help people in enriching their knowledge about a certain belief, so they should not be censored	21
22128	4144	Sometimes what is considered offensive to one person, is essential to another	22
22129	4144	In every book of every library their is something that people most likely think should be censored	23
22130	4144	But they must come to understand that those same books help people tremendously	24
22131	4144	Those same books transform lives, and are read to improve their understanding of something	25
22132	4144	So never will I think that the library should be censored.	26
22133	4145	Freedom to chose is something every person can have, such as what type of clothes you wear	0
22134	4145	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed because everyone should have that right to chose	1
22135	4145	Plus, there are other ways to avoid children getting inappropriate books besides taking the books completely out of the library	2
22136	4145	Censorship in libraries should not happen because if someone is eighteen, they should have the right to chose what they want to watch anyways, the parents can censor what books and movies they want there kids to read and see, and there are offensive things and inappropriate things on television that everyone has access to as well	3
22137	4145	First of all, if a person is eighteen they should have a right to read whatever books they chose because they are grown adults	4
22138	4145	Eighteen year olds can go into rated @CAPS1 movies which would be about as bad as a book most likely	5
22139	4145	In our society, people that are eighteen can do almost whatever they chose because they have freedom	6
22140	4145	For example, adults can look up whatever they chose on the internet, and so can everyone else of all ages	7
22141	4145	So, if they wanted to read a book like that, they could probably get it off the internet, even if they can not in libraries	8
22142	4145	Therefore with today's technologies, censorship would not make a difference	9
22143	4145	Next, there are ways to avoid children reading inappropriate books besides taking the books off the shelves completely	10
22144	4145	For instance, if parents are so worried about their children reading inappropriate books, then they should take their kids to the library themselves and tell their kid what they can and can not read	11
22145	4145	If parents do not censor what their child reads, then those parents @MONTH1 want the child to read whatever he/she choses to	12
22146	4145	If their parents chose to let their kid read the book, then that is their choice, not anybody elses	13
22147	4145	The choice for what book the child reads should be between the parent and the child	14
22148	4145	Lastly, there are so many things in the world that could be offensive to other people besides a book	15
22149	4145	For example, people offend other people all the time by words they say	16
22150	4145	People hear about all of the fighting because the person probably was offended by something someone else said	17
22151	4145	Also there is the television	18
22152	4145	The television has inappropriate shows on it all the time, yet everyone can have access to it if they chose to	19
22153	4145	Plus there are shows on television that could have to do with racism, or someone being overweight	20
22154	4145	These things offend people every day	21
22155	4145	Therefore, we should not take books off the shelves just because there is a possiblity of offending someone, when a person could be offended by so many other things in the world rather than a book	22
22156	4145	In conclusion, the books, magazines, and movies of the library should not be taken off the shelves away from the public just because they are not appropriate for some children	23
22157	4145	Eighteen year olds are adults who should be able to chose whatever they want	24
22158	4145	Plus if parents are worried about their child reading inappropriate books, then they can monitor that themselves	25
22159	4145	Also, people are offended every day by other people, so books, magazines, and movies are not the only things in the world that could be offensive	26
22160	4145	If the person thinks a movie or book is offensive to them, then do not check it out	27
22161	4145	Not everything in our lives has to be controlled by someone, so people should lighten up and give some freedom of choice.	28
22162	4146	These days there are many kinds of merdia in the liberaries beside books	0
22163	4146	There are musics, movies, magazines and many more	1
22164	4146	There are all kind of things and resources that you can find from liberaries	2
22165	4146	Do you think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves it they are found offensive	3
22166	4146	What do you think	4
22167	4146	I think it shouldn't remove	5
22168	4146	Even it is stuff that you don't want children to know, they will know someday	6
22169	4146	Once we remove it from the shelves then more things, the informations are going to removed	7
22170	4146	After all, nothings is going to be leaft	8
22171	4146	There are a lot of imfornation in this world	9
22172	4146	Growing children learn all kind of stuff from parents, book and from other medias	10
22173	4146	Parent want to let their children to learn much as possible	11
22174	4146	However there are sutten things that parent doesn't want the children to learn	12
22175	4146	You need to think this way	13
22176	4146	That children will grow up and become adult, then they will know any way	14
22177	4146	Why would you move from the shelves, if they are going to know about it some how	15
22178	4146	What is a point about it	16
22179	4146	Doesn't removing from the shelves helps children to not know about it	17
22180	4146	I don't think there is a point to do that	18
22181	4146	Katherine Paterson, the Author, said 'All of us can think of a books that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	19
22182	4146	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	20
22183	4146	And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us'	21
22184	4146	I agree with Katherine	22
22185	4146	Once, the books or other mediea get removed because of some reason, other things are going to removed because of other reasons	23
22186	4146	I don't think it should be remove, like Katherine said there are nothing gonna leaft for the children	24
22187	4146	If nothing gonna leaft for the children what is main point of having libaries	25
22188	4146	I believe the certain materials, such as books, music, magazines and many more, should be removed from the shelves it they are found offensive, because children will know and need to know to be adualt	26
22189	4146	Also there is nothing gonna leaft for the children in the libareries	27
22190	4147	Should certaine materials on shelves that are offensive be removed from shelves	0
22191	4147	I believe that certaine materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that are offensive to people should not be removed from shelves	1
22192	4147	These materials are taken in perspective by all different kinds of people	2
22193	4147	Offensive materials should not be taken off of shelves because something that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another person	3
22194	4147	People take things differently than other people might	4
22195	4147	For example, a lady might find a book to be disturbimg or offensive, while the man next to her can find that same book interesting and useful to him	5
22196	4147	Not one person is the same so not everybody will take offense to the same thing	6
22197	4147	I also believe that if someone does not like the object that they are offended by then they do not have to look, purchase, or give attention to that object that is there on the shelve	7
22198	4147	He or she is not forced to buy, read, or watch what is offending them	8
22199	4147	The material that is offending that person is not purposley put there to offend them, it is there for people who are interested in it so that they can enjoy theresleves in whatever it is that they might be doing	9
22200	4147	Therefore I do not think that materials that are offensive should be taken off of shelves	10
22201	4147	People have the right to things that they enjoy	11
22202	4147	A material should not be taken off of a shelve just because one person is offended by it	12
22203	4147	Different people have their own perspective of things and opinion of how things.	13
22204	4148	The thought that Katherine Paterson had in her quote is quite understandable	0
22205	4148	If we were to censor books then there would be nothing to read in libraries	1
22206	4148	If you really tried, in every book you could find something offensive	2
22207	4148	I somewhat agree with her	3
22208	4148	however, I do believe there should be rules on where books are located	4
22209	4148	Books are ment to be read and taking them away would be horrible for every book loving person in this world	5
22210	4148	There are some things about where the books are to be found in the library that is up to dabate	6
22211	4148	Personally, I believe the childrens books should be on the opposite side of the building from the adult books and other reading material	7
22212	4148	In doing this you, for the most part, prevent the children from entering an area that is not age appropriate	8
22213	4148	Teenage reading material should be seperate from both childrens books and adult reading material	9
22214	4148	In this way they are not around the material that is 'above their heads', so to speak	10
22215	4148	If this were done parents' minds could be put at rest for the time being	11
22216	4148	They would not have to worry about their child or teenager finding reading material that is inappropriate or offensive	12
22217	4148	Books that some people find offensive should be catigorized, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2'	13
22218	4148	They should also be catigorized as '@CAPS3', '@CAPS4', or 'Other'	14
22219	4148	In doing this most times where someone would have been offended are prevented from happening	15
22220	4148	Although there will be times where people will still find those books, and @MONTH1 be offended, @CAPS5 is manditory that we do our best to limit those times	16
22221	4148	All necissary precautions should be taken	17
22222	4148	At the same time we should not remove any books from the shelves that are offensive to some	18
22223	4148	In removing a book from a shelf we would be eliminating a piece @CAPS2 or even life long lessons that are difficult to teach without experiencing them yourself	19
22224	4148	Books offer us as humans so much, from @CAPS2 to entertainment to even a form of comfort	20
22225	4148	Books are important to everyone whether they realize @CAPS5 or not	21
22226	4148	We have much to learn from books and we have much to offer our future members of the human race though books	22
22227	4148	I do support Katherine Paterson's belief in that removing books from libraries would destroy the purpose of having them around	23
22228	4148	At the same time I believe there are ways to limit the times where people would be offended by something	24
22229	4148	Removing books would destroy countless years of @CAPS2, past thoughts, and past expeiences	25
22230	4148	Books should never be removed from libraries just because they @MONTH1 be found inappropriate.	26
22231	4149	I don't believe that certain material should be taken out of our libraries	0
22232	4149	If they take the books that people get a learning expresion off of then what does that leave us with	1
22233	4149	Everybody in life should have there own chocies, we shouldn't limit them.It's all about making chocies in life, people should get the right to read the books,magaizes, ect they want, With out people looking down on them or thinking the material they receve is unatural	2
22234	4149	What one person @MONTH1 think is not good read the next person might think the total oppoiste	3
22235	4149	Music is a creative aspest in our world, @CAPS1 person you meet are not the same so @CAPS3 should music be	4
22236	4149	You can't have the same ideas when it's comes to making your creative looks on the music in your community it's not going to turn out the same as everyones elses will	5
22237	4149	If that was the case then the world would be one boreding place to live in	6
22238	4149	I think that @CAPS1 one has there on taste in music	7
22239	4149	If your the right age and your not hurting anybody, Then whats the big problem listing to the music that incourge you to become creative	8
22240	4149	There are alot of movies that some parents might think that they are not good for there kids to watch	9
22241	4149	I think that we shouldn't be so worried about what our kids are watching and more what there doing	10
22242	4149	I think that @CAPS1 movie you watch has a sercet point in it, In other words the lesson learned in the story	11
22243	4149	Some solutions that happen in real life might be on a movie that's probably rated @CAPS2	12
22244	4149	I don't believe that we should be focus on the rating of the movie, We shold be focus on the lesson the movie is teaching you	13
22245	4149	The children in the world are going to have to make there own chocies and what they find intresing, @CAPS3 should we band everything we thinks thats not	14
22246	4149	We need you let the children grow on there own and aslo learn on there own	15
22247	4149	Can't make somebody listen, read or watch what he want them to	16
22248	4149	In conclusion we need to let not just kids but everyone have the chocie there want.The world is changing everyday so we need to change our ideas with it	17
22249	4150	When walking into the library and children are finding books, movies and magazines they should not look at	0
22250	4150	It can be offensive	1
22251	4150	I believe that it is not the authors fault for the offensive language in their work	2
22252	4150	I can understand that parents can get upset if their child is reading a book they should not be looking at	3
22253	4150	My opinion is that students should be able to choose what they want to read and if it is offensive to them they should stop reading the book	4
22254	4150	I feel that the student or adult should know if it is harmful to the student or not	5
22255	4150	Censorship in the library is to find books for everyone to read	6
22256	4150	I think that they should not ban anything in the library because it can be used for something useful to the person	7
22257	4150	I find it hard to believe that libraries will remove every offensive book, movie, or music from shelves because the rating of the item can be horrible	8
22258	4150	I just don't think it should be a good idea for them to ban things from libraries if they need to use the information from the book	9
22259	4150	If it offends them then they should not read the book, and choose another book	10
22260	4150	Authors work too hard for writing their book and go through the publishing process	11
22261	4150	My opinion is a no because I feel they should not remove items off shelves of the libraries because the content of the item is not appropriete to someone	12
22262	4150	My views can vary when I am older and have children of my own someday	13
22263	4150	But as of right now I do not think they should remove items off shelves at libraries	14
22264	4151	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music,movies,magazines, should be removed from from shelves if they are found offensive	0
22265	4151	No i dont believe that certain materials should be removed if found offensive	1
22266	4151	Many kids today are into gang realted activites because they see parents,older siblings, or even friends into so they decide to do the same because they feel its cool	2
22267	4151	Teens now days really dont care the movies, or the music	3
22268	4151	Not all music or movies are offensive	4
22269	4151	So we cant blame that	5
22270	4151	We can only blame ourselves for allowing our children to watch @CAPS1 @CAPS2 movies listen to uncut music	6
22271	4151	We choose that life style for our children so we cant really blame the music and the movies	7
22272	4151	The people who make their uncut music or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 movies dont care who watches it or what affects it would have on children and neither does the parents	8
22273	4151	They're just trying to make a living like everyone else	9
22274	4151	If parents can change they way they raise there children i think the world would be a better place	10
22275	4151	Just because some say that offensive movies, music or even magazines should be removed doesnt mean its there fault	11
22276	4151	Its the parents chose to say its okay if they child should listen to or watch offensive music and movies	12
22277	4152	I certainly don't believe books, magazines, etc.	0
22278	4152	should be taken off the shelves in libraries just because they're offensive to a certain amount of people	1
22279	4152	For one of the reasons are in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 it states that you have the freedom of speech and when you write a book or an article in a magazine you are writing a story on whatever you want and if it is put on a shelf in the @CAPS1 place it should stay there	2
22280	4152	Also, just because it is offensive to one certain group or person doesn't give anybody the right to take something off the shelf in the library because the author is speaking what they want	3
22281	4152	Also in magazines today there are many offensive things to certain people such as celebrities, sports stars, etc..	4
22282	4152	but they don't go to the libraries and take them off the shelf	5
22283	4152	If you were one of those people that did take a book or magazine off the shelf I think you should ask other people what they think about that material, because some people @MONTH1 like it	6
22284	4152	Also if you keep taking all the books off the shelf what will we have to read and educate ourselves about today, and read stories that were told for generations	7
22285	4152	If you do see one of those reading materials and they are offensive to you just put it back up on the shelf	8
22286	4152	and act like you never picked it up.	9
22287	4153	I don't think that certain books or anything should be taken away because people like different stuff	0
22288	4153	Someone might have wanted to get that book	1
22289	4153	I don't think it would be right to take it away	2
22290	4153	When I was in sixth grade, I was in a foster home that I hated	3
22291	4153	They would not let me listen to the music I liked	4
22292	4153	They thought it was bad for kids to listen to	5
22293	4153	All they wanted me to listen to was christian music and I did not like that	6
22294	4153	My old foster parents used to try and take the stuff from me that they thought was the 'devil' in me	7
22295	4153	They would make me read the bible everynight	8
22296	4153	They tried to shove religion down my throat	9
22297	4153	I think maybe that is one reason I am not religious	10
22298	4153	They would not even let me listen to this one band because they had a song out about this girls husband having an affair on her	11
22299	4153	Everyone should have their own opinion and be able to choose what they like or what they listen to or watch	12
22300	4153	When parents are that strict, it usually makes the kids want to do whatever they tell them not to do	13
22301	4153	If you don't let someone watch, listen to, or read what they want, then it might not be very easy for them to express themselves	14
22302	4153	They would not be able to show off what they really like	15
22303	4153	They would be doing something that they don't even like and That is not right	16
22304	4153	Everyone should be able to express themselves and what they like.	17
22305	4154	One of the amendements in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 is freedom of speech, this amendment gives the freedom of speech to anyone who has something to say, as long as what they have to say does not interfere with the @CAPS2 of others	0
22306	4154	It has been long since passed that the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 was signed, but even today there are questions on the subject that still remain	1
22307	4154	should people be allowed to censor books	2
22308	4154	This is a matter that has been disputed throughout the history of humans, and has been the a topic of great contraversy for many years	3
22309	4154	Some say that one should have the right to censor a book that they find offensive	4
22310	4154	However, if one would take the time to think on the issue they @MONTH1 see that if everyone had the right to censor a book that they dispised, there would not be any books left in the world	5
22311	4154	In a population that contains so many different cultures and ethinicities, and reaches to almost every corner of the @LOCATION1, writing a book that everyone could enjoy and not find offensive could be an impossible task	6
22312	4154	We on @LOCATION1 live in a very diverse society, and liturature has, over the decades and centuries, adapted to the different types of customs, cultures, and religions so that anyone can find a book that they enjoy	7
22313	4154	The way of life that one lives @MONTH1 be different from that of others, but one should respect and accept the different ways of living, just as liturature has	8
22314	4154	It is like being in school, there has many times been that one student that the rest of the class see as really different	9
22315	4154	Our teachers taught us to be nice and accept that student for who they were and that not everyone is the same	10
22316	4154	Even after this and many other articles have been written about the topic, it will still remain a topic of much debate	11
22317	4154	This is becuase everyone is different, and has their own opinions	12
22318	4154	Some say it is a great idea, and others say everyone is entitled to their own ways of living	13
22319	4154	However the issue will go on, because after all we are all different and have our own opinions.	14
22320	4156	I think other materials in libraries such as music and art should stay active in public libraries or school libraries	0
22321	4156	They show symbolic meaning to the ever changing world as we know it	1
22322	4156	People have different beliefs about anything, I don't care what you say everybody still has a different opinion about anything and everything	2
22323	4156	So just keep believing what you want to believe that's fine, but don't ruin it for others, you ever heard the saying, '' if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all'', well they should remember that saying and stick to it.In my years of being in school nobody has protested about certain reading materials in public libraries because everyone read what they liked because the library supplied people with the material they wanted to read	3
22324	4156	Let's say a person wanted to read a book about the fall of the wall of @LOCATION1, the library says they do not and will not carry such reading history, the person will be angry even though they can find the book somewhere else but they should still be able to find that book in that library	4
22325	4156	That is history in this world and they should know it	5
22326	4156	That compares with people wanting to destroy history made in this world, history people risk there lives for to be recognized in this world, this compares with the topic fully	6
22327	4156	I hope that this essay will give the protesters a second thought on the topic they are bickering about	7
22328	4156	That will be all	8
22329	4157	I believe that libraries should not censor their literature, all of our media is a fountain of knowledge waiting to be discovered	0
22330	4157	No one should be able to decide what is appropriate for the public to know	1
22331	4157	The right to decide what is and is not appropriate for us should not be decided by libraries	2
22332	4157	That right should remain with every single person, so they can decide whats right for them	3
22333	4157	Over the last thousands and thousands of years media has grown at an incredible rate through books, music, movies, and magazines	4
22334	4157	With all of this media we have learned many things that we use today from past trials and failures	5
22335	4157	Media is something that always is around and reminds us of our past mistakes, to ensure that they don't happen again	6
22336	4157	The great thing about all of the media we have today is that we haven't even learned everything that we can and will from it	7
22337	4157	Some of our media @MONTH1 not be the most appropriate things ever, but we can still learn so much from it	8
22338	4157	It @MONTH1 make some people upset and if it does then they should stay away from it	9
22339	4157	It is not right to get rid of certain parts of media because what one person @MONTH1 find immoral and wrong someone else @MONTH1 be able to learn from it some how	10
22340	4157	If you are offended by some of the material thing you should avoid it, not get rid of it for everyone	11
22341	4157	Our media is very powerful and should not be censored	12
22342	4157	Media has an unbelieveable impact on the world, so we should not try to hide some of it	13
22343	4157	We have not even seen half of what media can do	14
22344	4158	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
22345	4158	No, it should not be removed	1
22346	4158	Katherine says, ' I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor.' @CAPS1 of all, she can have the right to do that but there is people who have a say in this	2
22347	4158	There are people who can read, listen, watch, and see what they like	3
22348	4158	Definately, I really think that it should not be removed even though it doesn't have positive things	4
22349	4158	Although, it might offend some people they have a choice whether they should see, watch, listen, and read it	5
22350	4158	Many people might agree with the author about what she thinks about this	6
22351	4158	Though, many people might go against it	7
22352	4158	One reason why I think that people should be allowed to see, watch, listen, and read whatever they would like to see, it's because it's their own choice	8
22353	4158	We make our own decisions whether people like it or not	9
22354	4158	Another reason would be because people would want to see the funny things that people invent that actually make the shows	10
22355	4158	Some people do not like to be bored of the same thing	11
22356	4158	Katherine Paterson the Author, is right in some ways	12
22357	4158	She wouldn't want her children to see things that are inappropriate	13
22358	4158	I have a daughter and I wouldn't want her to see things that are abhor	14
22359	4158	Last reason would be children should not allowed to see inappropriate things until they are eighteen or older	15
22360	4158	These things can influence children very intensely	16
22361	4158	Indeed, many people in this world are influenced with bad things	17
22362	4158	The author stated, 'then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' Right, she is meaning that we have a choice of what our children would like to see	18
22363	4158	For example, there is a magazines full of negative words and full of horrid stuff	19
22364	4158	Would you pull it out of the shelf for your child to not have a chance to see that	20
22365	4158	You should if you love your child even though it's your own choice	21
22366	4158	You would want the best for you child to not see, read, watch, and listen to things that are inappropriate	22
22367	4158	In conclusion, this would be your choice	23
22368	4158	There will always be things in the world that you don't like	24
22369	4158	You cannot stop the terrible things from happening	25
22370	4158	In the libraries there shouldn't be anything negative anyway because you never know what your child might be doing	26
22371	4158	Simply, teach your kid what is wrong and right	27
22372	4158	Finally, from what you experienced	28
22373	4158	Teach them the right things from the wrong things you learned so they wouldn't do the same mistake as you did.	29
22374	4159	I believe that all types of books should be available to all types of people	0
22375	4159	A library should never be intended for a certain group of readers	1
22376	4159	As far as I'm concerned, books are creativity in text-form	2
22377	4159	Creativity is a large part of life, and without it, we would all be the same	3
22378	4159	There is at least one book for every person in the world, and whether reading is a hobby or not does not matter, there is a book that will interest you	4
22379	4159	It is not fair to everybody to take books off the shelves of a library due to 'offensive' content	5
22380	4159	With different personalities comes different writers	6
22381	4159	With different writers comes different books	7
22382	4159	With different books comes different readers	8
22383	4159	There are a lot of people out there who like to read	9
22384	4159	What are the people who @MONTH1 like 'offensive' content going to do when these books are taken off the shelves	10
22385	4159	Books are written for two reasons: allowing authors to express themselves and giving readers the chance to explore and relate to the imaginations of authors	11
22386	4159	I think that if a writer has the ability to put whatever he/she wants in a book, that book should be available to anyone and everyone.	12
22387	4160	Have you ever been to a library and found a book offensive?In my opinion I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are at the library for a reason	0
22388	4160	The reason being say if we wanted to check out a movie and everywhere else was to expensive to get it, why wouldn't you just get it at the library if they had it	1
22389	4160	Most libraries that I've gone to have certain sections for adults and children	2
22390	4160	That means there would be appropiate things for little children to read in the section that they have been given	3
22391	4160	If children under age were to wander off into the adult section that would be their fault if they saw something unapproiate not the libraries	4
22392	4160	If the case was if every time a child or someone under age took a book offensive, I belive that the libraries wouldn't have as much of books in their buildinds that grown ups would like to read	5
22393	4160	Of course I'm not trying to say that there should be extermely unappropriate books wandering around in the library that the small children should see	6
22394	4160	I'm just saying that the adults do have the right to have books that they would be interested in.When I've gone to the libraries I have found books that I have enjoyed reading and I'm not the type of person that would just grab a book and be interested in right away	7
22395	4160	There are books, movies, magazines, and music that have strange titles that some people might take offensive to, but those are the ones that get read more or listend to more or watched more	8
22396	4160	I believe that no material should be taken off of the shelf just because one person found it offensive	9
22397	4160	If the person doesn't like the idea of the people in the library not taking the material off	10
22398	4160	it's the person personal problem I think	11
22399	4160	For example there is this book called '@CAPS1' and it's about a teenager who got into drugs real bad and got pregnate at a young age	12
22400	4160	That book was one of the best selling books in the world	13
22401	4160	If somebody took that offensive and asked for the book to be removed then it's their loss	14
22402	4160	I mean if there were a book about how to murder somebody then yeah I would ask for that material to be taken off the shelf immeditely	15
22403	4160	Except no library in this entire world would have that kind of stuff up so why worry about it.If there were ever to be that type of situation then that would be bizzare.But I highly doubt that it would come to a point like in time	16
22404	4160	So in conclusion that is my opinion on this	17
22405	4161	Offensive material shouldn't be taken off the shelves at all	0
22406	4161	Books are written on various of topics from love to sci-fi	1
22407	4161	Everyone is offended by something	2
22408	4161	if all of us could remove a book that we precieve as offensive then the human race wouldn't read anymore	3
22409	4161	@PERSON1 had to demonstrate this in a similar aspect to congress concerning his music lyrics	4
22410	4161	@PERSON1 is the reason why there is an '@CAPS1' sticker on @CAPS2's that contain offensive lyrics	5
22411	4161	Books SHOULD @CAPS3 be censored at all	6
22412	4161	It hides the authors thoughts, idea, and meanings behind their writing	7
22413	4161	I've read hundreds of books from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1	8
22414	4161	The aspect that a parent is worried about what their children might read implies parents need to step in	9
22415	4161	Having an one-on-one talk about the books context with their child could solve this uneasiness parents have about books	10
22416	4161	Pre-@CAPS4 to @CAPS5 to @CAPS6 requires many stages of growing physically and menatally	11
22417	4161	Through those phases kids learn from various sources including negative ones	12
22418	4161	It's up to the parents to ensure that tomorrow's generation can depict what is truthful and what is false	13
22419	4161	My grandmother shared a memory about when I was @LOCATION1 learning to read	14
22420	4161	I was reading out of a @CAPS7 magazine	15
22421	4161	yes the magazine is intended for adults but I obtained the skill to read from it	16
22422	4161	A skill that will propell me into job oppertunities and assist me in everyday life.	17
22423	4162	Throughout the years, many events have taken place in our history	0
22424	4162	Throughout these times the events have been recorded, journaled, and filmed	1
22425	4162	These thoughts, opinions, and facts @MONTH1 be offensive to a select few in our @CAPS2	2
22426	4162	The question is, 'Should our libraries take these 'offensive' pieces off the shelves?' The simple answer to this highly disputed question is no	3
22427	4162	Censoring our libraries would be a harmful and wrong thing to do to the general public	4
22428	4162	Censoring our libraries creates an illusion of a perfect @CAPS2	5
22429	4162	If libraries were filled with tasteless articles and perfect fairyland books the library would become a place where reality is not present	6
22430	4162	Libraries hold information that is raw and true without leaving the facts behind	7
22431	4162	People need to get a taste of reality in order to survive in the 'real @CAPS2' and one of the greatest ways to abtain this knowledge is through books	8
22432	4162	Being exposed to offensive material and different viewpoints helps shape ourselves into who we are or will become	9
22433	4162	To take this away would be harming our development and growth, thus creating an 'imperfect' @CAPS2	10
22434	4162	Certain points in history are not something that everyone can be proud of	11
22435	4162	The @CAPS1, @LOCATION1's genocide, and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 are all devastating points in time that can be a touchy subject to one and few people	12
22436	4162	However, history is an important factor in everyones lives	13
22437	4162	we know history in order to not repeat it	14
22438	4162	Losing this information is way for people to not be clearly informed, harming the future outcome of our society	15
22439	4162	Without public records of these happenings, it can cause confusion and misconcepted views of important topics	16
22440	4162	If we censor all the media from libraries across the nation, ordinary people, such as yourself, would be 'living in the dark.'     As people develop their own opinions and views overtime they begin to distinguish the difference between right and wrong	17
22441	4162	Your rights @MONTH1 be someone else's wrongs	18
22442	4162	What @MONTH1 be offensive to you, @MONTH1 not be offensive to the person sitting next to you	19
22443	4162	Quoted by the author Katherine Paterson, '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	20
22444	4162	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In truth, by removing offensive material from our bookshelves there would be no media left	21
22445	4162	Not everyone will have the same opinion on matters that hold importance, but that is why the @CAPS2 goes around	22
22446	4162	We as a society have the right to guard our ability to share opinions, censorship destroys our ability to do so	23
22447	4162	Everyone is different	24
22448	4162	The @CAPS2 is full of diversity and viewpoints that are bursting with interesting concepts	25
22449	4162	By censoring records of history, opinion, observations, our @CAPS2 becomes an illusion	26
22450	4162	We need to have these facts available to the general public	27
22451	4162	By ridding ourselves of 'offensive' media we cannot share our opinions with one another for a more successful @CAPS2	28
22452	4162	Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it is harmul to our growth as a society and is overall the wrong thing to do	29
22453	4163	There a books, music, movies, magazines, and etc	0
22454	4163	that are not appropriate for children	1
22455	4163	Having them banned from shelves shouldnt even be a question, if children shouldnt read, watch, or listen to it then its the parents responsibility to make sure they dont	2
22456	4163	I dont think they should take those kind of books, movies, or music off the shelves because what about teens that like them or grown ups also	3
22457	4163	There just gonna take them down for the children but lose buisiness from grown ups and teens	4
22458	4163	That doesnt make any sence at all	5
22459	4163	I think either the child should know what he or she can read, watch, or listen too, and if they cant then its up to the parent or a grown up around them to let them know what they can choose	6
22460	4163	A way to solve the problem can be seperate those offensive books, music, or movies from ones that are appropriate for children	7
22461	4163	That would make everything alot easier so nothing comes off the shelves and knowone loses buissiness.	8
22462	4164	I go to the libbrary every @DATE1 of every week	0
22463	4164	Although I don't really read that much	1
22464	4164	I usualy get movies or music	2
22465	4164	If I do get a book to read its usualy a magazine or something for school	3
22466	4164	I don't think that books should be removed	4
22467	4164	If you don't read them it doesent mean that other people don't	5
22468	4164	If you don't like the book just ignore it and go on its simple as that	6
22469	4164	For instens if I found a book about @CAPS1 or about the @CAPS2 fathe I would not read it for my self but I would not take it down off of the shelf	7
22470	4164	Other people might want to read it	8
22471	4164	It's there choice to read it not mine	9
22472	4164	It's like the radio know	10
22473	4164	The radio plays songs and cuts out the curis words	11
22474	4164	I don't think that they should do that because it messies up the songs lyrics and it is going aginst the artists words	12
22475	4164	The artist sings the song but people chang his or her words	13
22476	4164	To me I don't think thats right	14
22477	4164	It's also like telivtion now	15
22478	4164	You see the movie in theaters or on @CAPS3 and they have bad language or bad seens in them	16
22479	4164	When you watch that same movie on telivtion they take out about @NUM1 minuts of the movie because of th bad seen or they cut out the languge	17
22480	4164	To me I think every thing should stay	18
22481	4164	I think if you don't want your kids to see it just block it but don't cut out parts from the movie it's not fair to the other people	19
22482	4164	If people don't like some music then just swich the radio station to another area on the radio	20
22483	4164	Theres no need to take the words out	21
22484	4164	Kids are going to pick the words up in school or off the streets any way	22
22485	4164	I also think seence we are having to pay so much taxes I think we should get the privilage to come home and watch movies on telivtion and relax	23
22486	4165	It is important to know what is going on or what has gone on in the world	0
22487	4165	If @CAPS1 is unaware, problems can only be helped to a short extent	1
22488	4165	There is a point in which words can turn into harrassment, but the boundaries before reaching that point can be fairly defended by the freedom of speech	2
22489	4165	@CAPS1 must learn in order to teach	3
22490	4165	@CAPS1 must teach for others to learn	4
22491	4165	Censorship in libraries is more offensive than the material that is hidden.Censorship should be prohibited because knowledge and time is all we have and everyone must receive and give respect	5
22492	4165	If @CAPS1 were to look up information about the government on the internet, that person would not find a lot of useful information	6
22493	4165	It is a challenge to find why same-sex marriage is illegal in some areas or if the words on the news are true	7
22494	4165	In this generation, our species relies on cellphones, websites with recent dates, and the news	8
22495	4165	It seems that the time of research is diminishing	9
22496	4165	@CAPS1 can only learn so much from a world history textbook	10
22497	4165	It @MONTH1 not be completely accurate	11
22498	4165	The passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone	12
22499	4165	With such a high risk of being mislead, the world needs as much information and thought as it can get	13
22500	4165	Knowledge, no matter the content, is valuable	14
22501	4165	It can help @CAPS1 to learn from mistakes and solve problems	15
22502	4165	The world cannot afford to censor	16
22503	4165	Censorship does not change the existence of that censored author's thoughts or the reality of what has occurred	17
22504	4165	The hidden information could be helpful	18
22505	4165	As this essay is being read, people are dying	19
22506	4165	It can easily be counted: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3	20
22507	4165	They are gone	21
22508	4165	At any moment, anyone and everyone could die	22
22509	4165	Time is mainly all we have	23
22510	4165	We need knowledge to make the most out of it	24
22511	4165	Everyone deserves to be heard	25
22512	4165	If @CAPS1 were to refrain from listening when being spoken to, it would be disrespectful and offensive to the speaker	26
22513	4165	A lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard	27
22514	4165	Such cries make the more fortunate, well-fed, and housed people such as myself uncomfortable	28
22515	4165	Despite such discomfort, this information should not be hidden from anyone	29
22516	4165	No matter how uncomfortable or offensive a material @MONTH1 be, perhaps the author is simply thinking for himself/herself	30
22517	4165	Perhaps the author does not find it offensive, and is simply trying to make sense of the world because that is all @CAPS1 can do with all of the problems that exist	31
22518	4165	Every single person has the right to be heard	32
22519	4165	The people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others	33
22520	4165	There is no absolute, divine being that can accurately judge a material	34
22521	4165	The people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material	35
22522	4165	Because of the great variety of opinions and concept of respect, everyone must be heard	36
22523	4165	Censorship should not be allowed because time and knowledge are the valuable building blocks that determine the future of humanity and not a single thought should go unheard	37
22524	4165	Censorship is a great hindrance to knowing what is occurring and what has occurred in the world	38
22525	4165	Truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth	39
22526	4165	It is up to the world to unleash it and make something out of it.	40
22527	4166	People will always take things offensive	0
22528	4166	It is a fact of life	1
22529	4166	No one will ever be completly satisified no matter what	2
22530	4166	We can not try to please everyone, but it will never happen	3
22531	4166	We have a freedom of speech even if those words are offensive to others	4
22532	4166	Things on the internet are offensive and no one can mandate how it is veiwed either	5
22533	4166	The same should go for a library	6
22534	4166	I understand a parent's concern with their child reading or listening to things that are not appropriate	7
22535	4166	Some of the things authors write can be either innapproraite or offensive	8
22536	4166	That is their freedom of speech	9
22537	4166	We can not take that away from them but there should be some censorship at least to the apprearance of books	10
22538	4166	For music and movies they usually have a warning lable if it is not intended for younger kids	11
22539	4166	It might be a good idea for some libraries to do the same with books and magazines	12
22540	4166	In order to see a rated, '@CAPS1', movie you have to be over @NUM1 and for a good reason because of the mature content	13
22541	4166	The books being writen now are more and more mature	14
22542	4166	But if we take on the custom of being of certain age for books we might invaid the privacy of others	15
22543	4166	No one has the right to remove books from a library's shelf on the count of being offensive	16
22544	4166	Who can judge whether something is offensive	17
22545	4166	The libraries are publicly owened and therefore have no one owner	18
22546	4166	The city owns them	19
22547	4166	If there is a problem with whether a book should be at the library it is the city's decision	20
22548	4166	Even if there is such an uproar about one book, unless the decision is unnanimous, no book should be taken off the shelves	21
22549	4166	The book should simply be put in a spot either behind the counter or where it is available only on request	22
22550	4166	Taking books off the shelves I beleive is taking away from the public's ability to read	23
22551	4166	If a parent is concerned about what their child might read, they should confront their local librarian	24
22552	4166	The librarian @MONTH1 be able to help them retrieve books that are appropriate and apealing to their child.	25
22553	4167	There are alot of things that people think do do we really think that things that are found offensive in the libraries should be tooken down	0
22554	4167	I think that if there is somthimg foumd offincive in a library, it should be tooken down immediatley	1
22555	4167	Libraries should be a place of comfort, a place to relax, a place to read and enjoy our books not a place were if we find somthing disturbing or offensive we shouldnt come there any more	2
22556	4167	Some people might not care about the things they see and some do	3
22557	4167	Therefore if i see somthing that offends me and is disturbing to me i will ask nicely if it could be removed from the list and book files	4
22558	4167	Now to sum it all up if a book or whatever it @MONTH1 be offends you in the library, then i believe it should be removed from that library	5
22559	4167	If people find things less attracctive and offensive it will soon go around and less people will come to that library	6
22560	4167	This is how i put it, make the library suitable for others, make them feel at home when they are reading there book, magazine, etc., not for you	7
22561	4167	It is how others think about what is out there in these libraries not what you think	8
22562	4168	This is a very difficult topic to argue with	0
22563	4168	In my opinion I believe that there should be certian types of censorship in the libraries	1
22564	4168	Eventually everyone is going to be exposed to the type of material in some of these books and etc	2
22565	4168	This material should be allowed in public libraries and highschool libraries, but of course you wouldn' want to see a highschool level of maturity in an elementary library	3
22566	4168	Highschool students are more than likely to be exposed to inapropriate music and magazines than younger children	4
22567	4168	If they would like to listen to music that has inapropriate language then they should be allowed to	5
22568	4168	If there are young kids doing this it is obviously a bad thing because it is teaching them wrong things early in there life	6
22569	4168	It is even best if they arn't exposed to this at all	7
22570	4168	There are also certian books in this world that are inapropriate to even highschool students and they need to stay out of all libraries so that there is no exposure	8
22571	4168	Once they are old enough to make their own choices then that is their decision on wether or not they want to look at those books	9
22572	4168	There are some things that can and can't be put out into liraries	10
22573	4168	Even you should know what belongs or doesn't	11
22574	4168	So as I come to my conclusion, there should be things like music, books, and magazines but leave out the graphic material, children don't need to see that kind of stuff	12
22575	4168	It is all your own choice of things you want to read	13
22576	4168	Just make it the right choice, and understand what your reading, watchin, listening to, or being around.	14
22577	4169	Teachers in schools do their best to make sure the material that children and young adults read and see in school is appropriate for their certain age group	0
22578	4169	Parents also make the effort to censor what their kids read, watch, and listen to as a way of keeping them innocent	1
22579	4169	At a point in a young adults life, this feeling of censorship wears off, and the teenager decides to read, watch, and listen to whatever they want to	2
22580	4169	This is how it goes in most cases, but is this strong feeling of public censorship too old fashioned for todays society	3
22581	4169	In my opinion, yes	4
22582	4169	Censorship, to a certain extent, should not be in present in libraries	5
22583	4169	There will always be something that one person finds in appropriate while another finds it to be perfectly fine	6
22584	4169	When I was younger we would sometimes watch movies in the after school program I attended	7
22585	4169	One movie, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 specifically, created conflict	8
22586	4169	While my mother was fine with me watching the movie, some of the other kids were not allowed to because their parents did not find the movie appropriate	9
22587	4169	Because of this one parent family all the kids in the program had to watch a differnt movie that everyone's parents were okay with	10
22588	4169	As @PERSON1 said eventually 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries restricted material based on what people found offensive, there would be nothing left	11
22589	4169	people can find offensive material in almost any material in this century	12
22590	4169	It is the way our culture is	13
22591	4169	I am not saying it is right, but someone else might think so and that person has a right to go to a library and get a book that they find perfectly fine	14
22592	4169	In the @ORGANIZATION1 censorship has almost never been present	15
22593	4169	It is part of what is great about this country	16
22594	4169	People can speak, believe, and read what they want without the government interfering	17
22595	4169	This is not true in a lot of places and we should value that as @CAPS3, not complain about it	18
22596	4169	The government has no right constitutionally to censor material put in public, there can be age restrictions, but to completely cut the material out would go against this countrie's policy of freedom	19
22597	4169	I agree that age restrictions are okay, but I believe it is untimately up to the parents of a child what they want their child to watch or read	20
22598	4169	Overall, the censorship issue is a little bit of a grey area	21
22599	4169	In my opinion our country is about freedom and censorship is not exactly upholding the constitution	22
22600	4169	People can believe what they want, but the issue will be hard to conclude	23
22601	4169	Everyone has a different view on something, that is what started this issue in the first place	24
22602	4169	When everyone learns to get along, maybe then can this problem be solved	25
22603	4170	Today's books in are libraries are sometimes offensive	0
22604	4170	Yes, I know they are about thing that happen in history	1
22605	4170	Other books are not, some more than others	2
22606	4170	They are about killing, shooting, doing drugs,ect	3
22607	4170	First, I don't want my children growing up thinking @CAPS2 okay to steal, do drugs, or anything of that sort	4
22608	4170	I'v seen books that have no meaning at all that should be in are libraries	5
22609	4170	The kids might think they are good books to read, I think other wise	6
22610	4170	Books that fourth graders read that have bad words in them	7
22611	4170	Secondly, @CAPS1 are fun to read, i know they are	8
22612	4170	You have to look at it this way im of age to read those kind of books but, letting little kids read those books is not okay with me or other people	9
22613	4170	If it where up to me i would take some of the really bad books, music, movies, and magazines out	10
22614	4170	@CAPS2 not up to me, it takes more than one person to do that	11
22615	4170	It would'n be fair if it was all up to me because the person next to me might not think the way  i am	12
22616	4170	Next, @CAPS2 okay to take a movie and watch it or even ask for some music to lesson to	13
22617	4170	As long as @CAPS2 okay to watch or lesson to	14
22618	4170	Im just saying what i think would be right	15
22619	4170	Not everone think's the same	16
22620	4170	People @CAPS3 @CAPS1 kids watch, and lesson to all kinds of music and movies	17
22621	4170	As long as @CAPS2 okay with the perant it should be okay	18
22622	4170	Lastly, @CAPS3 kids be kids	19
22623	4170	Have them grow up the way they want to grow up	20
22624	4170	Yes, that might sound dumb to the next person but it sounds okay with me	21
22625	4170	At the end of the day you still get to teach them not to lesson or do that kind of stuff in the books.	22
22626	4171	Today in our society many things can be taken in many different way	0
22627	4171	Many sayings, quotes and even just simple words are twisted, turned, and made into something they are not	1
22628	4171	The author Katherine Paterson once said that a person has a right to remove harmful things that explicit for children from a shelf, and this is true	2
22629	4171	Even with that being true, the question truly is, will it do you any good to take those things away	3
22630	4171	In my opinion offensive materials should not be removed because a librarian could be taking away material someone without money wanted, children--espcially teens--will almost do anything for what they want, and things have a double meaning most of the time	4
22631	4171	If a librarian finds something offensive, he or she @MONTH1 not ever put that book on the shelf in fear of children finding the material	5
22632	4171	I think that action the librarian takes is completely unnecessary	6
22633	4171	He or she @MONTH1 be able to take that privelege away from his or her own library, but the material is still out there in the world	7
22634	4171	A child can simply go to another library, or even a store to find the same thing	8
22635	4171	I also believe that a library should leave the book on the shelf because what if an adult wants to read the book but does not have the opportunity to read it because it is found offensive	9
22636	4171	Being a teenager myself, I have seen what lengths some people will go to just so they can get this explicit material	10
22637	4171	If a teen goes to a library and can not find what they want at that location, they will simply move on to another location	11
22638	4171	In even the most extreme cases, a teen will take their parent's credit card and purchase the item they desire online	12
22639	4171	In this case it would seem as if the library not having one thing because of something offensive, could cause a big catastrophe	13
22640	4171	When a person listens to music, or reads a book, that person could take something differently from how the writer intended it to be	14
22641	4171	For example a person could take up a funny book that is finding funny things in everyone, but the reader could end up thinking the author was only making fun of one specific thing	15
22642	4171	something that reader could be involved in	16
22643	4171	Most songs nowadays have an excessive use of fowl language, but even then that language is not intended to be taken in the way some people take it	17
22644	4171	Everything in life can have a double meaning, which makes it easier to find offensive material	18
22645	4171	These select few reasons are why censorship in libraries is unesscesary	19
22646	4171	The responsibility should not be put on the librarians, but on the parents if a librarian is concerned about a child finding unacceptable material	20
22647	4171	If the librarian does not like the material then he or she should not listen to or read it	21
22648	4171	however, that librarian should not take the privelege to listen to or read the material from other people	22
22649	4171	Katherine Paterson once said you can hope for a child not to find the material, and you can take it away, but then there is nothing left for the rest of the people	23
22650	4171	With this it shows that a person can not let one small thing ruin something for everyone else	24
22651	4172	The idea of censoring books and music in our libraries has long been debated	0
22652	4172	Libraries are places that people can go to stray away from the norm and get lost in the works of other authors and musicians	1
22653	4172	I believe that reading and the ability to express oneself through the powers of music is a very essential part of our lives	2
22654	4172	Censoring these would only shelter our lives and keep younger generations from discovering the effect that words have on our emotions and actions from day to day	3
22655	4172	Books are one of the oldest forms of information we've had throughout the years	4
22656	4172	I think that if someone were to remove a piece of information that they found offensive it would only open the door to other people to find excuses to keep the hard work of authors behind closed doors	5
22657	4172	Personally i enjoy reading	6
22658	4172	I think that with every book i read it opens the door to other beliefs and culturs that i would otherwise never learn about	7
22659	4172	Children need to be able to explore the world, to get to know how other civilizations grow and function as to how we in the @LOCATION1 function in our own little world that is getting more and more judgemental every day	8
22660	4172	The only way to do this is to pick up a book from someone who has been lucky enough to experience it themselves	9
22661	4172	I have always had a deep passion for music	10
22662	4172	When i want to relax music helps me to center myself and open my mind	11
22663	4172	In my opinion, censoring music shouldn't be something that people even consider	12
22664	4172	Removing music from libraries is difficult for me to even begin to try and accept	13
22665	4172	Freedom of speech was once a huge part of our country	14
22666	4172	Now it seems as if everything we've been taught of our great @LOCATION2 has been nothing more than just a false cover to let the government control how we live, act, and now how we choose to express ourselves	15
22667	4172	Music is a freeing way to express oneself in a not so violent way	16
22668	4172	During the sixties and seventies, music was the way alot of people protested things like war and racism without being violent	17
22669	4172	Times have changed though and the people in charge of our country no longer see it as an 'appropriate' option	18
22670	4172	I belive that just because one society believes something to be inappropriate, doesn't mean that it actually is that way	19
22671	4172	We worry enough already about what other people think, why try to judge others' work if we can't accept the fact that we are all different	20
22672	4172	If we all accepted the differences in our world's cultures, there wouldn't have to be a debate on whether or not to censor an expressive and emotional piece of art that deserves to be shown in our libraries	21
22673	4173	Can you believe that some people think that books should be banned for having bad things in them	0
22674	4173	Well I can, Children today are learning nothing but violence and cursing these days	1
22675	4173	Banned books could be the way we set them stait and make them recognise that stuff is bad	2
22676	4173	Only a handfull of kids these days are choosing to read books, a majority of them are playing video games and watching tv	3
22677	4173	Chilren shouldn't be alloud to swear, or think that violence is alright	4
22678	4173	Chilren will read these bad books and think it is ok to shoot someone if they are doing something they don't like, but it's not alright	5
22679	4173	Banned books are exaclty what children need when they are in their younger years	6
22680	4173	Banned books might have foul language and violence, but I believe that it is ok to let your teen or young adault read them if they are mature enough to handle it	7
22681	4173	Teenagers should be mature enough to be able to read a book with a few swear words in it, or someone killing another person	8
22682	4173	Some banned books don't even have swear words in them	9
22683	4173	'@CAPS1 @CAPS2' doesn't have one swear word in any of the books but still it remains on the banned books list to this day	10
22684	4173	Some books, movies, magazines, etc	11
22685	4173	should be removed for profanity and drugs	12
22686	4173	I do believe that someone is trying to make a difference with the banned books list	13
22687	4173	Censorship should only be used if a person is too young to understand why or what is happening when they say a bad word or do something confusing	14
22688	4173	In conclusion I think censorship is a great thing that should be used moderatly	15
22689	4173	The children today dont need to be learning about sex, drugs, swearing, violence, etc	16
22690	4173	I do believe if they put an age limit on what you can watch/read that it will be a more controlled topic to talk about.	17
22691	4174	I feel that censorship in libraries is not needed	0
22692	4174	There are ways around your child having to be subjected to certain things you don't want them to be subjected to	1
22693	4174	If you don't want your child to witness certain types of material that is on you, not the libraries	2
22694	4174	We have libraries for the sole purpose of variety what is the point in having a library if you can't find what you want because it has offended someone	3
22695	4174	There are ways around completely taking certain things off the shelf if they are that explicet then they can be put in a section just for adults	4
22696	4174	No I do not belive certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	5
22697	4174	One reason why it is not necessary to take certain things off the shelf is if you don't want your child to read or see certain things okay that's fine then watch them and see what they try to pick up and read or watch	6
22698	4174	Your child doesn't have to anything if you don't want them to	7
22699	4174	It's like saying I don't like this telivision show I never want my child to see it well what are the odds that telivision show is going to stop playing just becase your not happy with the violents,drug use,language, ect	8
22700	4174	The odds are extremely unlikely	9
22701	4174	When you don't want you child to see that certain show what do you do you watch them and keep them from watrching it so why should there be any differance when it comes to the books they are subjected to in a library	10
22702	4174	Another reason would be the sole purpose of a libray is to give variety  to the people a place where there is something for everyone	11
22703	4174	Just because you think something is horrible and no one should read, hear, or see doesn't mean that some one else won't like it, it could be someone else's favorite book,magazine,cd, or movie	12
22704	4174	One oppinion shouldn't count for so much	13
22705	4174	If you don't like a book,movie,magazine, cd or agree with the content fine your entitled to your own oppinion then don't check it out no one is making you	14
22706	4174	If they took something off the self everytime they got a complaint about it there would be nothing left	15
22707	4174	If they were about to try and accomidate everyone they @MONTH1 as well just give up and close all libraries down all around the world because there will be nothing left on the selves	16
22708	4174	Also instead of taking them completly off the shelf if they are that explicet maybe make an eightteen and older section	17
22709	4174	It would solve a lot of problems	18
22710	4174	Yes I agree that there are a select few books,magazines,movies,ect	19
22711	4174	that younger people should not be subjected to, but as and adult you should be able to read,watch,and hear whatever you want	20
22712	4174	That right shouldn't be taken away just because there are children that come to libraries	21
22713	4174	Every library I have ever been to there are certain sections and if your child stays in the section where there type of books are then they should be fine	22
22714	4174	Aside from that though an eightteen and older section would solve a lot of conflict	23
22715	4174	No I do not belive certain material should be taken off the selves if they are found offensive	24
22716	4174	There are way to many ways around having to take the books completely off the selves	25
22717	4174	I don't want to go to a library one day and there be literally nothing left because they took a book off the self every time someone had a problem with it	26
22718	4174	There is absolutly no reason why we can't figure spomething out to make everyone happy and I think that having the eightteen and older section would be a good start	27
22719	4174	For the whole i don't want my child to be sujected to those kinds of things then keep your child away for those kinds of things nobody is forcing them to read anything you don't want them to	28
22720	4175	Libraries            @CAPS1 are many libraries throughout the @LOCATION1 that stock their shelves with materials such as books, magazines, music and movies	0
22721	4175	Libraries do have a purpose I must say, having a library gives out the information that you can't find elsewhere	1
22722	4175	Just think @CAPS1's a huge variety of everything you might need all in one place	2
22723	4175	Certain materials such as magazines and movies that are rated @CAPS2 for instance, should be placed elsewhere on the shelves immediately	3
22724	4175	If you'd like to rent them you @MONTH1 ask for assistance, and go from @CAPS1	4
22725	4175	Children of all ages step foot in your library and are bound to come across unneccessary information	5
22726	4175	In my own perspective @CAPS1 should be an adult section, where only adults above a certain age should be aloud in or be able to check out	6
22727	4175	By keeping such materials shown or on display, @MONTH1 cause children to engage in dangerous or unsafe actions	7
22728	4175	As for music, it can go both ways	8
22729	4175	Music is more of a lifestyle, some people can't live without it	9
22730	4175	Adults in this day and age 'need music to survive' is what they commonly say	10
22731	4175	If your library decides to take these materials off the shelf, people @MONTH1 be turned away and your library @MONTH1 lose buisness.What is a library if you don't have music, books, magazines and movies	11
22732	4175	An empty room	12
22733	4175	Certain materials that are not appropriate for people of all ages should be placed high up, or in their own area where not everyone is aloud at	13
22734	4175	Taking away such materials @MONTH1 cause alot of grief	14
22735	4175	Just reorganize and make libraries enviornmentally safe so everyone is welcomed and @CAPS1 will be no complications	15
22736	4176	Good	0
22737	4176	Bad	1
22738	4176	Offensive or not	2
22739	4176	These are just a few of the questions asked when referring to content in any given book, magazine, or even a song	3
22740	4176	Who are we to judge what's good, what's offensive, or even what is appropriate for any being	4
22741	4176	From things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc	5
22742	4176	the author(s) @MONTH1 express what they feel on a given topic	6
22743	4176	Though their opinion might not please others, there's nothing that can be done about it	7
22744	4176	In society people are going to talk, to write, to sing, to listen	8
22745	4176	Whether everyone agrees with that is a different story	9
22746	4176	In society, no matter what the topic is, there will always be at least one person that has a problem with it	10
22747	4176	The world will never be perfect	11
22748	4176	The only thing that can be done to assuage the chaos is for people to self censor what they @MONTH1 ingest from reading or listening to these different books and lyrics	12
22749	4176	If one shows so much emnity towards a given topic, then they are able to do as they please, and choose not to listen/read	13
22750	4176	At the bottom of numerous cd's, both explicit and non, there is a label, an advisory that warns a person	14
22751	4176	It will briefly tell you that there is some content they @MONTH1 not be appropriate, that @MONTH1 hurt feelings, and simply offend	15
22752	4176	It is then that one can choose to listen to the cd or not	16
22753	4176	Every human is entitled to freedom of speech	17
22754	4176	This doesn't necessarily mean that everything said by a being is okay	18
22755	4176	but everyone is entitled to his own opinion	19
22756	4176	There are words spoken that will offend many	20
22757	4176	From @PERSON1 using racial slurs in speeches, to @LOCATION1 calling females derrogatory words, all the way back to a white male calling his colored friend a nigger	21
22758	4176	People will always be offended	22
22759	4176	There are many different ways of looking at life, and many different opinions	23
22760	4176	Not everyone agrees with one another, because everyone is unique in his own way	24
22761	4176	From ethnicity to personalites, from talented athletes to intelligent students, and even from ancestors to religion	25
22762	4176	Everyone has something that defines them and makes them who they are	26
22763	4176	We are all special	27
22764	4176	and we all think differently	28
22765	4176	We find certain slurs and lyrics offensive, while others @MONTH1 not	29
22766	4176	@NUM1 years ago when i was in @NUM2 grade, my @CAPS1 class was reading a story about the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4'	30
22767	4176	There were @CAPS4 young black children striving to get a respected education in a white school	31
22768	4176	Times were tough then, and there was still alot of racism in @LOCATION2	32
22769	4176	As my teacher read us this book everyday, we all sat and listened taciturnly	33
22770	4176	After the third day of reading this book, we all sat down like usual ready to finish the book	34
22771	4176	Five minutes into class as the teacher was reading the book, she read and enunciated every word in the book	35
22772	4176	In the middle of the sentence, it read 'nigger-lover', and the teacher didn't hesitate a bit as she said it	36
22773	4176	In less than @MONEY1, @NUM3 blacks children walked out of the room yelling curse words at the top of their lungs	37
22774	4176	This teacher didn't realize that she had offended these children by what she took as simply reading to her class	38
22775	4176	The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' wasn't censored in any way	39
22776	4176	Though many children looked at it and felt some of the terms were harsh, no one ever thought there would ever be a riot caused at school	40
22777	4176	Because the teacher was white, and the children didn't want her to say that word, everyone attacked her vocally	41
22778	4176	I've began to realize that everyone cannot be pleased	42
22779	4176	There will always be at least @NUM4 person that stands up and retaliates against something they dislike	43
22780	4176	In '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4', the book wasn't censored, but I still believe that it should stay on library shelves	44
22781	4176	That book allowed children to better understand how hard life was in the past	45
22782	4176	By keeping the harsh language, I feel as if people realize how much harder times were	46
22783	4176	Books, music, movies, and magazines will always contain a statement that someone doesn't agree with, and by removing that I feel like one can not fully understand the message the author is trying to get across	47
22784	4176	For all of these reasons, I proudly say that I believe that these different books, movies, lyrics, and magazines should be kept on the shelves	48
22785	4177	When it comes to the decision of certain materials being allowed in the library, there are many different aspects that must be considered	0
22786	4177	There isn't a particular audience that visits a library	1
22787	4177	Many types of people go to libraries looking for different things	2
22788	4177	Blocking types of materials will lose an audiences interest and they will go eslewhere	3
22789	4177	Now that doesnt mean that offensive materials are acceptable and here is why	4
22790	4177	There should be a level of intensity in which the item is offensive	5
22791	4177	Profanity, and action are minor types of offense	6
22792	4177	However, intense violence and explicit materials such as blood and such needs to have conditions.Categorization is an acceptable method to blocking some @CAPS1 from viewing harmful materials	7
22793	4177	Putting violent books in an area that is blocked to @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1 is an effective way to restrict children	8
22794	4177	Adults would not want to go into this section and therefore would'nt be an issue	9
22795	4177	It is understandable that some people are offended by the materials showcased in libraries because a library is a place for everyone	10
22796	4177	If offensive items were availible only to those who wanted it and hidden from the public, then this is something that could solve the problem	11
22797	4177	Many individuals should realize that a library isn't a place for one type of person and must be shared by all types	12
22798	4177	When it comes books they can be placed in areas availible to epople who enjoy it	13
22799	4177	The same applies for magazines and movies	14
22800	4177	Movies is a form of entertainment that is strongly advertsied over magazines and books	15
22801	4177	Any advertisement that show explicit material or offensive pictures or text should be removed from the view of the public	16
22802	4177	These advertisements should be only viewable by the audience it was inteded for	17
22803	4177	If @CAPS1 wish to use computers there are rules that need to be applied as well	18
22804	4177	@CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1 should have safety precautions that block them from using the computer to look up harmful material, @CAPS1 over the age of @NUM1 know how to avoid certain material and proceed at their own risk	19
22805	4177	These computers should be seperated to avoid peeking eyes from children or anyone who finds the material to be appualing	20
22806	4177	Listening to music on the the computer or by a device should require a couple of things as well	21
22807	4177	If there is a song that isnt preferable to a certain audience or it offends someone headphones should be a requirement	22
22808	4177	The library is a place for peace and quiet so headphones are necessary regardless	23
22809	4177	This can potentially eleminate the problem as long as the headphones themsleves are at an appropriate level	24
22810	4177	If @CAPS1 want to check out any materials that is or can be offensive or explicit in some way  they must prove their age of maturity, due to some items with slight violence being availible to @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1	25
22811	4177	In conclusion, if the categorization of harmful or explicit materials is placed properly and out of view of unwanted viewers or children this can eleminate the issue	26
22812	4177	Music is to be played through headphones only and must be at an appropriate volume	27
22813	4177	No items should not be removed from shelves if they offend people but conditions should be enforced	28
22814	4177	With rules and conditions the library can be a safe and enjoyable place for everyone.	29
22815	4178	I think that the music and other things besides books should stay in the libary	0
22816	4178	Honestly thats where a lot of people go and find other music, yes it could be offinsive to some people, but to others its not	1
22817	4178	They have the right to say they dont want to listen to that stuff, so they dont have to	2
22818	4178	The libary holds over a @NUM1 different kinds of music, movies,magazines, ect	3
22819	4178	So if theres over that many, then why should other people be limited to what they read, hear , and look at	4
22820	4178	The libary is where people go to find new things and explore what other people find interesting	5
22821	4178	Why would they put it in there just to take it all away	6
22822	4178	I remember going to the libary as a young child and looking around me, i saw all these other people look at things i have never even heard of, granted i was only @NUM2, but my point is that, people grow into what they like, they arent just born liking something and thats it	7
22823	4178	I think the library is perfect just the way it is	8
22824	4178	I think that if anything we should put more differnet kinds of music	9
22825	4178	I know not everybody likes the same music, so why would you wantt o force them to	10
22826	4178	I think that the @CAPS1.S is populating more and more everyday, that all we can do is just extend it in every way posible	11
22827	4178	Keeping in mind that not everybody likes to read books, they just find reading magazines and watching movies interesting	12
22828	4178	I know im a person that would much rather watch a movie, or listen to music than read a book.Not everybody is the same, so why would you want to trea them that way	13
22829	4178	Being @NUM3, and if i had to listen to disney tracks all the time, i think i would drive myself crazy	14
22830	4178	I listen to the things i listen to because i have interest in them, if somebody took away my music away i wouldnt know what to do with myself	15
22831	4178	I guess i would just have to readthe books i dont like, and listen to the music i cant stand	16
22832	4178	The music should stay in the libraries because thats where it belongs, you cant make everybody happy	17
22833	4179	In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves	0
22834	4179	These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others	1
22835	4179	They can be against some peoples religion and way of life	2
22836	4179	I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf	3
22837	4179	Now they are putting those same books in libraries	4
22838	4179	These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them	5
22839	4179	Are these books you want your children to be reading	6
22840	4179	There are even movies that are like those books	7
22841	4179	Many shows are based of a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one	8
22842	4179	The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers	9
22843	4179	The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that	10
22844	4179	They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing	11
22845	4179	They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in	12
22846	4179	I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all	13
22847	4179	In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them	14
22848	4179	After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them	15
22849	4179	There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not	16
22850	4179	What do you think	17
22851	4179	Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way	18
22852	4179	Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good	19
22853	4179	Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do?	20
22854	4180	I believe that many books in our local libraries @MONTH1 come off as crude or offensive to many readers, but I also believe it has a lot to do with the maturity level of some people	0
22855	4180	For instance, if you are an adult you will most likely be looking in the adult section	1
22856	4180	There @MONTH1 be children who look through that same section, although their parents should be monitoring what they are checking out at their local libraries	2
22857	4180	Although maturity has a lot to do with it, some young adult books probably aren't intended for the people reading them	3
22858	4180	Some young adult books @MONTH1 be venturing too far, and the children who are reading these books probably shouldn't be	4
22859	4180	I don't think that everyone should have access to check out whatever they want whenever they want	5
22860	4180	Many parents have different rules for their children then others, and they @MONTH1 not agree with what is displayed among these shelves for their child to checkout	6
22861	4180	I remember times when I was a little my parents didn't always let me check out what I wanted, because I was too young to be viewing it in the first place          As for adults, they are free to make their own choices on what to checkout	7
22862	4180	I don't think the adult section at the libraries should be monitored all that much, because as an adult you are free to make your own decisions	8
22863	4180	You know whats right and whats wrong, and no one person should have to tell you what you should or shouldn't be reading	9
22864	4180	The area that I would be most concerned with would be the young adult section	10
22865	4180	At that point children are at an awkward growing stage were they themselves are still learning whats right and wrong	11
22866	4180	Some books or movies could effect the young viewers dramatically	12
22867	4180	Their parents @MONTH1 be letting them watch horrific movies, and it could make them feel as if what they're watching is really okay	13
22868	4180	I think parents should be very involved in their children's lives, and closely monitor what their children are reading or watching	14
22869	4180	I do feel that some books should be monitored, and taken off the shelves if they are found inappropriate for the intended age	15
22870	4180	Mostly in the children and young adult sections, because they could be taking in information they shouldn't be	16
22871	4180	I also feel that parents should take a part in their childs life, and set limits to what their child is aloud viewing	17
22872	4180	Above all, I think that everyone should check out books in their appropriate age section	18
22873	4181	Yes i believe that certain materials such as book's, music, movie's, magazines, etc should be removed off of the shelves at a library if they are offensive in any way	0
22874	4181	Librarian's shouldnt have bad stuff on the shelves at libraries if it is offensive to some people	1
22875	4181	Libraries should only have interesting books with good story's to read and kid books	2
22876	4181	There should be no sexual or racial book's, movies, magazines, etc	3
22877	4181	Those thing's that are found offensive should be taken off the shelf because there are little kids that go to the library and they should'nt be able to see those thing's or check them out	4
22878	4181	I do agree that library's should have a wide range of different kind of book's, and movies, etc because everybody has there own taste in what they like	5
22879	4181	But the thing's that are offensive should'nt be on the shelve's	6
22880	4181	If library's didnt have offensive thing's on the shelf then nobody would have to see them or have arguments about them	7
22881	4181	It would be so much easier because it would'nt cause any problems with people because they would'nt be on the shelf	8
22882	4181	So if they would just take those thing's off the shelf then nobody would see them and there would be no problem's at the libraries	9
22883	4181	Adults and kids could go to the library and pick out what they wanted without seeing the offensive thing's on the shelves which would make it a much better place to enjoy.	10
22884	4182	When you want to read that one special book you heard about but you find out it was considered offensive to some what would you do	0
22885	4182	The public libraries will take all offensive material off shelves for noone to read	1
22886	4182	Then that one special book you wanted to read is now off limits	2
22887	4182	A book someone worked hard on or a song or movie is now stored away because of a little contraversy	3
22888	4182	Do you find that to be fair to our rights	4
22889	4182	I find the fact of cencorship a very confusing topic in public libraries	5
22890	4182	If someone is to write and publish a book then someone will want to read it	6
22891	4182	If some find it offensive then no one can read it how is that fair to the people who do enjoy it	7
22892	4182	The way it should be done is if you dont like it dont read it dont just take it away from all who would want to read it	8
22893	4182	There are some material in libraries i think should be censored to a certain degree	9
22894	4182	Such as anything with nudity or adult content	10
22895	4182	That dose not mean though it should be taken away	11
22896	4182	The stuff with this content should not be taken away but in a seleted area for only adults to view	12
22897	4182	Many movie stores and book stores have the same idea so why dosent the library just adopt that idea	13
22898	4182	We as @CAPS1 have the right to freely state our opinions and what we believe	14
22899	4182	If someone wants to write a book on what they think is right then they are allowed to do that	15
22900	4182	If you censor something just because you dont like what they say that is violation of the constitution	16
22901	4182	You are allowed to express your opinion about it but taking it away cause you @MONTH1 not like it is wrong to do	17
22902	4182	Do you find it fair that people spend so much money and time in writting a book and a few people find it offensive so noone can view it anymore	18
22903	4182	I say if someone spends there time and effort then it should be allowed for those who do enjoy it	19
22904	4182	Is it really so hard for you not to pick up a book that you @MONTH1 find offensive	20
22905	4182	Censorship is good in some cases but inforcing it to much on what someone calls offensive is againts our right to freedom of expression.	21
22906	4183	Should offensive material be censored	0
22907	4183	Removing things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., that are found offensive could be both good and bad	1
22908	4183	It could be good because younger children wouldn't be exposed to things that are considered offensive	2
22909	4183	Although, it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice	3
22910	4183	Most young children don't know good from bad, so censoring these things for them could be good	4
22911	4183	Though, you shouldn't want to shelter your children from the real world	5
22912	4183	Protecting your children from things that offend you, @MONTH1 stop them from growing up badly	6
22913	4183	Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there	7
22914	4183	Censoring or removing things that you find offensive @MONTH1 be a good idea	8
22915	4183	There are plenty of reasons someone @MONTH1 want to do this	9
22916	4183	A parent @MONTH1 not want their child to read, hear, or see something simply because it offends them	10
22917	4183	Another reason parents @MONTH1 want to censor these things is just because they don't want their child exposed to it	11
22918	4183	Parents know that most young children don't know right from wrong, so they'd like to make that choice for them	12
22919	4183	By doing this, a parent knows what their child is reading, hearing, or seeing	13
22920	4183	Some parents @MONTH1 feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to them	14
22921	4183	They also @MONTH1 feel this should be done so their child doesn't grow up badly	15
22922	4183	Removing offensive material from shelves would take away from a person's freemdom of choice	16
22923	4183	Who wants to be told what they can and cannot read	17
22924	4183	If a parent does this to their child, it just sheltering them from the world around them	18
22925	4183	A child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost	19
22926	4183	Parents @MONTH1 think that this is good idea because it protects their children from things that @MONTH1 be considered bad	20
22927	4183	When really, protecting them could be harmful	21
22928	4183	Censoring books, movies, music, ect., won't stop what is already bought and out in our world	22
22929	4183	Offensive music, movies, books, ect., have already been bought and sold for years	23
22930	4183	I feel that censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, ect., should not be done	24
22931	4183	It doesn't give people a choice	25
22932	4183	Some people @MONTH1 like reading graphic novels or things like that	26
22933	4183	Music is made for the enjoyment of the people	27
22934	4183	Some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse, why take that away from them	28
22935	4183	It just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone	29
22936	4183	A movie is just a movie, it's not real	30
22937	4183	Just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean that a person will go off and do it	31
22938	4183	I think people should be able to have a choice	32
22939	4183	Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there	33
22940	4183	If people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others	34
22941	4183	Plenty of people have illegaly downloaded, or bought music that uses inapropriate language	35
22942	4183	This music is already in their iPods, @NUM1's, and burned onto @CAPS1, there's no removing it	36
22943	4183	Books that some @MONTH1 find offensive have already been printed and sold to others	37
22944	4183	One person @MONTH1 lend that book to another, therefore the offensive book is being spread around	38
22945	4183	Plenty of movies that involve adult content, violence, and drugs have been released into the media	39
22946	4183	Lots of people own these kinds of movies	40
22947	4183	So, why censor things now, when there's already unremovable offensive material out?	41
22948	4184	The many books, movies, music, and magazines in the world could be offensive	0
22949	4184	In all of these examples there could be bad language, pictures, and messages	1
22950	4184	No matter where people go they can find something that could offend someone	2
22951	4184	No matter what, people will try and get rid of eveything bad but the truth is they are gonna be around forever if not a very long time	3
22952	4184	In @CAPS1 @CAPS2 all the students in grade ten just got done reading '@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 @CAPS5.' The story is about a runaway @NUM1er named @CAPS6	4
22953	4184	and a runaway boy named @CAPS7	5
22954	4184	many librarys have banned this book because of the use of the n-word	6
22955	4184	'@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 @CAPS5' has profanity in it, and people don't want that book to be taught in @CAPS2	7
22956	4184	I personaly think it should be taught, because it shows students today what it was like back when there was slavery	8
22957	4184	Music is something that mostly everyone listens to	9
22958	4184	Songs always have a meaning or a subject the artist sings or raps about	10
22959	4184	many song artist write about love, money, and fame,  yet others write about drugs, profanity, and  suicide	11
22960	4184	Hip-hop, rap, country, rock, metal, jazz, r&b, punk, ect., are only a few of the hundreds of types of music out there	12
22961	4184	and at least @NUM2 songs of each type have a bad meaning behind it	13
22962	4184	Magazines and movies are the same way	14
22963	4184	Magazines and movies have everything between cars to bad pictures in them and historical places, facts, and documents to action	15
22964	4184	Even though there are age limits to buy or see stuff it still doesnt mean that it  couldent get into a teens hands	16
22965	4184	Because there is bad language in music, movies, books, etc., doesnt mean it should be banned, just limmited	17
22966	4184	No, it is not wrong to put what you feel into a book or into a movie just make sure it is analized right so it can only be checked out or sold to the people of the right age	18
22967	4184	What the children and teens are into now will affect the world in a later time and keep on going untill there is a change made.	19
22968	4185	We live in a world @DATE1 inundated and persuaded by media	0
22969	4185	Ever since we were little, our young minds have been filled with opinions of others from history and from the present	1
22970	4185	Whether we are reading a book, watching a motion picture, or even listening to a new music artist, our lives are being affected by such media	2
22971	4185	The art world is considered to be one of the most controversal businesses to work in	3
22972	4185	Each piece of literature or movie is shared by a vast community of critics	4
22973	4185	We all are given the right to our opinion on such  pieces	5
22974	4185	Every piece of art is judged and then criticized	6
22975	4185	However, many find certain pieces to be offending in some way, shape, or form	7
22976	4185	It is quite impossible to produce such a piece that will fit everybody's satisfaction	8
22977	4185	For an example, religious pieces are often scorned for their nonfactual information or for the director's or author's opinion over the matter	9
22978	4185	Since we live in such a diverse community of religions, these pieces will never satisfy the audience	10
22979	4185	Movies have been criticized for decades because they represent some sort of life lesson or truth that is not appealing to the audience	11
22980	4185	Why not learn from them and reflect	12
22981	4185	No piece of media can possibly be directed to satisfy the opinions of all the world	13
22982	4185	As a personal example, I can see that novels and books over war are heavily criticized	14
22983	4185	The men and women who fought for our country @MONTH1 enjoy to see such pieces written about them, but war protesters and peace keepers @MONTH1 see this as an insult to their cause	15
22984	4185	@PERSON1 wrote a book by the name @CAPS1 @NUM1	16
22985	4185	This book was heavily criticized over the topic of censorship	17
22986	4185	The world in which they lived in had dramatically been affected by the impact of peoples opinions	18
22987	4185	If a book or movie was offensive to a group of people, then they burned the books	19
22988	4185	History books about slavery and war were burned because others found the topics offending	20
22989	4185	Non-religious groups thought that religion was offensive, so they burned the @CAPS2 and other works of religion	21
22990	4185	Their government wanted a world of peace and a community where every man was equal and diversity was no longer existent	22
22991	4185	@PERSON1 denies the book was written over censorship but his book gives our generation a great lesson	23
22992	4185	For generations, we have grown up in a world of diversity	24
22993	4185	Every mind is special and different and will never share identical thoughts as his neighbor	25
22994	4185	Therefore, we must recognize that we have to survive and live together	26
22995	4185	We can not escape the diversity in which we live in	27
22996	4185	The books we see on shelves, the movies we see on the big screen, and music we listen through our earphones all make up our generations history and the next	28
22997	4185	We need to accept our neighbor and his opinions because we are all born equal	29
22998	4185	If we throw away our history and our accomplishments, man is left nothing to improve on, nothing to leave his or her marking on history	30
22999	4185	We have to accept others ideas and build on them to improve our life and other's	31
23000	4185	As we stand @DATE1 in a world filled with diversity, we must move on and reflect	32
23001	4185	It is not a time to offend and be offended but a time to learn and move on	33
23002	4186	I am writing you today to propose an explanation on my views of censorship in libraries	0
23003	4186	I recently had visited a library and some of the things I read in my time being there was really overwhelming.I think it should be censored and taking off the shelf	1
23004	4186	If you are a place of business you should not want things like that on your shelf	2
23005	4186	You should not want costumers reading it and feeling disgusted	3
23006	4186	I hope something I write will propose my reasons	4
23007	4186	I have plenty of reasons to censor things and have them taking off the shelves that are offensive to me and others who visit the library, but only speaking on my behalf there were certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., that was offensive	5
23008	4186	I believe things in the nature should be handled in great authority	6
23009	4186	If anything I am trying to help me and my fellow citizens	7
23010	4186	Just think if a visitor come in and pick up a magazine and it has insulting visual details of something that the reader can relate to or have experienced, and it is getting talked down about instead of beeing looked at, then they would be very offened	8
23011	4186	For them to come there it had to be a reson that they came, I know it wasn't so they would feel insulted	9
23012	4186	It is very inappropiate to have things that are offensive in the library	10
23013	4186	It is plenty of different reason people come to libraries	11
23014	4186	Some come to get away, and to others its a daily routine	12
23015	4186	Whatever the case maybe they should feel comfortable in the place they are at	13
23016	4186	Why would you want people in the community or people period to not be comfortable where they are at	14
23017	4186	Just think if they are uncomfortable, then they are going to tell others and you will loose alot of fellow friends and alot of business	15
23018	4186	Think strongly on the things you do and the way you approach things to get peoples attention	16
23019	4186	To answer the question @CAPS1, I agree strongly on getting the offensive materials moved from the shelves	17
23020	4186	I believe in making people happy and one thing that is wrong with society today is too much judging and talking down and talking bad about people	18
23021	4186	If people would not judge or insult people then the world would be alot safer	19
23022	4186	It has to start somewhere, every little start causes for a great ending	20
23023	4186	I think this would be a good start on making the world happier and bringing all of us closer together	21
23024	4186	I hope something I wrote will help you on your descision	22
23025	4188	I do believe that certain materials should be taken of the shelves if they are found offensive	0
23026	4188	I think children should only be able to read certain books cause, some books say things should know until they get older.Some books, music, movies , magazines should be removed if offensive	1
23027	4188	I think they shouldnt make some kids movies , books, music like that for little kids	2
23028	4188	They put to many things they should not  in kids movies	3
23029	4188	The movie the @CAPS1 they should not let kids watch that movie its not a movie i would let my kids see until they was older.The reason why is cause it has alot of  bad language in it 	4
23030	4188	It is about these guys who take ruphies	5
23031	4188	This guy cheats on his girlfriend, and it is just not a movie that i would let my kids watch.There are people getting drunk in the movie 	6
23032	4188	they do stupied things.They try to make it look like its a good thing to do and that it is so fun to do all those things	7
23033	4188	I just think that is not a movie to let kids watch	8
23034	4188	Some music has to much bad language in it	9
23035	4188	I think they should make better songs for kids	10
23036	4188	Songs that really mean something or about someone	11
23037	4188	Most of these songs they sing now is about dumb things that do not mean anything.I think some magazines are okay to read but some just talk about actors	12
23038	4188	Like @PERSON1 I read one time about here doing something that was bad, and she should not be doing	13
23039	4188	I think it depends on what the magazine is and what it talks about in it	14
23040	4188	I believe that if they are offensive they should be taken of the shelves	15
23041	4188	I also think that if they are not offensive and do not talk about bad things kids should be able to see them or read them	16
23042	4188	If they did that kids would not talk and do things like they do today.That  kids would not try to stell and things like they do in these movies they see it happen or there friends do it	17
23043	4188	So they think it is cool for them to go out and do things like that but, it is not.	18
23044	4189	Offensive metaerial like that should most definately be removed from the shelf	0
23045	4189	What if a child finds it	1
23046	4189	They @MONTH1 think its the coolest thing they've every seen	2
23047	4189	Children shouldnt be able to access this kind of material at all, especially from a place like a library	3
23048	4189	Sombody could easily pick it off the shelf not knowing what it is	4
23049	4189	They @MONTH1 start reading it and not know what they're getting into, but it would be there fault for picking it off the shelves	5
23050	4189	This kind of material should only be places it is welcome, not in librarys or public places like that	6
23051	4189	If the material was at a type of book store that was not meant for people under @NUM1 to go to, then yeah it is meant to be on the shelf because children aern't aloud in that building, therefore they cannot see it unless it was brought out of the store to a household or somthing	7
23052	4189	Depending on where you go, if that meterial is on the shelf, say at a place that is not so public, and you pick it up and start reading or watching it, you have yourself to blame for not researching the book or case of the material	8
23053	4189	If people want to get it they can, but it would be at there own risk	9
23054	4189	There for if the consumer takes it off the shelf, its there risk of being offended	10
23055	4189	There for they cannot blame the place the material was at.	11
23056	4190	@CAPS1 us	0
23057	4190	@CAPS1 now	1
23058	4190	Those questions just might be flashing through your head right now	2
23059	4190	The reason @CAPS1 I am writing to you today is to give you my point of view on the censorship in the worlds libraries today	3
23060	4190	In this context hopefully I will be able to enlighten you on the subject, also with the questions of '@CAPS1 us?', and '@CAPS1 now?'	4
23061	4190	Censorship, what does that mean to you	5
23062	4190	To me that means censoring many things in the world to protect it from children who are under the age, not people who are old enough to handle inapropiate things	6
23063	4190	In todays libraries there are many uncensored things, that happen to be in the adult section of the libraries	7
23064	4190	Things such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the adult section, also labeled as the uncensored section, if that is where they rightfully belong	8
23065	4190	Now you are probably wondering, @CAPS1 us	9
23066	4190	In today's world many people want to protect their children from harmful things, such as uncensored materials	10
23067	4190	@CAPS1 us	11
23068	4190	In the world today there are so many laws, regulations, and even authorities protecting our rights	12
23069	4190	Now many people want to try to get around the government protecting our rights	13
23070	4190	Many want to protect their youth from some of the so called 'harmful' things in society	14
23071	4190	Today you can try to create a law or bill that @MONTH1 make it through the government, now some of them are trying to remove the uncensored material	15
23072	4190	@CAPS1 now	16
23073	4190	Throught the years the world has changed, everything has become easier to have access to	17
23074	4190	Now one thing they think they @MONTH1 be able to do is remove the adult section of the libraries if enough people stand to fight for it, it will not happen	18
23075	4190	There is an adult section for adults not children, people need to realize that	19
23076	4190	In the end, the adult section needs to stay in our libraries	20
23077	4190	Some of the material in the section is not always bad, sometimes it contains material over war, and recessions	21
23078	4190	When people are of age they are allowed to enter the areas, not any younger	22
23079	4190	Don't punish the rest of the world for one libraries mistake of letting children have access to adult material, make the children realize it wasn't their area to be in	23
23080	4190	Then many parents @MONTH1 see it's not just some of the world, that the whole world is exactly the same way	24
23081	4190	The books, music, magazines, and etc., need to stay where they are	25
23082	4192	I believe books, music, movies, magazines, and etc	0
23083	4192	should be removed from the lilbrary if they are offensive	1
23084	4192	Some peole take things wrong and lilbraries could have issuses	2
23085	4192	Also keeps customers happy and it will get ou more guests daily	3
23086	4192	Lastly, it might let someone feel better about themselves	4
23087	4192	First, some people will take things wrong and lilbraries will have issuses	5
23088	4192	If someone comes into the lilbray in feel its something in the lilbrary that is offensive you can get a lawsuite	6
23089	4192	Also it could set off anyones mind to feel disrepsected and feel they dnt have to respect the lilbrary because the library isnt respecting them	7
23090	4192	It can cause plan in someones eyes by making them feel like they arent equal around other people	8
23091	4192	Second, it keeps customers happy	9
23092	4192	If a customer feel that they see something offensive and the lilbrary discards of the object it will make them feel that you respect them	10
23093	4192	If you keep offensive things in a llbray less people will cum to the lilbrary if they feel they are offended and have no say in if it should be removed	11
23094	4192	The more people feel home bond the more they will come	12
23095	4192	Next, it might let someone feel better	13
23096	4192	If you walked into the lilbrary and seen something you didnt like in there you would want it removed too	14
23097	4192	If it didnt get removed you would feel that you are not respected and you will feel not wanted	15
23098	4192	Lets say someone see something offensive and the lilbrary doesnt remove it and the person took a book out the lilbrary, then never returned it you would lose money because you would have to get new books in stock	16
23099	4192	In @CAPS1, there are many ways to resolve problems and resolve issuses without conflict	17
23100	4192	You can disrespect someone and they might disrespect you back, but when it all come down to it you have to give repsect to get it	18
23101	4192	somethings help people feel better about themselves and keep there day goin	19
23102	4192	So before you make your decision thing would you want it done to you	20
23103	4194	Censorship in libraries is a topic that is argued back and forth in todays society	0
23104	4194	It is something that we all should think about and voice our opinions about	1
23105	4194	I believe that items in a library should not be censored based on constitutional @CAPS5, the creation of gray areas, and the depletion of classic literature	2
23106	4194	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 to the @CAPS3 of the @ORGANIZATION1, clearly @LOCATION1 the idea of freedom of the press	3
23107	4194	Not only does this give publishers the right to print whatever they please, but it also gives people a right to choose for themselves what they can and want to read	4
23108	4194	Censoring books in a library would be denying this right that is clearly spelled out in the @CAPS4 of @CAPS5	5
23109	4194	I refuse to support any idea that directly opposes the @CAPS3 and the people of the @LOCATION1 should be appalled that this sort of thing is even in discussion	6
23110	4194	When it comes to censoring something based on how offensive something is, one always has to consider the gray areas that will be formed	7
23111	4194	For instance, what is offensive in one book @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else who would benefit from reading it	8
23112	4194	The term 'offensive' is a reletive one, in that the definition varies from person to person	9
23113	4194	No one thing can be deemed offensive by one hundred percent of the population and therefore no one thing can be removed without opposition	10
23114	4194	This creates areas of gray where there is no right answer	11
23115	4194	This would be extremely problamatic for those trying to censor items within  a library	12
23116	4194	Secondly, the decision on who would get to decide what is and is not offensive would cause as much contreversy as the books themselves	13
23117	4194	Knowing that every person carries a different opinion the people deciding would have to equally represent every persons' opinion when making a decision, talk about problamatic	14
23118	4194	Finally, censoring books would eliminate classic literature and would deplete an understanding of the world through the eyes of great writers	15
23119	4194	For example, in @PERSON1's '@CAPS7 @PERSON2' the 'n' word appears over one hundred times	16
23120	4194	Many @CAPS8 @CAPS9 take great offense at the use of this word	17
23121	4194	However, this book is seen as one of the centuries greatest works and cannot be removed from the education of young people because of an offensive term	18
23122	4194	If people want to censor books, then censor them from their own children and not the children of others and inevitably an entire population	19
23123	4194	In conclusion, the censorship of literature and other items in a library is not only impossible, but utterly unconstituional	20
23124	4194	The idea of censoring items from children based on offense is not something that should be pursued	21
23125	4195	There are many forms of entertainment in the world today	0
23126	4195	Almost anyone has access to movies, magazines, newspapers, music, books, television and radio	1
23127	4195	While these examples @MONTH1 seem relatively innocent, there are many cases where they can be found very offensive	2
23128	4195	When the book, magazine or movie was create, it @MONTH1 not have been made to be offensive	3
23129	4195	A group of people @MONTH1 find something very offensive that most other people wouldn't even think about	4
23130	4195	There are many types of consumers and it is hard not to offend anyone due to the wide variety of people	5
23131	4195	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies or magazines should not be removed from the shelves, even if they are found offensive	6
23132	4195	The act of censorship in libraries, or anywhere, should be looked down upon	7
23133	4195	No one is being forced to read a book or magazine, watch a movie or listen to music	8
23134	4195	If someone finds a book offensive, then the solution is simple: don't read it	9
23135	4195	Others @MONTH1 find the book to be inspirational and uplifting, and taking the option of reading it away from the person is wrong	10
23136	4195	There are many forms of entertainment that could be taken the wrong way and be offensive to people	11
23137	4195	To take away any book or magazine that could be offensive to any group of people would be a large task	12
23138	4195	Taking away all offensive books would do away with a large portion of books available in libraries	13
23139	4195	If a person doesn't want to read a book because of the offensive nature of the book, then he can leave it on the shelf and pick a different book	14
23140	4195	The book should not be taken away from other people just because someone @MONTH1 be offended by it	15
23141	4195	Everyone has a different view on things	16
23142	4195	Many people @MONTH1 think one way about something, while other people think of it completely different	17
23143	4195	This is why all different forms of books, magazines, radio and music could be offensive to people	18
23144	4195	For example, a person @MONTH1 be offended if a book talks about a certain topic while another person thinks nothing of it and reads on	19
23145	4195	This person @MONTH1 enjoy the book and pass it on for others to enjoy	20
23146	4195	If it was taken off the shelves because it offended the first person, no one would have the option of enjoying it	21
23147	4195	Just because something is offensive to one person, does not mean it is offensive to everyone	22
23148	4195	I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong	23
23149	4195	There are many personal reasons why someone @MONTH1 be offended by something, but that doesnt mean it should be taken away from the general public	24
23150	4195	People @MONTH1 miss out of a very good book or movie if it is removed from the shelves due to someone being offended by it	25
23151	4195	If a person finds a book, for example, to be offensive, they can easily stop reading the book and pick another one	26
23152	4195	No one is forcing them to read something they don't want to	27
23153	4195	Also, the book @MONTH1 be very enlightening to another person, and removing it completely would be unfair to them	28
23154	4195	Censoring the content in libraries is wrong.	29
23155	4196	Living in todays society there are many diffrent people and many diffrent outlooks on things, the world is a diverse place that should have no restrictions	0
23156	4196	There are an uncountable number of diffrent ways people look at the world and ways that people percieve things	1
23157	4196	To tell someone what they should and should not know is simple minded in the aspect that anyone can percieve a book, music, movie, or magazine diffrently	2
23158	4196	@CAPS3 quote by Katherine Paterson,in short, metophorically uses a book and a shelf to let the reader comprehend the importance of information that is passed down from generation to generation	3
23159	4196	The book represents the information in the world and the shelf stands for the the place the imformation is stored for one to go seek information	4
23160	4196	To remove the book off the shelf indefinatly is to close the mind of a future generation	5
23161	4196	It was once said ' you can not know your present without knowing your future.' @CAPS1 the book @MONTH1 offend one reader it could also inspire another as well	6
23162	4196	Everyone has a diffrent opinion and life style	7
23163	4196	@CAPS1 @CAPS2 people are granted with better lifestyles than others, @CAPS2 are unfortunatly living everyday in struggle	8
23164	4196	One book that @MONTH1 offend a person who thinks the book is harsh and should be taken off the shelf, could also inspire a young child going through struggle's to overcome there surroundings and be a better person	9
23165	4196	I have read many books that did not interest me and passed them on to my sibligs and friends	10
23166	4196	Shockingly the book interested them	11
23167	4196	After interviewing my siblings and friend over the book it turns out that they got a diffrent message from the book than I	12
23168	4196	No one thinks the same thoughts a hundred percent of the time	13
23169	4196	'@CAPS2 @MONTH1 argue that the glass is half empty while others argue it is half full.' @CAPS3 quote is a perfect example of the minds of the world today	14
23170	4196	Ultimatly if everyone thought the same then everyone would be the same person	15
23171	4196	To 'leave no books left on the shelf for any of us' is like programing a robot to only do what you say	16
23172	4196	In such a diverse community it is impossible to remove any book off the shelf	17
23173	4196	Living in todays society there many diffrent people and many diffrent outlooks on things, the world is a diverse place that should have no restrictions	18
23174	4198	Libraries across the world are facing the obstacle of censorship	0
23175	4198	Censorship has become a bigger deal in this day and age	1
23176	4198	@CAPS4 can effect books, music, movies, magazines, and many more	2
23177	4198	This posts the question is censorship a good thing or is @CAPS4 bad	3
23178	4198	Censorship allows certain books to be removed from the shelves of a library if a certain person finds the book to be offensive	4
23179	4198	Everyone has there own opinion about things so why should that effect what we are allowed to learn	5
23180	4198	What one person finds offensive could be perfectly fine with everyone else	6
23181	4198	Plus you are not being forced to @CAPS3 something you @CAPS1'@CAPS2 want to	7
23182	4198	If you find @CAPS4 ofensive then one solution is very easy, @CAPS1'@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4	8
23183	4198	Censorship not only effects the learner, @CAPS4 effects the writer	9
23184	4198	Censorship takes away the one thing a writer has, there freedom of speech	10
23185	4198	Writers create books, music, and magazine articles to voice there thoughts on topics, to show others how they see the world, and to show what might happened to them in their life	11
23186	4198	Because writers do this, @CAPS4 makes a connection with the reader that they can understand and relate too	12
23187	4198	Writers have a choice what they want to convey to the world and they should be given the privalge to do so	13
23188	4198	Even if you are able to put a censorship on books and music at a library, you can'@CAPS2 censor the internet	14
23189	4198	The internet has become a place where anyone around the world can find websites that they like, where there are books, music, magazines, and even shopping stores	15
23190	4198	A library is a public library just like the internet is public too	16
23191	4198	Anyone should be able to acess @CAPS4 and enjoy what they like	17
23192	4198	Putting censorship on things is almost equivilent to not letting a teacher teach because of there nationality or not letting our president give a speech because he is @CAPS5	18
23193	4198	Censorship is based on a opinion someone has	19
23194	4198	@CAPS4 shouldn'@CAPS2 effect the learners or the writers	20
23195	4198	Censorship holds back the voice of society and the thoughts of everyday people	21
23196	4198	Censorship should not even exist	22
23197	4199	Libraries are often thought of as a room full of books inside a school building	0
23198	4199	On the contrary, they are all over the country, and are used by people of all ages	1
23199	4199	Because of that, I feel that there should not be a restriction on what books a library puts on their shelves	2
23200	4199	If the books and magazines are labeled, then a person can just stay away from what he or she finds offensive	3
23201	4199	However, in the case of a school library, all the books of course should be age appropriate	4
23202	4199	Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean you neighbor won't	5
23203	4199	If someone find a movie ridiculous and inappropriate, that doesn't mean someone else will too	6
23204	4199	Since all people are different, no one will like the same movies as the next person	7
23205	4199	Therefor, a personally offensive movie should not be removed from the shelves and prevent the enjoyment of another individual	8
23206	4199	That is the same with magazines, books, and anything available at a library	9
23207	4199	Parental concern for their children is also a factor	10
23208	4199	However, if a public library has a section of books or magazines that is found to be offensive by a parent of a young child, I do not think that should require the library to remove the book	11
23209	4199	This is where I believe organization and limitations come in	12
23210	4199	The adult books and magazines that might be offensive for children should be in a section in a separate room, or on a different level of the building	13
23211	4199	That would prevent the accidental discovery by children	14
23212	4199	Along with organization, I think there should be a limitation, so that if a child was to purposely walk into that section and grab a book that was not appropriate, or offensive to the parent, then they would not be able to check it out at the desk from the librarian	15
23213	4199	Outside of public libaries, the school libraries have a different requirement in my opinion	16
23214	4199	Elementary libraries of course, should contain no inappropriate material to any extent.All of the material in an elementary library should be strictly for education	17
23215	4199	At that age, children are far too young for any form of adult humor or magazine article	18
23216	4199	At the @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 level, I think things should change a little, but should still be much more strict than a public library, and contain absolutely no offensive content	19
23217	4199	I feel that magazines and joke books are welcome in the libraries of teenagers	20
23218	4199	Nothing that would be inappropriate for the school rules though of course	21
23219	4199	Public libraries are a place for children and adults alike to find a book or movie to entertain themselves, and everyone has a different opinion	22
23220	4199	Because of that, there should be no restrictions in the public libraries, and you should be able to get the books or movies you want	23
23221	4199	Within a school corporation the environment changes, and the rules must be changed as well	24
23222	4199	Nothing offensive should be placed within a school library no matter how old the students are	25
23223	4199	Libraries should not be required to remove books from their shelves.	26
23224	4201	Libraries hold more than just books, magazines, and movies..	0
23225	4201	They hold history	1
23226	4201	With out any doubt, there is offensive material printed on numerous pages spread through out the thousands of books and magazines a library holds	2
23227	4201	Some find this terrible, but I on the other hand, completly disagree	3
23228	4201	Every book has a different story to tell, and everyone comprehends the content differently so I think libraries shouldn't take out offensive material from their shelves	4
23229	4201	What's really considered offensive	5
23230	4201	This question would be very hard to answer because everyone has a different veiw, different opinons, and a different background	6
23231	4201	Some would say violence, drugs, gangs, and sexual situations are offensive..	7
23232	4201	While others consider religion, beliefs, traditions, and morals offensive	8
23233	4201	With all the different veiws on what someone finds offensive, a library would have to almost completly clean their shelves just to remove a small porportion of it	9
23234	4201	There's many sections in a library, from fiction to children stories	10
23235	4201	If there is an area for 'children books,' and 'adult books,' @CAPS1 can't there be one for materials some readers would find offensive	11
23236	4201	Libraries could even mark a book if it held something offensive.This would settle many conflicts	12
23237	4201	If a reader chooses to read a book that was marked with offensive content, they would have no right to get upset	13
23238	4201	Limiting our libraries shelves is unthinkable	14
23239	4201	If someone got offended by what they read, they could put the book down just as fast as they picked it up	15
23240	4201	A public library is a public place, where many people go..	16
23241	4201	so if one person gets offended by something they read or saw, doesn't mean the next person will	17
23242	4201	Bottom line is, no book should be taking away because someone couldn't handle what was being sad	18
23243	4201	'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	19
23244	4201	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 everyone's veiw on offensive material is different, eliminating it would be hard	20
23245	4201	One person found this book offensive, so it's gone..	21
23246	4201	The library would be pointless	22
23247	4201	The shelves would empty, because the loss of many phenomenal books	23
23248	4201	People do get offended, that's just life..	24
23249	4201	I don't think that they should be able to take a book away from everyone just because of one person's opinon on it	25
23250	4202	Censorship has been the topic of many debates involving politicians, @CAPS2 activists, and the everyday citizen	0
23251	4202	There are groups that believe the government has every right to censor anything that is considered offensive in today's society	1
23252	4202	Some individuals could argue with this belief by supporting the statement that it is not the government's position to decide what is considered offensive and what is not	2
23253	4202	I just so happen to agree	3
23254	4202	One opinion, mainly supported by people with children, is that books, music, and movies ect	4
23255	4202	should be censored to protect the younger generations	5
23256	4202	While it is true that parents should be concerned with what their children are exposed to, if the offensive material that is involved in the everyday life of an adult is completely restricted from an individual as a child how is he or she expected to be prepared and excel in the future	6
23257	4202	Why do we go to school for atleast twelve years of our lives	7
23258	4202	We go to prepare ourselves for the challenges of being an adult	8
23259	4202	We place ourselves in an environment that is specifically created to make us comfortable with the responsibilities of maturity	9
23260	4202	If not properly exposed to something, there is absolutely no way to be prepared to encounter it in the future	10
23261	4202	However, not all individuals support censorship because of their children	11
23262	4202	There are adults that would like to see no more of today's offensive material for their selves than they would want their children to see	12
23263	4202	My rebuddle to this is that if you do not want to see it then do not choose to see it	13
23264	4202	No individual is ever forced to be exposed to anything in todays media	14
23265	4202	Turn off the television if the program bothers you	15
23266	4202	Do not read the book or magazine	16
23267	4202	Change the radio station	17
23268	4202	Every person is capable of controlling what they hear and see, and it is unnessecary to attempt to remove from society what could simply be ignored	18
23269	4202	Lastly, one of the most consistent debates around censorship is that the government should control what is included in today's media	19
23270	4202	Think back in @LOCATION1's history	20
23271	4202	when has giving the government more power in our everyday lives ever been good for our society	21
23272	4202	The reason our forefathers founded our great country was to have the freedom they were isolated from in @LOCATION2	22
23273	4202	The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 was created to insure that the government could not attempt to control what they had no right to control	23
23274	4202	The freedom of speech is not just referring to what comes from an individual's mouth, but what goes into their eyes and ears as well	24
23275	4202	The citizens of this great country are more than capable of deciding for theirselves what is offensive to them and what is not	25
23276	4202	It is the government's duty to protect our country from other countries and groups of people who attempt to break it apart, but not to control what we see and hear	26
23277	4202	Meeting and debates are held everyday to enhance the quality of our freedom and occasionally to gain more freedom	27
23278	4202	I ask why some individuals would want to give one freedom we do have away	28
23279	4202	The @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the greatest countries ever to exist, yet we are too lazy to decide what we are exposed to in our everyday lives	29
23280	4202	It is time for our society to stop being nurtured by the government and start doing our own dirty laundry	30
23281	4203	Have you ever felt that books are offensive	0
23282	4203	Maybe, but @CAPS2 all depends on who you are and @CAPS1 angers you	1
23283	4203	Somepeople think that books, music, movies, and etc	2
23284	4203	can be offensive in some way	3
23285	4203	I know they can, but @CAPS2 can only effect an amount of people if they together understand the problem	4
23286	4203	I think there are several ways why and why not to take books out of our libraries	5
23287	4203	From @CAPS1 I hear, people do go angry over things but the question is '@CAPS1 gets them so angry?' @CAPS2 is different for somepeople than others	6
23288	4203	For example, a @ORGANIZATION1 fan reads a book about them and the author makes fun of them or teases them	7
23289	4203	That is a way to make someone offended and angry at a book	8
23290	4203	others can get mad at a movie because @CAPS2 discriminates races of other kinds	9
23291	4203	Like how in the @NUM1's, some movies characterized @CAPS3 @CAPS4 as stubborn, ignorant, human beings	10
23292	4203	In my view, actually being @CAPS3 @CAPS6 myself, sort of aggrivates me too, but none the less, shouldnt argue because of one major amendment, freedom of speech	11
23293	4203	@CAPS2 depends on how @CAPS2 angers them also, like how back in world war @NUM2, the @CAPS7 people were characterized as short, fat people with big noses taking all the money away from the @CAPS8	12
23294	4203	That can be offensive, and is used usually to talk people over to their side	13
23295	4203	I think that if something offends you lightly, most of the time you shouldnt worry about @CAPS2, but if you get offended very heavily and none of the stuff they say about that topic is true, maybe you should get someone else to read @CAPS2 with the same dislikes and likes as you	14
23296	4203	That could help determine if @CAPS2 is truly offrnsive to people in general, not just you	15
23297	4203	Then after that the main question we would ask would be '@CAPS1 should we do next?' If I were someone and the book I'm reading offends me massively, I would contact the library @CAPS2 came from and ask them to read @CAPS2, and if they think @CAPS2 is offensive, then they would more than likely take @CAPS2 off the shelfs	16
23298	4203	Now just because of someone that likes a sports team reads a book about them and the book talks trash about the team, dont tell the library, thats just a waste of time	17
23299	4203	Just simply pick up another book and read @CAPS2	18
23300	4203	I can understand how people will get mad over racism and disrimination, but not over a sports team	19
23301	4203	So I hope that people can someday understand the limit to were something can actually be offending	20
23302	4203	Or maybe its just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of	21
23303	4203	That is why I think that books should only be taken off shelfs for only very good reasons, not silly one	22
23304	4205	Do you like what I like	0
23305	4205	Maybe and maybe not	1
23306	4205	What is or not offensive to you compared to other varies on both ends	2
23307	4205	Why	3
23308	4205	Everyone has their point of view	4
23309	4205	You @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree and we have others who do not care	5
23310	4205	There are many which includes: religious beliefs, having independence, and experimenting	6
23311	4205	Religious beliefs are important would you not agree	7
23312	4205	Certain material in this world maybe offensive to their own kind	8
23313	4205	Such as gay rights	9
23314	4205	This @MONTH1 apply to everyone else that they are not accepting it	10
23315	4205	For the ones who do accept it, you can tell they are open minded	11
23316	4205	Unlike the rebels going against it that is their own state of mind	12
23317	4205	I believe it is important you go along with your religious beliefs	13
23318	4205	Independence is what we are or what we assume to have or already have	14
23319	4205	Whether the music, movies, magazines, etc are offensive to others this has no effects to you	15
23320	4205	Why	16
23321	4205	It is because you know what is right and wrong	17
23322	4205	So what if all the non sense things @MONTH1 have caught your attention	18
23323	4205	Should you take control and get rid of it	19
23324	4205	No	20
23325	4205	It does not bother you	21
23326	4205	You take it as it is, being independent	22
23327	4205	Experimenting is self contained	23
23328	4205	As simple as it is you do it or do not	24
23329	4205	It is more than likey that people are/were under the influence	25
23330	4205	I, myself, have been in that siutation before	26
23331	4205	I'm known to be the crazy child in the family	27
23332	4205	My dad would always lecture me about being careful with who I hang with when I'm out	28
23333	4205	As a teenager I let those words pass by me	29
23334	4205	I was always the youngest out of the people I hung out with	30
23335	4205	Was I ever under the influence	31
23336	4205	Yes	32
23337	4205	Did I ever get hurt	33
23338	4205	No	34
23339	4205	I can and will say I experimented with life	35
23340	4205	Does it hurt to observe or experiment with the bad	36
23341	4205	It usually varies	37
23342	4205	Religious beliefs, it @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not be disrespectful	38
23343	4205	To have independence, you are the one in control	39
23344	4205	Experimenting, that is a choice on your own	40
23345	4205	What is offensive to me @MONTH1 not be to you	41
23346	4205	I have my own state of mind and so do you.	42
23347	4207	Banned books.'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
23348	4207	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work that I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
23349	4207	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'                                                         Katherine Paterson                                                          Author     I believe and will stand by katherine's statement above	2
23350	4207	Who @CAPS5 to say if a book @CAPS5 offinsive	3
23351	4207	People have a right to their oppinion, but i do not think any one has the right to take books away from a @CAPS1 library	4
23352	4207	@CAPS1 library, the facts are in the name	5
23353	4207	It @CAPS5 a @CAPS1 library, where people can go and find a book to pass time, a book to use on an @CAPS2 assignment, or a book to read to their child	6
23354	4207	Taking a book off the shelves just because it offendid someone does not makes sense to me	7
23355	4207	A person can pick up a book, be offended and complian about it, that @CAPS5 freedom of speech	8
23356	4207	I do not see fault in that	9
23357	4207	But when a person picks up a book, @CAPS5 offendid,and demand that the book per se @CAPS5 taken off the shelves of a @CAPS1 library	10
23358	4207	That @CAPS5 when i have issues seeing where they think they have the right	11
23359	4207	Katherine Paterson said in her text that 'If i have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work i abhor- then you aslo have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	12
23360	4207	And then we have no books left on the shelve for any of us.' @CAPS3't that a scary thought	13
23361	4207	If a person was offended by a book they could take it off the shelve at his or her own will	14
23362	4207	I fear the out come of that	15
23363	4207	I am sure that a person could figure out something offensive about any book	16
23364	4207	Taking books off the shelve @CAPS5 taking knowledge away from the people	17
23365	4207	We as @CAPS4 have the right to read at our pleasure, any book that we have the slighest whim to read, and be able to read that book with out prosecution from a people that find the book in question 'offensive.'     The day we let people take books off the shelves because they offend them, @CAPS5 the day our first admendment fails	18
23366	4207	As a nation we need to stand stron againts banning books from @CAPS1 libraries	19
23367	4207	For our generation and for the many generations to follow.	20
23368	4208	One @MONTH1 subject the censorship of library content in certain places and times, whether fictional or not, to his or her own opinion	0
23369	4208	I personally disagree with the concept	1
23370	4208	The facts point out that society fears the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the outcome of similar campaigns and has instated systems designed to prevent such occurrences	2
23371	4208	Certain examples stand in play to explicate my opinion	3
23372	4208	Society, at least in my native @LOCATION1 and surely abroad in other democratic countries, dislikes enforced censorship for a few reasons	4
23373	4208	First, many countries have a @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and priviledges upheld in the face of the law	5
23374	4208	Our founding fathers wrote out one of the documents establishing this trend on the prompting of the general public	6
23375	4208	The first ten ammendments to our fine constitution, bundled as the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, resulted	7
23376	4208	Some of the included statements ensure the freedom to speak as it publicly pleases us as citizens and the freedom to write, individually and collectively without boundaries	8
23377	4208	The removal of these principles so ingrained in our nation's conscience would cause a general uproar	9
23378	4208	We as a people instituted our government to preserve our freedoms, and we could prepare ourselves to replace it as implied in the @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 if so required of us to continue doing just that	10
23379	4208	Secondly, publications such as the ones mentioned for banning rebuke the enforcement of opinion for its effects on society	11
23380	4208	I can mention three books portraying this dystopic outlook on censorship	12
23381	4208	'@CAPS5 @NUM1,' required by state standards for one possible choice of reading assigned to us by my teacher, describes book burning and utmost uniformity between citizens	13
23382	4208	'@DATE1,' by @PERSON2, I know describes a dystopia in which all citizens completely submit their will to and omnipotent '@CAPS6 @CAPS7,' who utilizes omnicient surveillanceeven though I have not read the composition myself	14
23383	4208	'@CAPS8 @CAPS7,' a recent novel by @PERSON1 whose title employs a pun on the name of @DATE1's prime antagonist, weaves the exciting tale of an older teenager who tries to beat the system of surveillance from under the radar	15
23384	4208	All, however, betray a sense of fear in their content, and that fear has transferred directly into local civilization	16
23385	4208	In reviewing the aspects of censorship portrayed in its effects, the system itself reveals that the even the intended creation of a utopia and compliance through censorship @MONTH1 result in decline and misery throughout the area within which government or civil officials practice the method	17
23386	4208	In any case, a more effective solution must exist today	18
23387	4208	To prove the point, let me introduce some content advisory systems currently in place	19
23388	4208	Libraries divide themselves into sections for the various age groups, and therefore create an inherent barrier between differing groups of content deemed appropriate only in the face of maturity	20
23389	4208	The film and television industries rely on ratings displayed at various times during video to provide the same sort of psychological fence dividing content into pieces	21
23390	4208	Even the video game industry, into which I plan to inject myself upon exiting college, has a system in place to separate existing media into tiered subcategories designed in a similar way to film ratings	22
23391	4208	Different regions utilize different systems, but that of  the @ORGANIZATION3, or the @ORGANIZATION1 for the @ORGANIZATION2, compares relatively well in ranking video games to the rest of the globe	23
23392	4208	As explained, censorship already exists in a form accptable to all	24
23393	4208	Nobody forces anybody to comply to the recommendations, but hopefully everyone does so on their honor	25
23394	4208	Capable parents most definely follow the guidelines which have cropped up over the years	26
23395	4208	Only if these methods of moderation were enforced would everyone be upset	27
23396	4208	It's up to everyone to prevent a situation like unto the worst-case scenario and useresponsibly the systems available for this purpose	28
23397	4209	The ideas conveyed by literature, music, and movies are an art	0
23398	4209	They cannot be explained in any other way than themselves, and if we take away the right to produce or the right to sell these masterpieces, then the world loses something of itself	1
23399	4209	Censorship is the underlying problem to many things	2
23400	4209	It takes away the expression of human thought and emotion- emotions like greed, love, fear, and the ability to empathize that are conveyed in books and films	3
23401	4209	If people think it's offensive, they simply can't take the truth	4
23402	4209	Many people can only express themselves in their art- and art can be very real	5
23403	4209	So real that we don't think that it's possible	6
23404	4209	We don't want to believe something like 'The @CAPS1' could happen	7
23405	4209	'The @CAPS1' is a short story in which kids get together and rob an old man's home	8
23406	4209	Because this man is very rich, he has lots of material wealth	9
23407	4209	Then they burn down the house with the man's belongings still in it	10
23408	4209	Needless to say, this story has been banned from many schools and libraries	11
23409	4209	But what many don't understand is why would the kids burn down the house	12
23410	4209	Many think that the kids just want to see it burn, to destroy what is so cherished, or that the love of material things is making us greedy	13
23411	4209	It is this that makes us think, and therein lies the problems with censorship	14
23412	4209	If we censor something that makes us think this hard about who we are and what we do here, then we begin to lose ourselves	15
23413	4209	The loss of books has been seen throughout history	16
23414	4209	Most prominantly, the nazi regime	17
23415	4209	In the beginning of their control of power, they banned certain books that went against the nazi ideals	18
23416	4209	The censorship escalated into the nazis burning books in large piles	19
23417	4209	This communal burning would make it easier to control the public mindset	20
23418	4209	The movement swelled and the  @CAPS3 people soon developed a national pride and goal	21
23419	4209	By the @DATE1's, nearly every @CAPS3 who could read had read '@CAPS5 @CAPS6'	22
23420	4209	The censorship had turned into an all-out war on classical literature and the promotion of nazi ideas	23
23421	4209	That was how @CAPS7 was actually voted in	24
23422	4209	Many don't realize, but the @CAPS8 actually did vote @CAPS7 to be leader	25
23423	4209	Now that the nazis had destroyed the publics ideals, they were replaced with the nazi's own	26
23424	4209	The banning of media can only lead to a general lack of self knowledge	27
23425	4209	The human mindset can only be expressed through the art which the human creates	28
23426	4209	If we try to explain it, we soon get lost in our words	29
23427	4209	The use of verbal and visual examples is the only way we learn who we are	30
23428	4209	Censorship has never ended in something good- only the promotion of something bad	31
23429	4209	If we let our media get banned, we lose the right to have ideas of our own.	32
23430	4212	Certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, and comics can be offensive to certain people	0
23431	4212	When we look at a comic and see that the writer of the comic has said something offensive, what @MONTH1 seem offensive to you @MONTH1 not be offensive to anyone else	1
23432	4212	Certain pictures or writings that seem full of knowledge and vibrance to you @MONTH1 be completely something else in someone elses eyes	2
23433	4212	How many humans inhabit the world today	3
23434	4212	About @NUM1 billion, researchers say	4
23435	4212	If you think about it, each and every one of those @NUM1 billion minds thinks differently	5
23436	4212	If a librarian takes away the knowledge that you find so vibrant, it is like taking away a person's ability to learn	6
23437	4212	In the world today, many teenagers and young adults are becoming more involved	7
23438	4212	What that teenager reads in that magazine article could spark a whole new reason to help the world	8
23439	4212	For all you know, the magazine could have gotten the young adult or scientist one step closer to finding the cure for cancer	9
23440	4212	How could you just take that away	10
23441	4212	Again, the magazine could be offensive to a person who @MONTH1 have cancer or a doctor who treats cancer, but will they be offended when their cancer is cured	11
23442	4212	Or when the doctor can successfully say that all of the cancer in your body has gone away	12
23443	4212	If we take everything away that could possibly be offensive to other people, we might as well just take all the books, movies, magazines, and comics away that have ever been created	13
23444	4212	Once again, something that @MONTH1 be offensive to you would not be offensive to another person, because about @NUM1 billion minds do not all think alike	14
23445	4212	If reading materials were taken away that are found offensive, our ability to learn and grow as humans might as well be taken away as well.	15
23446	4213	Culture and history are two very important aspects of the world	0
23447	4213	Liraries are placs that house these very things for the enjoyment of all who visit them	1
23448	4213	This is why i believe libraries should not censor any of their materials	2
23449	4213	Learning has always been and will be a key aspect of living and libraies offer this to people freely	3
23450	4213	How can one take that freedom away from another	4
23451	4213	Not all things in the world and history are perfect and have occured in the ideal way	5
23452	4213	However, subjects such as slavery, the @CAPS1, and other controversial topics must be known about	6
23453	4213	These horrible happenings @MONTH1 offend some but they cannot be erased from the past	7
23454	4213	Learning is natural to humans yet we always try to fight it	8
23455	4213	It is not right to hide the truth	9
23456	4213	Some people are easily offended and some are not	10
23457	4213	But the true question is,'who is to say what is offensive?'	11
23458	4213	There are people who believe that discussing @CAPS2 in the christian religion is offnsive and others who believe any type of homosexuality is also	12
23459	4213	Yet there are still others whose believes directly contradict these	13
23460	4213	Libraries must maintain all types of material becuase their purpose is to hold knowledge and not just what people want to know	14
23461	4213	How can we make better decisions in the future if we do not recognize what has occured in the past	15
23462	4213	Removing information from the library because it is offensive is essentially depriving people solutions to problems	16
23463	4213	All aspects of culture and history should be preserved so that we can know where we came from, the mistakes we made, and how we plan to fix our new ones	17
23464	4213	History has never been in the control of man	18
23465	4213	In conclusion, libraries should not censor any of their materials	19
23466	4213	What has happened in the past cannot be changed or altered to fit our ideal visions	20
23467	4213	And by doing this we deprive future generations of information that could potentially be useful	21
23468	4213	We must never forget who we are as a people, and where we came from	22
23469	4213	Our knowledge and ability to learn is our greatest asset and must be treasured.	23
23470	4214	People of all ages have the right to read any material that they want @CAPS1 or other family members @MONTH1 tell their children not to read about a certain topic	0
23471	4214	Those children will either listen to their @CAPS1 or not	1
23472	4214	If these children do not listen, we need to do something about it	2
23473	4214	We need to have rules in libraries	3
23474	4214	Children do not need bad influences in thier lives.Adults have the right to keep children away from this information	4
23475	4214	Leaders of a library have many different sections in their library	5
23476	4214	Children and adults both have thier own sections as well as teens	6
23477	4214	These groups of people have a right to choose what material it is that they want to read, watch, or listen to	7
23478	4214	I believe that if we make the sections have an age limit we can prevent children from finding bad information	8
23479	4214	Right now, children can read this information at any time	9
23480	4214	Adults can eliminate it	10
23481	4214	Children in libraries should be supervized	11
23482	4214	Too many books are about drugs, sex, or pregnancy	12
23483	4214	Reading this material @MONTH1 give off bad information to a child	13
23484	4214	Children are not old enough to be learning about sex	14
23485	4214	@CAPS1 should be the first to tell thier child about sex	15
23486	4214	Young children know about drugs and know that those drugs are harmful	16
23487	4214	Children learn about drugs in movies, books, and can hear about them in music	17
23488	4214	Many books deal with pregnacy as well	18
23489	4214	Learning about pregnancy make them think how that women got pregnant with a child	19
23490	4214	Those children then start to ask other adults and children	20
23491	4214	Children can also read or listen about gun violence	21
23492	4214	Children read about gangs and think that it is cool	22
23493	4214	They then want to play with toy guns and pretend that they are in a gang	23
23494	4214	This information is very harmful and should not be allowed to children	24
23495	4214	After some children read about it they get thier friends involved	25
23496	4214	This information can spread across the school	26
23497	4214	Violence is very harmful for children	27
23498	4214	Librarians are not in control of the material people wish to read	28
23499	4214	If that library has offensive material it is their job not to let that material get into a young persons hands	29
23500	4214	They should be able to have strict limits on age apropriate material	30
23501	4214	If a child tries to check out a book and it seems to be over their age limit, they should not be allowed to have the book	31
23502	4214	The sections that they @MONTH1 find harmful information should be closed to young children	32
23503	4214	Children in libraries should be supervized	33
23504	4214	Books about drugs, sex, or pregnacy @MONTH1 not be allowed for children to read	34
23505	4214	Violence in books seem to spread across schools	35
23506	4214	Adults can help prevent harmful information from all children.	36
23507	4215	I think that their should be rooms were certain adult books are at	0
23508	4215	I think that they should have to be of age to get the books in that section	1
23509	4215	I feel strongly that libraries should have every differnt kind of book for anyone	2
23510	4215	Everyone goes to a library so i think it should be an open library and have all different kinds of books	3
23511	4215	If a kid or a teenager is trying to get an adult book someone of age should have to come their and check the book out for them	4
23512	4215	I think that libraries are for everyone in a community and that not everyone reads and looks at good nice books some look at naughty books and they should have the right to go and check out books like that	5
23513	4215	When you go to a library you should be able to go their and get whatever genre that you want and their be no restrictions	6
23514	4215	I think that the only restriction that should be made is the age limit on naughty adult books or novels and if they are very bad then they should be behind the desk and you have to be of age to get it	7
23515	4215	My conclusion is, if you are going to look at all kinds of books they should have no restrictions on what you look at	8
23516	4215	You should be of age for romance novels and darougatory books but for the library they should have tons of books and magazines with no restrictions	9
23517	4217	Censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society	0
23518	4217	Our lives have been taken over by politcal correctness, so much so that our voices are no longer our own	1
23519	4217	Until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts, no matter what those thoughts were, in any form of media	2
23520	4217	But now if something is found to be offensive in any way it is essentially burned	3
23521	4217	Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our @CAPS2 as citizens and people, shields us from the truths of the world, and limits the knowledge we can take from, as well as ensuring that one day there will be nothing left of media	4
23522	4217	The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, the document that our country lives by, says that we as people have the right of free speech	5
23523	4217	Censorship actively and violently violates that right	6
23524	4217	Our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away	7
23525	4217	Our own words forced down our throats, never allowed to come out	8
23526	4217	Censorship ensures that no opinions will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, that no one can assume or think for themselves	9
23527	4217	Is this not what we are supposedly guaranteed by freedom of speech	10
23528	4217	We are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say	11
23529	4217	We know there are consequences for saying certain things, but we are supposed to be allowed to say them	12
23530	4217	Letting our own ideas into the world allows for new ideas to form	13
23531	4217	Arguements come, but these arguements allow people to see other ideas that they hadn't thought of and look at issues from new perspectives	14
23532	4217	We are able to see our world through different eyes when we hear or read someone else's opinions	15
23533	4217	And from there we can form our own opinions, allowing our world to be rich with iddeas and knowledge, and allowing our society to advance	16
23534	4217	But censorship wants to take this all away from us in order to please everyone	17
23535	4217	But there will always be someone who is unhappy	18
23536	4217	It's the inevitable truth	19
23537	4217	Censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world	20
23538	4217	In a way this makes sense	21
23539	4217	We don't want our children to understand the atrocities that happen in everyday life	22
23540	4217	We don't want them knowing what's happening behind closed doors	23
23541	4217	However, if we don't allow people to open these doors, they can never understand the world or be prepared for the experiences that are to come	24
23542	4217	Learning the harsh realities of our society educates people, allowing them to stop these realities as well as be prepared for when they happen to them	25
23543	4217	For example, let's look at the issue of rape	26
23544	4217	Rape is a horrible thing, but it happens	27
23545	4217	It is a nasty part of reality	28
23546	4217	Rape can be censored from books, televsion, and other forms of media	29
23547	4217	We can walk around pretending rape doesn't exist	30
23548	4217	But that doesn't accomplish anything	31
23549	4217	That doesn't get rid of rape	32
23550	4217	It still exists	33
23551	4217	And if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape, how will it ever stop	34
23552	4217	How will a rape ever be able to be prevented	35
23553	4217	How will someone know what to expect or what to do	36
23554	4217	By censoring rape from media, we are ensuring that the people in future generations never learn about rape	37
23555	4217	Knowledge of rape is important if it is ever going to be stopped	38
23556	4217	Pretending something doesn't exist doesn't get rid of it	39
23557	4217	Censorship is supposed to protect the people, but it doesn't	40
23558	4217	It hurts the people, cutting off their access to knowledge	41
23559	4217	We as people need knowledge	42
23560	4217	We live off of knowledge	43
23561	4217	And the way we obtain this knowledge is through media	44
23562	4217	Censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually	45
23563	4217	It @MONTH1 not seem like a lot is missing now, but as time goes on the gap will increase, and more knowledge will be taken from our grasp	46
23564	4217	Is this fair	47
23565	4217	Is this right	48
23566	4217	Is this helping us	49
23567	4217	How does cutting out knowledge ever help	50
23568	4217	It brings us backwards in time, makes us fear	51
23569	4217	It is human nature to fear the unknown	52
23570	4217	The more that becomes unknown, the more we have to fear	53
23571	4217	Censorship is taking away crucial pieces of knowledge that we must understand to get along in society	54
23572	4217	This is wrong and immoral	55
23573	4217	It is unfair, if nothing else	56
23574	4217	We should be allowed to take from any knowledge that exists	57
23575	4217	No good comes from hiding it	58
23576	4217	Lastly, this gradual burning of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways	59
23577	4217	And as time goes on it can only get worse	60
23578	4217	Censorship is based off of offensiveness	61
23579	4217	If something could be offensive, it is disposed of	62
23580	4217	However, everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone	63
23581	4217	Therefore everything and everyone should be censored in order to fulfill the goal of censorship	64
23582	4217	This means all media of any kind should be destroyed	65
23583	4217	No one should say anything	66
23584	4217	The world would be forced to be silent	67
23585	4217	All knowledge would be taken away	68
23586	4217	Chaos would ensue	69
23587	4217	The people's freedom would be completely taken away	70
23588	4217	The freedom to know would vaporize right in front of their eyes	71
23589	4217	This is our future if we allow the censorship to continue	72
23590	4217	We cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship	73
23591	4217	Yes, people's feelings will be hurt, but we cannot rid our world of ideas and knowledge purely to spare feelings	74
23592	4217	These ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away	75
23593	4217	Censorship is taking away our freedoms and @CAPS2, slowly stealing them away from us	76
23594	4217	It also tries to shield us from reality, but instead hurts us, ensuring that we will never understand our world and never be able to stop the very things that are being censored	77
23595	4217	Censorship is affecting society, ensuring that our freedoms are to be taken away	78
23596	4217	All knowledge will be trashed and no one will be able to voice their opinions	79
23597	4217	A very dark future waits for us if censorship continues	80
23598	4217	Only by helping people to understand censorship and the wrong it does to society can we gain back our freedom of speech	81
23599	4217	the freedom we are supposedly guaranteed, but censorship is desperately trying to take away.	82
23600	4218	Materials that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelve	0
23601	4218	People might need those materials for research or if they just want to find out about something	1
23602	4218	If the material is offensive to someone they can report it but the people that work at the library might not do anything about it	2
23603	4218	The people that find something offensive could also ignore it and walk away	3
23604	4218	If I found something that was offensive to me I would just ignore it	4
23605	4218	I might look at it to see what it says but I would not say anything about it	5
23606	4218	There are some people that would have to look at that for research or something else	6
23607	4218	So why get it removed from the shelve	7
23608	4218	I have not seen anything that would be offensive to me yet but, if I did then I would not say anything	8
23609	4218	Now some people would say something but, what if you walked in a library looking for a book for your research paper, and it was not there because someone found it offensive	9
23610	4218	What would you do	10
23611	4218	Yes you could get on the internet but, it might not have what you are looking for exactly	11
23612	4218	I have had a lot of research papers	12
23613	4218	There was one time when I went to the library and could not find a book or a magazine to help me with my research	13
23614	4218	I had to wait for over an hour just to get on the computer to look information up	14
23615	4218	When I did get on the computer I only had an hour to look up everything	15
23616	4218	I did not get it done in time and had to turn it in late	16
23617	4218	Computers are good for looking up stuff, but when you have a book in mind that would give you a lot of information, you go for the book not the computer	17
23618	4218	I know there are materials that are offensive to people	18
23619	4218	I know people get mad at them but, it is not the librarys fault	19
23620	4218	They most likely have to have those materials on the shelve because that is whats required of them	20
23621	4218	So if people do get mad they can report it or just walk away and ignore it.	21
23622	4219	To @CAPS1 it @DATE2 concern,     @CAPS2 in life has to deal with something offensive towards them at least once	0
23623	4219	It @DATE2 be swear words in a popular song, or even people's behavior and actions on a regular basis	1
23624	4219	Be that as it @DATE2, nobody was made perfectly, and we all have to learn to cope with people's flaws	2
23625	4219	The library is for everyone	3
23626	4219	not just you specifically	4
23627	4219	Just like people's personalities we have to deal with different things that fit those specific personalities	5
23628	4219	@PERSON1's quote said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right...' @CAPS3 is a strong and truthful accusation, and I believe that things in a library should should have some censorship, but up to a specific point	6
23629	4219	We all realize that the biggest population of people in a library-- and perhaps the most innocent-- are children	7
23630	4219	Each parent has different values and standards for their child	8
23631	4219	What @DATE2 be offensive to one parent @DATE2 not be to another	9
23632	4219	If one mother thinks a book that talks about something she believes to be inappropriate to her children should be removed, another mother @DATE2 not	10
23633	4219	The first mother's opinion is different than everyone else	11
23634	4219	she could say she wanted @CAPS3 book removed from the library, but then so could the second mother about a different book	12
23635	4219	If everyone voiced their opinion on what books they didn't think were appropriate for their children, then we would 'have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' according to Katherine Paterson	13
23636	4219	I believe she is right	14
23637	4219	Besides, who is to say what is right for everyone	15
23638	4219	Not one person has the same morals or values as another	16
23639	4219	For one person to declare what is right could highly offend another individual	17
23640	4219	I have dealt with situations like @CAPS3 before	18
23641	4219	everyone has	19
23642	4219	People tell me what they believe to be right, and I do not agree with them	20
23643	4219	It is simply a matter of everyday life	21
23644	4219	people's opinions and morals are going to clash	22
23645	4219	Eveyone is different, and if one person doesn't like a certain magazine in the library, another person @DATE2 not like a different one	23
23646	4219	If we were to all voice our own opinion on what we want censored and what we don't, nothing would be left	24
23647	4219	The library shelves would be completely empty	25
23648	4219	Even though everyone has different opinions on what should stay and what should go, I do believe that there should be some censoring up to a certain point	26
23649	4219	Taking into account everyone's diversification in @CAPS3 world, I do believe that there should be censorship up to a certain point	27
23650	4219	If something is in a book that a good majority of the population are against, I believe that the book, or books should be removed	28
23651	4219	I am not saying that because a couple of people weren't for a certain artist from the @DATE1 that it should be taken away at once	29
23652	4219	If it is a major issue that highly offends many people, it should not be in a public library	30
23653	4219	Libraries are for obtaining information, and for reading	31
23654	4219	not for brewing up offensive opinions on certain topics	32
23655	4219	There should be a certain limit on what is in a library, because there are things out there people really shouldn't be seeing or hearing	33
23656	4219	But it shouldn't get to the point where people can just remove books from the shelf at their own free will	34
23657	4219	Without some limit on censorship in a library, absolutely anything could be found there	35
23658	4219	When we think of a library we don't think of things that are offensive	36
23659	4219	People view the library as a positive place, created for people's own personal enjoyment	37
23660	4219	That doesn't mean that we will never find something that @DATE2 offend us in some way there, but people should not be able to just remove books from the shelf because they don't agree with their morals	38
23661	4219	@CAPS2 is different, and nobody has the right to tell them what exactly is right or wrong, up to a certain point	39
23662	4219	I know from experience that it can be a tough thing to ignore sometimes, but we all seem to do it everday with the people around us	40
23663	4219	we can't just choose to get rid of them	41
23664	4219	@CAPS2 wants to be comfortable, but sometimes we just have to deal with things in life like a book we don't deem appropriate	42
23665	4219	So I believe that in a way, an excessive amount censorship on things in a library can be a bad thing	43
23666	4219	If we all could get rid of what we wanted in a library, there would be nothing left	44
23667	4219	Afterall, I wouldn't mind walking into a library with shelves full of magazines and books, instead of one completely empty	45
23668	4219	Thank you.	46
23669	4220	Libraries are ment for all types of books, movies, music, magazines	0
23670	4220	It gives you a variety of things to look at or even check out	1
23671	4220	An offensive book or movie or even music shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because it has a few bad things in it	2
23672	4220	People @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree with this, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion	3
23673	4220	Through my own experiences, observations, and the reading I will help and explain my own opinion in why i dont think offensive books, movies,music, and magazines should not be taken off the shelf	4
23674	4220	If a book is offensive it does not deserve to be taken off the shelf	5
23675	4220	Somebody most likley worked hard on that book so it could be put on to the shelf	6
23676	4220	If you find a book offensive it should be put off into a different section that tells you in head of time what books are in that section	7
23677	4220	I have not had any real experiences with this but I know people are awear of what are in the books before they're put onto the shelf and would therefore not put anything offensive next to a childrens book	8
23678	4220	Same thing with music and @CAPS1's	9
23679	4220	Music is music and it is there to be listened too	10
23680	4220	People like all types of music and have their favorite bands so if they dont like certain bands because they swear or whatever doesn't mean that album deserves to be taken off the shelf	11
23681	4220	@CAPS1's usually have the rating on the front so if it is not appropriate for your age than dont pick it up	12
23682	4220	If it has nudity or sexual content it will tell you or be put in a different section	13
23683	4220	For instance at my old library where I used to live in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 they would put all rated @CAPS2 movies into a different section and if you were going to check it out you would have to be @NUM1 or older or have a parent with you	14
23684	4220	It is really all up to the person, they could either make the right choice or the wrong choice	15
23685	4220	It's not the libraries fault if you pick up an offensive book because well, you should have some common sense	16
23686	4220	The libraries shouldnt have to take offensive things off the shelfs because some people lack common sense or just dont know what they are doing	17
23687	4220	They could make more of an effort too kind of seperate bad from good, wrong from right, and even appropriate to non appropriate	18
23688	4220	But it is usually all up to the person making that decesion	19
23689	4220	- @PERSON1	20
23690	4222	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
23691	4222	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
23692	4222	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I disagree with Katherine Paterson's statement because there is a @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 and the @CAPS1 to Write	2
23693	4222	The author obviously had a purpose to write the novel, compose the music, or to deliver the movie	3
23694	4222	There will always be items that will be offensive to some people, but to others there is a meaning behind it	4
23695	4222	The @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 gives everyone the right to speak what is on their mind	5
23696	4222	That @CAPS1 allows them to publish whatever they have to say in a novel, a piece of music, or in a movie	6
23697	4222	Sure there @MONTH1 be some parts that @MONTH1 be inappropriate somewhere in a novel, piece of music, or a movie, but that doesn't mean the whole item will be inappropriate	7
23698	4222	Some people might think some things can be offensive while others don't at all	8
23699	4222	There maybe somethings out there in this world that you @MONTH1 think are offensive, but have you stood up and told that company yourself	9
23700	4222	Being able to put down anything on paper that you want everyone to know about is the @CAPS1 to write	10
23701	4222	With that you can't be told not to do so	11
23702	4222	For example, the '@CAPS6' magazine maybe offensive to an abundent number of parents who don't want their kids to look at it, but that magazine isn't intended for children to look at	12
23703	4222	That magazine's purpose is to show adults what is all out there to buy to make their appearance sexy	13
23704	4222	It's not to be offensive to anyone and that company has the @CAPS1 of write to publish such a thing	14
23705	4222	The @CAPS1 to write serves its own purpose to all of the writers, composers, directors, and anyone who wants to write in a journal or to write a note	15
23706	4222	I bet there has been a novel, a piece of music, or a movie that you just love	16
23707	4222	Well within it there most likely was a piece of information that was inappropriate, but would you like to see that taken off of the shelf	17
23708	4222	For example, I once read a series when I was in middle school that had inappropriate content about sexual interaction, but that series is what every girl wanted to read	18
23709	4222	If they would have taken them off the shelf because they were not appropriate then I know plenty more novels that would be gone as well	19
23710	4222	What would you say if there was nothing left on the shelves to read, listen to, or to watch	20
23711	4222	Without items such as books we could have a hard time learning new stuff all the time	21
23712	4222	These are the items that teach us new things everyday	22
23713	4222	Would you be able to enjoy your life without being able to read, watching movies or @CAPS7 shows, or listening to music	23
23714	4222	It would be a very hard thing to get used to in today's society	24
23715	4222	We rely on such things @NUM1 to get us through the day and teach us things we were never taught	25
23716	4222	Disagreeing with the quote that Katherine Paterson stated is one way to use @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 by stating my view of removing inappropriate items off of shelves	26
23717	4222	Removing items of the shelves won't solve the proplem of having too much inappropriate usage in today's society	27
23718	4222	If everything that had some kind of inapporpriate content in it removed from shelves, we would have a hard time finding a novel to read, music to listen to, a magazine to enjoy, and a movie or @CAPS7 show to watch	28
23719	4222	Lots of schools rely of books to read and without a book childrens vocabulary could have a great downfall	29
23720	4222	Think about it...what would you be able to do in your free time if we had no more books, movies, magazines, or music	30
23721	4223	Books, magazines, movies, music, etc, are all good to read, watch or listen to	0
23722	4223	When I listen to music or watch movies or even read books sometimes	1
23723	4223	I wonder how do people come up with these ideas.The real reason is why people listen to music, read books watch movies are so offensive	2
23724	4223	In todays world you got music with all this negative stuff about people, talkin about people, with the curse words its not a good look for the people who make the music or the people who listen to the music	3
23725	4223	I feel that that stuff not be allowed in the shelves and it should be removed	4
23726	4223	Parents dont want there little children hearing that negative music	5
23727	4223	When they grow up they are going to be like them because everybody sings there songs and everything else	6
23728	4223	I feel movies should not be removed from the shelves	7
23729	4223	The reason i say is because movies are funny, scary, sad etc.Sometimes u need the offensive in a movie, with out that it would not be good most of the time	8
23730	4223	One of my favorite is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and it was about character from the past @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 get back together and do one more mission	9
23731	4223	That movie was offensive but u still have a good time watchin it because its has the nice cars and good character	10
23732	4223	Movies should never get removed from the shelves cause out offensive of movies it would not be fun.People can not go to the movies with there friends and have a good time.If u are taking little kids out make sure u pick the right movies for them.To conclude argument Music is not bad thing to listen cause u have good music to but all im saying is make sure to watch what u listen to and get in trouble trying to do what they say in there music.To the movies keep comming out with good movies and keep making the movies good	11
23733	4224	People go to the library to find certain types of material	0
23734	4224	Some people get offended by some of the material and feel that it should be removed	1
23735	4224	Certain materials should not be removed if found offensive to others because it might not be offensive to someone else that might enjoy it	2
23736	4224	The offensive material can be history that the world need to know, such as racism	3
23737	4224	If they did not know the importance of slavery they wouldn't know of the past life and why we are treated the way we are being treated	4
23738	4224	History is a big part of life that everyone one should know	5
23739	4224	That's why we have history class to let us know of the history that we've been through	6
23740	4224	All material don't have to be history that is offensive	7
23741	4224	Some material have sex and violence that is offensive	8
23742	4224	The libraries should have labels on every section to let people know what type of material it is	9
23743	4224	If people know what type of material it is and still choose to view it then they get what they ask for	10
23744	4224	It shouldn't be removed because they didn't like it	11
23745	4224	I learned in history class about wars that had violence in them that some of my classmates didn't like but that's what happened and we needed to know	12
23746	4224	Materials are made for a reason	13
23747	4224	They should not be removed if found offensive to someone but not offensive to another	14
23748	4224	I read books in school with all kinds of violence and other things people @MONTH1 not like but it's history	15
23749	4224	History makes a difference in our lives and it's what we need	16
23750	4224	You can not removed that	17
23751	4224	If you find it offensive just don't view that material again.	18
23752	4225	I believe that the books, music, movies, magazines should be removed if they are really offensive	0
23753	4225	Just because it's offensive to one person doesn't mean that it would be to another person	1
23754	4225	Any movie you watch could be offensive to one person or two but, not everyone	2
23755	4225	So I would say no to taking the offensive things off the shelfs because, who is really going to be offened by and are they really offened by this matter or aspect	3
23756	4225	Also, I believe that some people might lie about if they are offened by it just so that they will take it off the self	4
23757	4225	Maybe, there is a movie for example, that there is a lot of bad words, I could see them being able to take that off the self because, a lot of people don't like those words to be used and thats understandable	5
23758	4225	If they are just taking it off the self tho for one little thing I don't think that should be aloud	6
23759	4225	I think that if that person is getting offened by what a book said or a movie said then don't read it or don't watch it	7
23760	4225	No body is forcing you to watch or read a book that you don't want to	8
23761	4225	Reading and watching a certain movie is all up to you not what others say	9
23762	4225	I believe that this really has to go down to what the persons beliefs are	10
23763	4225	Maybe they go to church every day which means that they probably aren't going to be watching the movie ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2.'  They are going to pick a movie more suitiable to their life style and what their use to	11
23764	4225	Maybe they had a friend that suggested that they should watch a movie and they did, they might have taking offensivness to that, but that was also there choice they didn't have to watch it	12
23765	4225	If this was the case to take a book, movie, music out because someone was offened then there would be nothing left	13
23766	4225	Are you saying that you would listen to everyone if they came in to get a book and then came back and said ' this book offened me, I want you to take it off the self.' I'm sorry but, I'm having a hard time believing that your going to listen to every single person that comes in a says that	14
23767	4225	Also, @CAPS3 do you know it was offensive to them are you going to have them show you what was the problem with this book	15
23768	4225	My guess is no because you don't want to deal with that many people about one or two maybe even five books	16
23769	4225	I'm not saying that people don't get offened by somethings that books and movies say but, your going to have a lot more then just one person come in and say that there are more then just one book or movie	17
23770	4225	so then there would be no books left	18
23771	4225	What if you have someone come in and they request that they have a certain movie and you say ' @CAPS4, I'm sorry we had to take that movie off the self because, it offened someone.' I have a feeling that person is not going to be happy and you will have some explaining to do	19
23772	4225	Also, what if a person comes in and asks for something and you tell them that you had to take it down and they say that it was a very nice movie are you going to listen to them also if you listen to one person don't you think that its fair if you listen to the other person also that likes the movie	20
23773	4225	I am a person that believes theres two parts to every story	21
23774	4225	So, therefore, I think that you should listen to both sides or keep what you have if that person wants to take it off the self then do it but, if someone asks for that specific one then I would let them have it because that isn't going to hurt the person that got offened by the book or movie is it	22
23775	4225	Therefore, I think that they should keep the books, movies and music all on the seleves unless more then one person complains then it would be a different story.	23
23776	4226	Movies is to popcorn as music is to headphones	0
23777	4226	Right	1
23778	4226	It is all fun and games until someone's innocence is completely destroyed	2
23779	4226	The simplest forms of entertainment are being minipulated by today's world	3
23780	4226	Many of the children in our modern society are quickly becoming conditioned and used to seeing and reacting to media found in the everyday store, shop, or library	4
23781	4226	The innocence of the youth today is slowly being destroyed by the subliminal messages found in music, magazines, and movies	5
23782	4226	The messages are all the same in each type of media: sex, drugs, and violence	6
23783	4226	The world of music has evolved so much over the past decades of time	7
23784	4226	We go from jazz, disco, funk, rock, hard rock, to hip- hop/rap	8
23785	4226	All of these types belonging to a certain decade	9
23786	4226	But in our era, the music industry is exploding with rap and hip- hop music	10
23787	4226	This type of music is triggered towards the three ideas of sex, drugs, and violence	11
23788	4226	Almost every song that is heard today on the radio or on your iPod will most likely have something to do with one of those three	12
23789	4226	The sense of being so naive and so innocent is broken after listening to these songs everytime the radio is on	13
23790	4226	The youth does not need to be listening to this whatsoever and therefore, parents should be more aware about what their children are listening to and should think more about the effects that the media has on them	14
23791	4226	Recently, more and more people are turning to articles and segments of works to read instead of the 'good old fashioned' novels	15
23792	4226	The novels that were written before our era are clean and nonexplicit	16
23793	4226	But today, literature has gone down a new course	17
23794	4226	More and more, @ORGANIZATION1 companies are becoming less tradional and more upfront about topics that are sexual, violent, or drug related	18
23795	4226	For example, in @ORGANIZATION1, you will see articles strictly pretaining to sex-like actions	19
23796	4226	Possibly on the other side of the page, you will see an ad for @CAPS1 cigarettes	20
23797	4226	Soon enough, kids are going to think that everything they are seeing and looking at will be okay and soon act upon it	21
23798	4226	The libraries that are offering these magazines for rental should restrict children from reading them due to the lack of modesty and morals found in these magazines	22
23799	4226	There has always been a sense of subliminal messaging throughout the development and evolution in the cinematic world of movies	23
23800	4226	Movies are a timeless object of entertainment	24
23801	4226	But recently, the subtle or blunt 'hints' of sex, drugs, and violence is portayed in almost all movies offered in the box office today	25
23802	4226	There have been those action packed movies where there is all the fighting and the blood and the punching	26
23803	4226	Then there are the sappy movies where all it seems the main characters do is have emotional fights that are soon resolved by a session of steamy sexual actions	27
23804	4226	These types of movies are offered in libraries nationwide and are easily accessible to children	28
23805	4226	The youth of our country do not need to be seeing all of these actions and hearing these messages	29
23806	4226	In no way, shape, or form is this morally correct	30
23807	4226	All in all, library censorship is very weak	31
23808	4226	The people who organize and let this kind of media float around for kids to pick up have some moral issues that need to be checked	32
23809	4226	The more times a child reads, listens, or watches media with subliminal or blunt messages about sex, drugs, and violence, the more they are going to think it is okay to act and do these actions	33
23810	4226	All sense of innocence is destroyed and children are not children anymore	34
23811	4227	Why would you ever censor anything in a library	0
23812	4227	Apparently because things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect	1
23813	4227	can be found offensive	2
23814	4227	If something is considered offensive, why put it in a library anyway if its going to be open to anyone in the public, including children	3
23815	4227	First off, censorship is important but we don't need it in libraries of all places	4
23816	4227	Libraries is a place where all sorts of literature comes together in one place where it can be seen and read by those who admire literature	5
23817	4227	Censorship is stopping this by pulling books off shelfs because they are considered offensive	6
23818	4227	If a book is offensive, first decide what kind of audience it would be offensive to	7
23819	4227	Then decide whether or not it is offensive to even an adult audience	8
23820	4227	If it is found to be offensive to an adult audience, then it should be pulled off the shelves of a library	9
23821	4227	Otherwise it should be placed in the adult section of the library	10
23822	4227	Libraries should have certain sections for certain books and other pieces of literature	11
23823	4227	As mentioned before, if a book is too offensive for anyone not of adult audience, it should be placed in an adult section	12
23824	4227	Books that are suitable for children should be put in the children's section	13
23825	4227	You can even have a such section for young adults for books that are suitable for teenagers	14
23826	4227	Sections in a library almost completely defeats the need of censorship	15
23827	4227	Sections help correctly place books and other pieces of literature in a library so that onlt readers of certain suitable ages @MONTH1 read them	16
23828	4227	In conclusion, sections in a library can be used instead of censorship	17
23829	4227	If we were to censor what books were on the shelves in a library the eventually there will hardly any books for anybody	18
23830	4227	Sections help keep books in a library, but keeps them in a place where the right audience can view them	19
23831	4228	As a student at a public school, the libraries that I and many other students have access to are censored to an extent	0
23832	4228	With our library being censored I do not feel that the public library should be	1
23833	4228	Why is censorship a conflict in need of discussion	2
23834	4228	every book found on a shelf is a part of history so every author that was good enough to get published should be able to have their book on a shelf	3
23835	4228	While school libraries are already censored for their age group	4
23836	4228	I feel that public libraries should not be censored for the plain reason that you, your gaurdian, but also the library has control over what they find age appropriate	5
23837	4228	If disliking the book is a problem	6
23838	4228	then put it back	7
23839	4228	Find something more common towards your own interest	8
23840	4228	Some things @MONTH1 be considered inappropriate as many things are, but at the same time each person has their own limits to this	9
23841	4228	While someone @MONTH1 dislike a teen magazine because of how it effects youth, another @MONTH1 find it inspiring	10
23842	4228	If every person found a way to rate things according to their own taste, there would be nothing left on the shelves	11
23843	4228	as Katherine Paterson expressed in her quote	12
23844	4228	When you enter a public library	13
23845	4228	it is divided into sections according to interest, age, author, ect.	14
23846	4228	When you enter a school library it is done according to fiction, non-fiction and author	15
23847	4228	Censorship amoung public libraries is not needed	16
23848	4228	Adults, students, and childeren all go to a public library	17
23849	4228	So, as the case @MONTH1 be why would you censor a library that goes for all ages	18
23850	4228	I feel that yes an @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 school library should not contain the same content as a @CAPS3 school library	19
23851	4228	But a public library, is for the public	20
23852	4228	Hints the name	21
23853	4228	In conclusion, if even more censorship was done to public libraries, libraries would be used less than they already are	22
23854	4228	Some of the content in public libraries can't be found in school libraries, but also adults wouldn't be able to find the content needed for their own interests, jobs, or even schooling	23
23855	4228	So as the fact @MONTH1 be that some things @MONTH1 seem innappropriate to certain age groups, it can help someone in a completely different age group.	24
23856	4229	I personally believe that there shouldn't be a whole lot of censorship in libraries, except for things such as complete smut and pornography	0
23857	4229	However there are many different beliefs on this subject	1
23858	4229	Some parents @MONTH1 think it's necessary to control every bit of information a child takes in, while others are more forgiving	2
23859	4229	The main conflict with this issue is how different everyone's restrictions are	3
23860	4229	A lot of parents believe that if any politically incorrect information enters their child, he/she will be corrupted for life, but that is completely false	4
23861	4229	Nowadays, almost every single person goes through something traumatic, witnesses something illegal, gets involved in drama, experiments sexually, and/or experiments with drugs	5
23862	4229	The truth is, it's everywhere, and your kids have already experienced it and are used to it	6
23863	4229	Reading one book with a couple curse words here and there, or an intimate moment isn't going to ruin your child, because chances are, he/she is already doing it all in real life	7
23864	4229	It @MONTH1 even be happening in your own home and there is nothing that can be done to stop it	8
23865	4229	Trying to control our lives as if it was your own provokes kids to rebel even more when the chance arises	9
23866	4229	I say don't worry about censorship in libraries except for the obvious things like pornography, and sex novels, racist books,  ect	10
23867	4229	Maybe if we quit hiding so much from the more mature teenagers, and quit treating them like toddlers, they wouldn't go looking as much for all of the 'bad' things out there	11
23868	4229	Parents need to quit thinking they can get their child to believe there is nothing bad in the world	12
23869	4229	If they aren't aware of the mistakes that can be made and the consequences from it, they won't know what to do if they find themselves in a similar situation as one of the characters in one of these 'offensive' books	13
23870	4230	Offensive @CAPS1     @CAPS1	0
23871	4230	Books, music, magazines, movies, commericals	1
23872	4230	Is it right to have all types of @CAPS1 shown to all ages	2
23873	4230	I disagree	3
23874	4230	A variety of people could take offense to the content this @CAPS1 contains	4
23875	4230	I think that there should be a designated area, or all the alarming @CAPS1 should be removed so everyone can be at peace when they are at the library, or just watching television in their own home	5
23876	4230	Even though some people @MONTH1 not take offense to any type of @CAPS1, you have to think about the parents	6
23877	4230	A majority of parents would not want their children to be surrounded by all the effects that this @CAPS1 brings	7
23878	4230	Some content @MONTH1 not be suitable to younger kids	8
23879	4230	Whether it be going to the movies or just going to the library, children can see all the violence and misbehaving going on in the world today	9
23880	4230	I believe that drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big influence on kids these days	10
23881	4230	I think it is our responsibilty to protect them until they are at an age they can make their own judgements	11
23882	4230	Religion	12
23883	4230	Our religion plays a big part on what we think is right or wrong	13
23884	4230	I was taught to always treat people with respect and to try my hardest to get along with others	14
23885	4230	A lot of the @CAPS1 contradicts what I have been taught	15
23886	4230	If you see something on television with your favorite actor or actress on it, we tend to believe it is acceptable behavior	16
23887	4230	If you have ever been to a movie theater, you know they have certain ratings	17
23888	4230	The ratings are there to protect younger kids from getting into adult movies	18
23889	4230	They enforce this rule to an extent, but I don't think they enforce it enough	19
23890	4230	At the least, libraries and movie rental places could have a designated area for adult rated content to respect those who disagree	20
23891	4230	A few years ago when my little sister was about two or three, she was watching a movie with me and it had a few curse words in it	21
23892	4230	She had never heard them that often and wasn't sure what they meant	22
23893	4230	For the next couple of days, she went around saying the word and my parents weren't very happy	23
23894	4230	She had no idea she was doing anything wrong because she heard it on a movie and if they could say it, then she could too	24
23895	4230	Children sometimes don't know any better and if they would happen to say it to a stranger, they would be offended	25
23896	4230	@CAPS1 can be harmless, but it can also be offensive	26
23897	4230	The safest way to keep the new generation respectful, is to shield them when they are young so that they can learn what is right and what is wrong	27
23898	4230	When they come out into the real world, they won't be difficult to put up with and will have proper manners	28
23899	4230	No one will ever agree on the same things, but in the end, we need to do what is right for the betterment of our community.	29
23900	4232	When you go into a library have you ever seen the many subjects people write about	0
23901	4232	Some from their own experience and some made up	1
23902	4232	I personally disagree that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed	2
23903	4232	The authors or producer of these sort of entertainment were made to be read, hear or watched by people that are interested in them	3
23904	4232	Also if the libraries are having diffculties with the complainments towards the offensive materials they should just make a separate section	4
23905	4232	To begin with, why are books, music, movies, and magazines produced for	5
23906	4232	Easy one	6
23907	4232	To entertain us	7
23908	4232	to expand our knowledge on things	8
23909	4232	to let us have intrest	9
23910	4232	If none of these things were invented, life would be boring, now i'm not saying we need these offensive materials, i'm saying it's there so we can think bigger about topics instead of them same-o-same-o	10
23911	4232	Producer produced 'offensive' material to catch attention and to be read, not so they can sit on the far back of library where nobody goes just because it has some things others @MONTH1 not like	11
23912	4232	If you don't like those type of things, stay away from them, don't bother reading or listening to them	12
23913	4232	Why should libraries stop the people that made those things from making money	13
23914	4232	Does that seem right to you	14
23915	4232	It's bad enough they're sencond guessing if they're good enough to be shelve worthy	15
23916	4232	There's many books out there that are horible and a waste of time reading it, so should they be removed to	16
23917	4232	Think about that one	17
23918	4232	Secondly, I disagree with the removal of these type of materials because libraries could always make a separate section	18
23919	4232	It @MONTH1 cost money, but what's more better loosing tons of costermers or finding extra room	19
23920	4232	Libraries are very big already and i'm sure they could find a little bit more room, they separate everything into genres already	20
23921	4232	Although I see where others come from about removing these kinds of  materials from shelves	21
23922	4232	There @MONTH1 be some cautious parents that don't want their children exposed to that sort of stuff	22
23923	4232	Teenagers especially, they @MONTH1 get ideas of the language and scenes from these sort of stuff	23
23924	4232	I once read a story about a man that read a book one of his old pals from college wrote about killing women and teering there inside out, this man got a idea to do it to his mother	24
23925	4232	He beat his mom and cut her body open, leaving the insides on the outside lawn	25
23926	4232	The man is in jail now and the book was removed from shelves	26
23927	4232	Still I don't think it should have been removed because an imature, ignorate person thought it would be cool to do it	27
23928	4232	The book was made up and the guy was most likely dellusional and sick in the head to do it	28
23929	4232	And because of his actions and author has to suffer from money lost and big waste of his time and effort he put into it	29
23930	4232	In conclusion no type of material should be removed because it has been found offensive	30
23931	4232	Some people just have ignorance to not understand the books, music or movies was made for entertainment for those who like that kind of stuff exposed	31
23932	4232	Like i've said recently it was made to be either read	32
23933	4232	heard	33
23934	4232	or watched	34
23935	4232	A separate section would be a great idea.	35
23936	4233	All terms of offense are based on an opinion	0
23937	4233	If one person finds a particular word offensive, doesn't mean the next guy will feel the same way	1
23938	4233	Some parents aren't as strict on there kids as others, and some just dont care	2
23939	4233	Of course there's always that gangster rap that talks about drugs and women being objectified that kids really dont need to belistening to	3
23940	4233	The horror movies that are rater ''@CAPS1' for a reason, they could have nightmare for weeks	4
23941	4233	Children's mental states aren't fully developed at a young age like ten	5
23942	4233	They still cant tell whats real and whats not	6
23943	4233	They need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel, to act, to do, even to think	7
23944	4233	Children just are't mature enough to handle a mojority of material in this world	8
23945	4233	No books should be taken away or hiddne fvrom society, it should just be given to you at your own disgression	9
23946	4233	Another possiblility would be have a group of many people gather and vote on age restrictions for particualr material	10
23947	4233	All information is helpful, just not all is necessary	11
23948	4233	These days its hard to hide all harmful material from children, even some teenagers	12
23949	4233	This wolrd is becoming less and less sensitive everyday	13
23950	4233	Eventually everyone will be completly insensitive to all 'harmful' movies, books ,amgazines, @CAPS2 shows, and music	14
23951	4233	It wont even phase anyone anymore.	15
23952	4234	Censorship in libraries is something good to have and something bad to have	0
23953	4234	I think that there could be some things adults can read and some things kids can read	1
23954	4234	You don't want the kids reading anything thats too mature for them right	2
23955	4234	Libraries are found all over the @LOCATION1	3
23956	4234	A lot of people say, '@CAPS1, well they shouldn't even have the book there in the first place.' @CAPS2 think about this, maybe you should just have your kid under control and watch what they read	4
23957	4234	Or option two, dont have your kid go to a @CAPS3 library	5
23958	4234	@CAPS3, which let me explain, is @CAPS3	6
23959	4234	Which means the whole community can go pick out something	7
23960	4234	A @CAPS3 library is suppose to have a variety so anybody can find a book they would like to read	8
23961	4234	Yes some things are very inappropriate for kids, doesn't mean we can't have it in a @CAPS3 library	9
23962	4234	Just make sure that you know what your kid reads	10
23963	4234	If you do that you should be fine, and your kid will be the same	11
23964	4234	That's how i feel about censorship in a library	12
23965	4234	Its @CAPS3, so it's meant to have everything	13
23966	4234	Which everything includes the good and the bad	14
23967	4234	I think some people just have to live with it	15
23968	4234	So I honestly feel that libraries for the way they are is to be left alone.	16
23969	4235	Has anyone ever stopped and thought about the negative aspects of censoring a book	0
23970	4235	Many people of different beliefs take offense to books that show negativity to their ideas	1
23971	4235	When people are offended by a book the first idea that comes to mind is to try and get the book off the shelves by censoring it from libraries	2
23972	4235	I think that if a book offends a certain group of people they should just simply not read it	3
23973	4235	Why should other people not get a chance to read a good book just because it offends someone else	4
23974	4235	Banning books would go against what our country stands for	5
23975	4235	How different would it make us if we started censoring books in our libraries like other countries with governments who have the final say on what can and can not be read	6
23976	4235	Imagine what life would be like if all books found offensive were stripped from our shelves	7
23977	4235	there would be nothing left because anyone can find something offensive in any book	8
23978	4235	I understand that sometimes things written in books can really be disturbing ,and offensive but that doesnt give anyone the right to just take it off the shelves	9
23979	4235	Censoring books is a short term answer to a long term problem	10
23980	4235	I believe that if we always resort to censoring books then we will become a less creative society	11
23981	4235	There are many people who @MONTH1 actually want to read a book but never get chance just because it is censored from library	12
23982	4235	Books that are censored are usually the books that help ones imagination	13
23983	4235	Would you want to live in a world where people are void of creativity?	14
23984	4238	I have read a few books that I dont approve of	0
23985	4238	And I feel that yes i do have a right to remove these books from the shelves	1
23986	4238	But whose to say what i think should have an affect	2
23987	4238	Honestly i do not think that books should be taking off the shelves or music should be banned ect..	3
23988	4238	I think that there should be a little more athority on the age limit of books in libraries, and a seperate place for music and other things of that nature	4
23989	4238	I would not want my kid to walk out of the library with a book about sex, gangs, or stuff that should not be known by a kid	5
23990	4238	Instead of banning or removing these kinds of books off shelves why not put a strict age limit on books, and actually stand by it	6
23991	4238	Yes there is an adult section a kids section ect.., but i've seen so many young kids walking out with books magazines and other adult items	7
23992	4238	I know how it feels to try and concentrate on a book newspaper or magazine you are interested in when people are blareing there head phones	8
23993	4238	And i still feel the same way about the music as i do with books	9
23994	4238	Dont bann it from the library just bann it from certain areas of the library	10
23995	4238	Its all out of respect to people who are wanting to be in a quiet area	11
23996	4238	Im not the type of person who wants to take things away from people because everyone has there own interests and beliefs in life, but i am one who believes in setting rules that should be followed	12
23997	4238	I see good comming out of everything a library has to offer if only they could exclude things in certain areas	13
23998	4238	And also set and stand by the age limits of the books being checked out.	14
23999	4241	Censorship in libraries	0
24000	4241	Is it a problem	1
24001	4241	Should we fix this 'problem' or is it for the good	2
24002	4241	People of different culture, background, and life could be profound by these articles in readings	3
24003	4241	Can these books be offensive	4
24004	4241	They could be offensive to some but to others only educational	5
24005	4241	Statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong	6
24006	4241	How many people believe that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries	7
24007	4241	Who really are the victims when books and magazines are being thrown off the shelves	8
24008	4241	The author of that specific article that's who	9
24009	4241	If it is said that every reading that comes off offensive should be taken off the shelves, then what would be left on them	10
24010	4241	Some people @MONTH1 take romances being offensive or comedy or horror	11
24011	4241	Romance could be hurtful to someone only because they maybe just got out of an relationship, or comedy because they are miserable and don't know how to laugh anymore or know what happiness is	12
24012	4241	Who knows	13
24013	4241	Opinions such as these would be only terrible for business but also terrible for the educational and history part of life itself	14
24014	4241	People of different races and cultures @MONTH1 have another opinion on the situation of censorship	15
24015	4241	From all over the world there are cultures spreading throughout	16
24016	4241	Born into a religion could be a huge affect on what their outcome is on a book, magazine, or a movie	17
24017	4241	Movies of past experiences or massacres that happened to a cultrue @MONTH1 be difficult for some people of that culture to take in	18
24018	4241	The normal response to a movie such as that would be to become angry or frustrated	19
24019	4241	Only for others it is an oppertunity to learn what those people went through and grieve for the loss of the people during that time	20
24020	4241	To support the people who made it through those heart breaking times and become a friend to them and learn more about them, their culture, and way of life	21
24021	4241	Have you seen protests arouse before you	22
24022	4241	Anywhere in the world	23
24023	4241	On television, hear it on the radio, or see it in the newspaper	24
24024	4241	Everyone has most likely seen this type of protest or attack on the opinion of another person	25
24025	4241	There have been protest in the past of the freedoms of a person or even race	26
24026	4241	If everyone begins to complain and argue of what is being put on shelves in libraries	27
24027	4241	What will come of our world	28
24028	4241	What will we know about the past	29
24029	4241	What will we begin to predict for the future	30
24030	4241	Anyone, and even I can make observations of the acts going on around us	31
24031	4241	In my experience, I have seen of attacks being struck upon people who only put a picture in the newspaper, or a small article spoke out on television	32
24032	4241	Who are we to say that everything needs to be removed off the shelves in libraries	33
24033	4241	These are just people who have been hurt and don't want to relive that experience	34
24034	4241	Overall, my opinion on if censorship in libraries should be extinguished	35
24035	4241	I believe the answer is no, every person in the world is going to be upset, hurt, or broken about something at least a million times in their life time from now on	36
24036	4241	Whether it be in books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else	37
24037	4241	They just need to understand that without any one person's culture that there would be no history of life before us	38
24038	4242	We as @CAPS1 have the right to say what we want, and do as long as it is within the laws	0
24039	4242	If they take away some books because they are racey or because some people find them wrong, then they are saying we shouldn't learn the history of our civilization	1
24040	4242	A great man once said '@CAPS2 who do not learn from the past are condemed to repeat it.' @CAPS3 is saying that if we take away the books that are even obscured we are taking that history away from our children and they will do the same mistakes that we have done in our lifes	2
24041	4242	Taking away the content that is obsene will make our children unknowledgable to the fact that it happened or how the past really was	3
24042	4242	'@CAPS4 @CAPS5's @CAPS6' is under critism because it uses the '@CAPS7-word' alot in the text	4
24043	4242	There is no reason to change the book because that is how the people talked, back in the day, and how things were done	5
24044	4242	If they change the book they change history and they take away knowledge from the children of tomorrow that slavery was a harsh, harsh thing	6
24045	4242	When I think of censorship in the library, I think of how the @ORGANIZATION1 is trying to change the past and how it is trying to nurf the childrens history of what really happened	7
24046	4242	Censorshiop should be on tv, movies, and music so the little kids dont see the wrong things to earl, but when it comes to lititure in the library they shouldn't do it at all because only the liturate people will know what it means and what the text is actually saying	8
24047	4242	There should not be a censhorship in the lititure of the past, the present, and the future.	9
24048	4244	I believe that everyone's opinion deserves to be publicized fairly	0
24049	4244	Just because one person's view is considered to be right, doesn't mean another is wrong	1
24050	4244	What is offensive to one person @MONTH1 be informative to another	2
24051	4244	I've read a lot of books that parents @MONTH1 not pick out for their children	3
24052	4244	In reading these books I see that there is no glamour in doing drugs or getting in trouble with the law	4
24053	4244	For some teens, books like these can show them the side of life they haven't experienced and find that they never want to	5
24054	4244	If a book is too explicit for children, simply place the book in another section	6
24055	4244	I realize that there are books with graphic sexual details, and those should only be premitted to be checked out by adults	7
24056	4244	Parents should have concerns about their children's innocence	8
24057	4244	But I also believe that they should watch over what type of books they're reading too monitor the vulgarity of them	9
24058	4244	Some @CAPS1 contain profanity or sexual induendoes, some contain praise and worship, others even have screaming	10
24059	4244	Any of thses type of musics can be found offensive by someone	11
24060	4244	That doesn't mean to run off and hide all of them	12
24061	4244	There'd be no @CAPS1 left	13
24062	4244	Not everyone shares the same opnions in this world, therefore there should be equal opportunity for people to read,watch, or listen to whatever suits them	14
24063	4244	I'm not saying that there should be a stock of porn in the library, but if there are movies or books about shunned religions or beliefs then they should be just as welcomed as the ones about common religions and beliefs	15
24064	4244	Everyone finds different things offensive	16
24065	4244	If there was a bible in the library and someone found it offensive, should it be removed	17
24066	4244	It's one of the most popular books in the world, yet some people still find offense by it	18
24067	4244	Someone who is mormon, muslim, or athiest might find offensive if there is nothing in the library about them because some people find it offensive	19
24068	4244	The library is a place of knowledge, not judgement	20
24069	4244	I dont't believe that certain books should be removed from the library if they offend someone	21
24070	4244	If you don't like something that is at the library, don't rent it	22
24071	4244	If you don't want your children to, don't let them	23
24072	4244	Simple as that	24
24073	4244	Everyone is entiled to freedom of speech	25
24074	4244	Authors express themselves through books and articles, directors through movies, and musicians through their music.	26
24075	4246	Every parent wants to protect their child's innocence	0
24076	4246	They do not want their children to come in contact with things that might influence their decisions	1
24077	4246	The truth is though that they are going to run into these types of things eventually, whether it be from other kids at school, what they see on television, or what they see on the @CAPS1	2
24078	4246	It is their choice as of what decisions they are going to make, so I do not think libraries should be censored due to the content of the material	3
24079	4246	One reason libraries should not be censored is because nobody is forcing a person to pick up material that might have offensive content	4
24080	4246	It is all about choices	5
24081	4246	There are a lot of other options on the shelves that do not include such topics	6
24082	4246	Some people @MONTH1 want to read or watch something with such content	7
24083	4246	Taking these pieces out of libraries would not be fair to them	8
24084	4246	People should have the option to read or watch what they wish	9
24085	4246	Censoring libraries would take away these people's right to such topics	10
24086	4246	Another reason libraries should not be censored is that eventually nothing would be left	11
24087	4246	As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 is a very true statement	12
24088	4246	After one censoring, people might still think topics are inappropiate, and the libraries would have to be censored again and again until there is nothing left	13
24089	4246	People eventually will not be able to use libraries	14
24090	4246	Losing libraries as an option will cause people to lose their right to that resource	15
24091	4246	A final reason that libraries should be left uncensored is the difference of opinions	16
24092	4246	What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person might not be to another	17
24093	4246	How would what should be gotten rid of and what should not be decided	18
24094	4246	It would be much easier to just leave the people to make their own decisions on what okay to read and watch and what is not	19
24095	4246	Nobody is forcing people to pick up a book or magazine that is going to offend them	20
24096	4246	If you do not like what is being discussed, do not read or watch it	21
24097	4246	It is as simple as that	22
24098	4246	There are many more reasons libraries' content should not be censored, but here are three reasons that are obvious	23
24099	4246	Censoring libraries are going to eliminate a person's choice	24
24100	4246	It will cause problems, as to what is appropiate and what is not	25
24101	4246	Eventually libraries will have nothing left	26
24102	4246	Of course every parent wants to protect their child, but eventually they are going to grow up and have to make their own choices	27
24103	4246	Censoring libraries is not going to stop children from learning about offensive things	28
24104	4246	All you can do as a parent is raise them well and hope that you have taught them right from wrong.	29
24105	4248	Everyone loves to take their little children to the library and pick out all kinds of book to to read, but what if your child picks up that one book that, lets say just isn't want you want them reading	0
24106	4248	Then what do you do	1
24107	4248	Take the book from them	2
24108	4248	Look for more and just let it let	3
24109	4248	Well you cannot blame the library for having the book	4
24110	4248	Or say you see books you do not like on the shelve at @ORGANIZATION1	5
24111	4248	Not only books but music or movies	6
24112	4248	Even if you find it offensive, someone else might not	7
24113	4248	It should not be a big issue at all because not everyone thinks alike, some of those books, music, or movies could have great information for others, and also every book, music, or movie has its purpose	8
24114	4248	Although you @MONTH1 not see it everytime it is something that you do not like	9
24115	4248	Wow, the world would be SO boring if everyone liked the same music, read the same books, or just watched the same movie over and over again	10
24116	4248	Eveyone has the right to chose what they like and enjoy watching, reading or listening to	11
24117	4248	The libraries and stores also should have the right to put whatever they want on their shelves	12
24118	4248	Yes, somethings are not approite for others, such as yonuger kids but it does not matter	13
24119	4248	You as a parent should do your best to keep them away from those things you do not want them to see or hear	14
24120	4248	Another thing is that just because you do not like something or think it is stupid does not mean that another person does not love it	15
24121	4248	Not your averge teenage girl is going to want to read about building a house or listen to music from the @NUM1's, but does that mean that stores should not sale them	16
24122	4248	Everyone has a different taste, just like in music	17
24123	4248	Most younger kids these days are starting to listen to the fast rap music	18
24124	4248	That their parents swear up and down you cannot understand	19
24125	4248	Although in relatity some of those songs have great meaning to us teenagers	20
24126	4248	Lastly every song, book, or movie has a meaning	21
24127	4248	Not everyone will see the meaning but it is there	22
24128	4248	Everyone has their own opinoin	23
24129	4248	Librarys or stores should not take things off their selves just because one person thinks that it is unapporite.	24
24130	4249	I believe that people should not be able to remove books, movies, magazines, etc	0
24131	4249	from shelfs of the libraires	1
24132	4249	If someone takes a movie, book or magazine offensive they should contact the auother of the pieace and can complain or give their thoughts	2
24133	4249	Even if someone does find someones work in a wrong way, people have their own opionons and thoughts about everthing in life and are allowed to voice their bellifs and disbeilfs	3
24134	4249	Also, people can read on the front or back of other peoples work which summarize what the work is going to be about or what the work is talking about	4
24135	4249	People can decide then if the would like to read or watch further into it	5
24136	4249	Everyone in this country is allowed to say what they think and if someone takes the time to get their voice published then others might want to hear what others think	6
24137	4249	People can disagree, no one has to agree with anything anyone says	7
24138	4249	It is alright to not agree with another person says but everyone does have the right to stand up and say what they think about the situation	8
24139	4249	For example if my coaches were to tell me that they think im doing something wrong in gymnastics or they think something doesn't look good when I do, I let them speak	9
24140	4249	I let them tell me what they think would look better or would give more points	10
24141	4249	Then after they're done talking I give my thoughts and say '@CAPS1 I think this because this' I try to reason with them	11
24142	4249	For one its more respectful and for two everyone can have their own thought about something	12
24143	4249	And who knows they actually might be right if you give them a chance to speak	13
24144	4249	But, if you really don't like what another pieace of work might say you can always not read what they wrote, or watch what they produced	14
24145	4249	There is no need to be rude	15
24146	4249	If you strongly diagree you can always write your own book or publish an article voicing your own thoughts, that way someone can diagree or agree with how you feel about a certain subject	16
24147	4249	That is why I feel that they should keep all books, magaiznes, movies on shelfs	17
24148	4249	Everyone is allowed to express themselves and explain their actions toward a certain matter	18
24149	4249	Sincerly,                                                                         @PERSON1	19
24150	4250	To whom it @MONTH1 concern:     The idea of censoring books, music, movies, or anything else from libraries or from the public eye is very offensive	0
24151	4250	There are many things that could come off as 'offensive' to any individual	1
24152	4250	Taking books or anything off the shelf because someone felt that it did not go with their certain morals or beliefs is against the writer's freedom of speech	2
24153	4250	It also can start serious issues with feuding religious groups or persons of different ideas	3
24154	4250	This also shows that the library, or so far as the country, is under one certain idea and other ideas that conflict with that will be oppressed	4
24155	4250	One of the biggest concerns is that the freedom of speech is taken away	5
24156	4250	It @MONTH1 be something as trivial as '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' now, but if people keep taking books off the shelf because they find something wrong with it, then our freedom is taken away	6
24157	4250	'@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' was brought up because a mother had actually gotten a certain book of the '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' @CAPS4 taken off the shelf, because her child had gotten scared of the halloween edition	7
24158	4250	The fact that something could be banned for something so trivial is a frightening thought	8
24159	4250	There weren't many cases of this specific @PERSON1 scene scaring all the kids, so there was no need to get it banned	9
24160	4250	When someone finds something even a tad wrong they want it banned and thrown away, never again allowed to be shown to those that @MONTH1 even find an interest in it	10
24161	4250	A big thing that @MONTH1 conflict with censorship is the idea of religion	11
24162	4250	The @CAPS5 is a published work, whether it is religious or not	12
24163	4250	Who's to say that it can't be banned	13
24164	4250	What if someone of a different religion found it highly offensive	14
24165	4250	This could cause even more conflicts between religious parties, and in turn anything religious would be banned all together	15
24166	4250	That small, faint line between state and religion is going to get blurred solely from censorship	16
24167	4250	If the @CAPS5 or works for catholics get banned, then so could published works for wiccans, muslims, buddhists, and any other sources of religion	17
24168	4250	There would be nothing for a religious or spiritual person to find comfort in	18
24169	4250	Not to mention the fear some publishers or authors will have in publishing their works	19
24170	4250	It will then become a topic far less talked about, for they would be afraid of getting into legal or social trouble for expressing their thoughts and feelings with their spirituality or religion	20
24171	4250	This censorship will only cause future issues	21
24172	4250	This could lead to not only the religious books being banned, but anything that strays from the social norms	22
24173	4250	If someone was homophobic, they @MONTH1 start having a gay author's works banned, or just a book about the @CAPS7 community banned	23
24174	4250	That small sense of security those in that community have in those books will be taken away	24
24175	4250	Personally, I find comfort and my sense of being alone is dulled by these books	25
24176	4250	There @MONTH1 even be a possibility that some books, not necessarily just @CAPS7 books, hold someone up from that pit of depression they are so close to	26
24177	4250	It is a world someone loves to enter, to hide or confide in	27
24178	4250	To take someone's mental safety is worse than taking their physical safety	28
24179	4250	Most people do not realize what sort of trouble they will start with censorship	29
24180	4250	It @MONTH1 mean nothing, but those that decide whether or not to censor something have to think of the picture at large	30
24181	4250	Do they lose customers for keeping it on the shelf	31
24182	4250	Or do they lose customers, and stop giving the rights of freedom of speech	32
24183	4250	It is a heavy decision to make but the decision could make or break the publishing group or legal party	33
24184	4251	Devin @NUM1 @NUM2                                   @CAPS1 @CAPS2    Do you like the libary	0
24185	4251	There is always an argument about how books, music, movies, magazines, ete., should be removed from the shelves if people find them offensive	1
24186	4251	Which brings me to @CAPS1 @CAPS2	2
24187	4251	there is always the choice of a different libary to choose from	3
24188	4251	You also don't have to look at the book or watch the movie	4
24189	4251	Being an @CAPS3 author you have the freedom of speech, you can write whatever you feel like writing	5
24190	4251	First, is your choice of libary	6
24191	4251	There is sevral different libraries in one town	7
24192	4251	Some have childern sections, where all the books are appropriate for young childern to read	8
24193	4251	Also the parents of the childern need to keep an eye on what their child will be reading, or looking at	9
24194	4251	There has to be at least twenty to thirty libaries in @LOCATION1, so you always have a different option	10
24195	4251	Second, you don't have to read the book, or watch the movie	11
24196	4251	If you see something you don't like about the book, why complain about it	12
24197	4251	Just put the book down, someone else might be interested in the book	13
24198	4251	You have the freedom to pick out the book	14
24199	4251	Last, is the freedom of speech of the author of the book	15
24200	4251	Being an @CAPS3 citizen you have the right to write down whatever you want to write down	16
24201	4251	So people do not have the right to blame the author for what he or she writes down	17
24202	4251	Many people have been inspired by certain books that throughout history have been controversial	18
24203	4251	Where would we be without those books and authors	19
24204	4251	I have given you three reasons on @CAPS1 view of censorship in libraries	20
24205	4251	You have the choice of libraries, you don't have to read the book, and the author has the freedom to write what they choose	21
24206	4252	Hiding @CAPS1	0
24207	4252	By: @PERSON1 to the harsh world we all live in, I do not believe it is morally correct for a program, of any kind, to hide the hard reality of our world from any person	1
24208	4252	@CAPS1 will be @CAPS1 and one shouldn't ever hide what is true from the eyes of another person's mind	2
24209	4252	If one person makes the choice to close his eyes and go into a fantasy world then that is one person's right as a human being	3
24210	4252	However, one man has no right- whats so ever- to close the eyes of another person for them	4
24211	4252	Personally, I myself am not afraid to look into the history of man's choices and take upon myself the burden of the harsh knowledge that I have inherited	5
24212	4252	I look at the human race of this planet to be whole and to be one with another	6
24213	4252	This planet doesn't belong to one race, nation or culture of people	7
24214	4252	it belongs to every single person equally	8
24215	4252	I made the decision to take on the resonsibility to know the past and use it's lessons to better the future	9
24216	4252	This world belongs to me as equally as it belongs to you	10
24217	4252	so my decisions will affect you as much as they affect me	11
24218	4252	That being stated, every person's decisions impact everyone, not just one's self	12
24219	4252	People think that we should hide things that are 'offensive' to other people	13
24220	4252	Racism, world political issues, casualties of war and personal ethics- are some of these 'offensive' things	14
24221	4252	However, offensive or not, these subjects are very real and very much alive in our world	15
24222	4252	So why should anyone have the right to try to make these subjects dissappear for another person	16
24223	4252	In @LOCATION1, everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression, but how can these freedoms be carried through if people remove these expressed ideas and beliefs from the shelves of the readers	17
24224	4252	We all have a right to make the decisions that affect our world and if this world is equally owned by everyone, then everyone's decisions are equally burdened by everyone	18
24225	4252	That being said, we all have the right to know the decisions, actions, and the concequencies of these decisions and actions that our people all create every single day	19
24226	4252	In conclusion, I believe that our world is harsh and also beautiful	20
24227	4252	Being that of which it is, I believe it is every man's right to live and decide the way he wants to	21
24228	4252	No man should ever make another person's decisions for them	22
24229	4252	Everyone is resonsible for their own life and how their life affects other people	23
24230	4252	However, no one has responsibility to hide or change the world around us from any person, for it is the knowledge of the people that make the world what it is and it is the knowledge of the world that influences a person's decisions	24
24231	4254	Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions	0
24232	4254	I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content	1
24233	4254	Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things	2
24234	4254	Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someones development	3
24235	4254	First off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means	4
24236	4254	There is a reason these books have been written and published nad it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise	5
24237	4254	Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way	6
24238	4254	Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong	7
24239	4254	If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves	8
24240	4254	If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating	9
24241	4254	When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong	10
24242	4254	Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @CAPS1 at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner	11
24243	4254	Movies now a days have come along way	12
24244	4254	Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago	13
24245	4254	Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that	14
24246	4254	This does not mean that these things should be removed from the @CAPS1 though	15
24247	4254	In all honesty I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that	16
24248	4254	Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though	17
24249	4254	Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content	18
24250	4254	Movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape	19
24251	4254	Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time	20
24252	4254	I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent	21
24253	4254	Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path	22
24254	4254	In the world today we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while	23
24255	4254	I feel like some educational magazines @MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand	24
24256	4254	Now I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that @MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1	25
24257	4254	They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week	26
24258	4254	Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach	27
24259	4254	It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them	28
24260	4254	Once again pornography should not be available at anytime but other magazines that have an educational aproach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard	29
24261	4254	Magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music	30
24262	4254	Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today	31
24263	4254	People use music to express feelings	32
24264	4254	Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song	33
24265	4254	Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time	34
24266	4254	Music should not be taken away from people going into a @CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter	35
24267	4254	There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it	36
24268	4254	Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can undertstns why they are taken off the sheleves but other than that I think everything should be made available	37
24269	4254	Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do	38
24270	4254	In conclusion the censorship should not be done	39
24271	4254	Yes there are somethings that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained in it but if things can be learned from I feel like it should stay no matter what	40
24272	4254	People go to a @CAPS1 to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them	41
24273	4254	Music, movies, magazines, and books can be such a big part of peoples lives and taking these things from them is not right	42
24274	4255	Have you ever been reading something that made you mad	0
24275	4255	Well, to be honest I can't remember the last time I walk into a librarie and found something there that could had offended somebody	1
24276	4255	But thats just me, I'm sure that there is stuff out there that could really get to a person	2
24277	4255	No, I don't that materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	3
24278	4255	People go to libraries to find out information on stuff that they don't know	4
24279	4255	If you are checking something out then you already know that there is a possibility of something that you don't agree with	5
24280	4255	I think it should be anybody business than the person checking it out	6
24281	4255	Now, I'm not the type to get all frustrated or upset from something that I have seen on a shelve, but I could image that there are people out that are like that	7
24282	4255	If I had found something that I disagreed with I would not read it or just think nothing of it	8
24283	4255	I also think that you should be prepared before walking into a public place where they have all kinds of reading material	9
24284	4255	To you it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to others its hilarious	10
24285	4255	All I'm trying to say just do'n get all upset over something that you have read.	11
24286	4256	I believe books are writen for a reason and the words in the book goes with  the whole point of the book is the words in the book are ment to be in the book	0
24287	4256	But I am also the kind of person who sees words that are to offensive for people to read	1
24288	4256	But no by far I  think not letting people read the books that has offensive wording in it is kinda off silly because the author ment for it to be in there and if you change one word you kind of are changing the whole book and whats its trying to say	2
24289	4256	But if some books are to offensive yes i believe it is good to not let people read but to take it off the market and exit the book and and try to resale it	3
24290	4256	But some people would be upset about the changes we make because they will think that the book is saying  something different but its not it is just worded differently	4
24291	4256	But i believe in both not to stop letting people reading them and for them to stay on market	5
24292	4256	Why I think its good to let books like this go on books that had offensive wording in it yes its worng but its also worng for the people who dont see it as being a offensive	6
24293	4256	Am sure the author of any book that has offensive wording in it didnt mean for it to hurt you	7
24294	4256	Am i know in my heart that they are sorry for hurting you in anyway	8
24295	4256	But why I think they should stop is because some people would really have a hard time reading offensive wroding  it could be about  something that happend to them when they are little or just a word maybe they just dislike	9
24296	4256	But if they come across any word they dont like they  should stop reading	10
24297	4256	I believe it is very unfare if they take a book away just because there might be one word someone dont like	11
24298	4256	But to others its does nothing to them	12
24299	4256	I think books that have a offensive wording should say somewhere like on the back of the book it should have a warning if it has any offensive working in it I think this would help out alot of people would start doing that	13
24300	4256	This is really kind of silly because a book is a book and you should alway read about the story on the back of the book and if its a offensive and you dont like it that tells you not to buy the book	14
24301	4256	Dont always buy a book by the cover because the cover could be with flowers on the front of it and the book might not be about flowers at all	15
24302	4256	I really feel like am on both sides	16
24303	4257	Libraries are a center of learning	0
24304	4257	They are there to provide all kinds of different information	1
24305	4257	So why should you take out offensive material	2
24306	4257	Even before internet, the all knowing source, people depended on the libarary for research	3
24307	4257	I do not think that things should be taken out of our library	4
24308	4257	Public libraries have always had a good censory about @CAPS1 they put on their shelves anyway	5
24309	4257	As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	6
24310	4257	But if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	7
24311	4257	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 she is saying there is, everybody has a certain opinion, they @MONTH1 take offense to different things	8
24312	4257	Therefore, if anyone could have the right to take a book off the shelf that they found offensive, then we wouldn't have any books on our shelves	9
24313	4257	If we would travel back to the time where internet was not invented, there would not be a problem on whether we should take certain books off the shelf	10
24314	4257	That's all they depended on	11
24315	4257	For example, research and entertainment	12
24316	4257	People today are spoiled	13
24317	4257	We can go right to a little screen and type in anything we want to know and we can find out just in mintues, sometimes even seconds	14
24318	4257	People don't even have to leave the house to go buy the latest movie that just came out, you can order it on the internet or even rent it from @ORGANIZATION1	15
24319	4257	If people are so worried about @CAPS1 is in the library, why don't they worry about all the explicit junk on the internet	16
24320	4257	Sometimes people can't see @CAPS1's right in front of them	17
24321	4257	Everytime I go to the library and look through the books to find something to read, I rarely find a book that's worth questioning	18
24322	4257	Libraries are typically wholesome corporations, they have a good censory on @CAPS1 they let on their shelves	19
24323	4257	They've always had certain age group sections, and usually people and kids always stick to their age groups	20
24324	4257	Every book I have choosen too, I've read it cover to cover	21
24325	4257	In conclusion, libraries have been around for ever	22
24326	4257	Their material provides research and appropriate entertainment for all ages	23
24327	4257	No matter if we ever had internet, we always had dependable libraries.	24
24328	4260	Let's say you walk into a public library and you look upon a book that is racist or is offensive to you	0
24329	4260	You believe that the book shouldn't be on the shelf so you take it off	1
24330	4260	I believe that you have the right to take that book off the shelf	2
24331	4260	It isn't just books either	3
24332	4260	it can be music, movies, magazine, or many others	4
24333	4260	The authors have the right of freedom of speech but it can go the other way around too	5
24334	4260	There are many reasons why and I will explain this to you	6
24335	4260	The first reason why is that the person might not come back to that place	7
24336	4260	I mean if somebody walks into a library and trys to find a book to read, do you think they will ever come back if they are offended by one	8
24337	4260	A little while back, I was in the library and I noticed a book that was offending	9
24338	4260	It was talking jokes about black people	10
24339	4260	I believe that isn't right because all people are equal no matter how they look or what they believe	11
24340	4260	The next reason is that it could cause rate of the materials to go down	12
24341	4260	If somebody gets offensive about a censored material, they are going to report it and cause the rate to drop low	13
24342	4260	No library wants to hold books, music, movies, or magazines that have been reported by their community and nobody wants it	14
24343	4260	How would the author feel about their material getting reported because of somebody getting offensive by it	15
24344	4260	If the author wants to offend anybody, then they shouldn't even bother to publish it	16
24345	4260	The last reason is to get rid of the materials	17
24346	4260	Nobody wants to look at something that offends them	18
24347	4260	How would you feel that you took a movie home to watch the family and it had bad stuff in it and you didnt like it	19
24348	4260	You get offended and complain	20
24349	4260	Complaining is bad for business especially if its a government building	21
24350	4260	If we just get rid of the things that offend people, then we wouldn't have any problems	22
24351	4260	I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf if sombody if offended by it	23
24352	4260	There are really three main reasons	24
24353	4260	One is the the person might never come back to that place	25
24354	4260	Next, is that it could cause rate success drop down low	26
24355	4260	The last is to just get rid of the materials so they are no complains	27
24356	4260	Now, what do you believe	28
24357	4261	I believe that censorship within libraries and any other public media source is wrong, immoral, and unfair	0
24358	4261	Authors, artists, phtographers, etc	1
24359	4261	have the right to freedom of speech	2
24360	4261	Why should the consumers not have the same right to choose what they expose themselves to	3
24361	4261	The censorship of any media should not be allowed in public consumer spots, not only because it goes against basic american rights, but it also takes the responsibility, originality, and expression out of @CAPS1' lives	4
24362	4261	If a parent or gaurdian did not wish for their child to be exposed to certain genres of certain media, isn't it their responsibility to intercept that from their childs environment	5
24363	4261	If a parent really abhors a certain genre, then it is up to that parent to create a surrounding in which they feel that their child is safe	6
24364	4261	It is understandable that some genres of music, magazines, books and movie contain material that @MONTH1 be too graphic or mature for reader of a certain age, but situations like this in today's world is unavoidable	7
24365	4261	In my experience, I know that when I was to young to understand the happenings of @NUM1, my parents intercepted the stories from me	8
24366	4261	My parents turned off graphic or violent television when I walked in the room	9
24367	4261	They felt that this sort of material was inappropriate for someone at age @NUM2, so they exerpted that material from my environment	10
24368	4261	When you become a parent, you take on responsibility for the life of another person	11
24369	4261	This responsibility includes the childs health, safety, and his/her surroundings	12
24370	4261	Why can't @LOCATION1 leave the parenting of children to the parents	13
24371	4261	When children turn into teenagers and teengers become adults, they earn many privelages	14
24372	4261	They earn the right to drive, then the right to vote, then the right to drink responsibly	15
24373	4261	There is a maturity level that goes into making descisions on your own	16
24374	4261	if you are mature anough to decide who you want to run your country, how could you not be mature enough to decide something as insignificant as music choice	17
24375	4261	Authors, artists, composers, and phtographers, all by living in @LOCATION1, all have the right to the freedom of speech and freedom of expression	18
24376	4261	By censoring what products are published and put in public takes away that right	19
24377	4261	Some @MONTH1 argue that the artists and authors still have the right to express themselves, but they are expressing material that is to risque or graphic to promote	20
24378	4261	This is an understandable point, but who is the government to promote only what they want to promote	21
24379	4261	Why should the government have total control over the @CAPS1 are exposed to	22
24380	4261	If this were to happen, could it easily be taken too far by power hungry poloticians	23
24381	4261	Wouldn't @LOCATION1 no longer be a democracy, but rather a communist country, like @LOCATION2	24
24382	4261	American prides itself in being a 'mixing pot', and being accepting	25
24383	4261	If @LOCATION1 were to be like @LOCATION2, that would mean the restriction of expression and originailty throughout the country	26
24384	4261	Would you really want to live in a country where originality isn't really original, and acceptance was only what the goernment decided was acceptable	27
24385	4261	Would you be proud to live in a place where people don't have the opportunity to express themselves to others freely	28
24386	4261	I wouldn't	29
24387	4261	Although the censorship of media through a library is only on a small scale, but censorship is censorship	30
24388	4261	It is discrimination agaisnt composers of a certain genre of works	31
24389	4261	It is the removal of choice from @CAPS1' lives	32
24390	4261	It is denying the composers their right to freedom of speech	33
24391	4261	Whichever way you look at it, censorship is censorship, and censorship is wrong	34
24392	4262	Lots of people come to the library to check out books, music , movies , and other things for entertainment	0
24393	4262	Mainly children use the library more than any other age	1
24394	4262	The library is a place where you can be humble and relaxed	2
24395	4262	No one wants to check out thinks that are offensive in any type of way	3
24396	4262	Not even books that will influence bad things	4
24397	4262	Therefore certain things shouldn't be allowed to be checked out in libraries	5
24398	4262	Certain movies shouldn't be in the library	6
24399	4262	For example if a  child go to library they @MONTH1 see a movie that contains sexual activity and decided to check the movie out	7
24400	4262	The kid @MONTH1 be  underage and the movie would be considered inappropriate	8
24401	4262	The child @MONTH1 get in trouble by there guardian	9
24402	4262	In reality it would be the librarian's fault for letting the child check the movie out	10
24403	4262	That is why the movies should be censored	11
24404	4262	On the cover of many magazines women as well as men bodies are exposed.That @MONTH1 cause children to be attracted to the magazine	12
24405	4262	They @MONTH1 even decided to check the magazine out	13
24406	4262	Children are influenced by the things they see	14
24407	4262	Seeing naked bodies would be considered setting a bad example	15
24408	4262	In today's world all children listen to music	16
24409	4262	The music you listen to has a huge impact on your life	17
24410	4262	The music in libraries should be censored	18
24411	4262	Libraries should have music that encourage you to go out and be something in life	19
24412	4262	In my opinion only influential music should be able to be rented out	20
24413	4262	Reading is the key to success	21
24414	4262	Libraries should have books that will help you increase your vocabulary as well as educate you	22
24415	4262	Not the books that will talk about sexual things or even make you wonder about sex	23
24416	4262	Libraries should only have history, math , and educational books	24
24417	4262	In conclusion everything in the library should be censored	25
24418	4262	A lot of children use the library	26
24419	4262	Therefore it should be age appropriate	27
24420	4262	No child needs to be put under a bad influence	28
24421	4262	Certain thinks should be removed from the shelves to keep down less confusion.	29
24422	4263	I think that movies and magazines should be removed from the shelf because they might have some stuff in it that little kids could look at or watch	0
24423	4263	The movies and magazines will sometimes give some kids some ideas and the books should be removed because it had some words that people will be saying and the music should be removed because they have rap music	1
24424	4263	People shouldn't be listening to it	2
24425	4263	The music is sometimes not appropiate for all age and it can give people some ideas of what they say or do	3
24426	4263	The books and magazines can give people some ideas of what they say or do and they can believe anything of what they say	4
24427	4263	People should be reading good books and reading good magazines and listen to some good music	5
24428	4263	They are all offensive because they talk about bad stuff and doing bad stuff or talk about how they live their lives	6
24429	4263	Peolpe shouldn't be listening to some rap music or read the magazines or read some books that will give other people some ideas	7
24430	4263	The books sometimes talking about what happened a long time ago and stuff like that and it sometimes offense people like that	8
24431	4263	The magazines sometimes tell people what happened in the past and thenpeople don't want to read any magzines anymore	9
24432	4263	The people don't want to listen to any music anymore or read any books anymore	10
24433	4263	Most people will think that most books, magazines, and music are bad for the kids and for the adults	11
24434	4263	I think that it is offensive because music is not a good thing to listen to like rap or hip-hop	12
24435	4263	The people shouldn't be listening to rock music and they should just listen to some music that are appropiate	13
24436	4263	The books should be appropiate for all age and they should read something that they like	14
24437	4263	They should read some magazines that they like and that are good and appropiate	15
24438	4263	The music is offensive because they talk about inapproiate  stuff and they shouldn't be listening to it and the magazines have some inappropiate stuff and the books have some inappropiate stuff	16
24439	4263	The people won't like it and they might not want to check it out again or they won't check nothing out	17
24440	4263	I think that they should put some books on the shelves that people will like and the music that people will like	18
24441	4263	They should put some magazines on the shelves that people will want to look at or read	19
24442	4265	In libraries, there are of course books	0
24443	4265	There are mysteries, romances, comics, biographies and anything else that you @MONTH1 be able to think of	1
24444	4265	There are also magazines, movies, and even cd's that are at the libraries now	2
24445	4265	Then at libraries there are also those books and magazines	3
24446	4265	Those books being the ones I would never pick up off of the shelf myself let alone allow my future children to pick up	4
24447	4265	This is because those books contain material that is not at all conducive to the young person's brain	5
24448	4265	That is why I would like those books to be cencored so my child would never even know that the books are there	6
24449	4265	These books have in them people having sex and smoking drugs and their language in theses books are horrifying	7
24450	4265	These seem to be the kinds of books that young children have become interested in	8
24451	4265	They read them at school and get them somehow from their friends	9
24452	4265	They also find them in libraries and the more they read the more they want to do because they are influenced very easily	10
24453	4265	They are influenced by books characters that dont even exist some of the time	11
24454	4265	There are many reasons of why I feel that the books should be cencored but one of the biggest reasons are that because young people read these kind of books they go out and do what they read in the books	12
24455	4265	Thinking its okay because somebody that is not even real, most of the time, is doing it	13
24456	4265	I feel that these books are the reason that babies are raising babies children that are ten are going out having sex and getting pregnant and becoming eleven year old mothers	14
24457	4265	Where is that even heard of, but it happens and by the time those same children become freshmen in high school, if they even get there, they are carrying the responsibility of the baby they had when they were eleven	15
24458	4265	Those same children go through life wondering how different their stiuations could have been	16
24459	4265	So I feel like before these books go and mess up a whole other generation of children why don't we stop it here	17
24460	4265	Why does another child have to get pregnant at the age of ten for someone else to realize it's time to change things	18
24461	4265	Ten year old children are still just babies	19
24462	4265	The human brain isnt even fully developed until you are in around the age of twenty-five	20
24463	4265	So these children dont know if what they are reading is wrong beucase they haven't been taught that it is very wrong this is because at that age no parent expects that they will have to teach their not to have sex	21
24464	4265	Why you @MONTH1 ask, because at the age of ten what child should know about sex	22
24465	4265	At that age they still like to color and play with baby dolls or they like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 they should even be thinking about sex let alone know what it is	23
24466	4265	These materials should be taken off the shelves because children reading or looking at these kinds of books and magazines in libraries should not be happening	24
24467	4265	To stop yet another generation from messing up their lives taking the materials off is the best solution	25
24468	4265	After all shouldn't a parent get the chance to make sure their child isn't killing their chances to live a happy life in the future?	26
24469	4266	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,           I have been through some different libraries lately to see what other kind of information they had	0
24470	4266	I am also afraid to tell you that i have seen a censorship problem with our public libraries	1
24471	4266	I can understand why they might censor some of the more mature/graphic novels because of the children going in and out of the library all day, but, i do not believe that everyone else shouldnt be able to get the books they want because of content issues.One reason why i think there shouldnt be censorship in libraries is because some people need to find information on certain topics and there might not be any reliable information on it on the internet.if students in highschool or college dont have the information they need to write a paper or do a project for their classes then their grade could drop and also they could fall behind in work becauase theyre trying to catch up to where everybody else in their class are working.Another reason I think censorship in our libraries is because some of the things they censor could be the only copy of the book or the only one thats close to where you live	2
24472	4266	If they censor the one book that you need then that could possibly ruin the whole book for them	3
24473	4266	I believe that if a person is over the age of @NUM1, they should be able to take out any book they want and have it be uncensored	4
24474	4266	some people @MONTH1 take offense to some things written in these books, but if they dont like something, they shouldnt check it out in the first place.There are plenty of people around this world that have interest in millions apon millions of different topics	5
24475	4266	Also, some people @MONTH1 not be able to reasearch or explore their topics as much as they would like to because of the censorship problem in public libraries.if people could learn more about their interests they could go on to bigger and better things or maybe even just get a little bit smarter.In conclusion, I believe that censorship in libraries should be banned because of the problems it can cause and the effect it has on people	6
24476	4266	Censorship is a problem that needs to be dealt with as quickly and effecintly as possible.	7
24477	4267	Imagine a library without any materials that are considered offensive	0
24478	4267	In this library you wouldn't find many of the great pieces of literature that have impacted and influenced society @DATE1	1
24479	4267	You probably wouldn't find too many books, magazines, or movies that everyone in the @CAPS1 feels that are appropriate	2
24480	4267	Some of the great classic novels have contents that could be considered offensive to many people	3
24481	4267	Offensive materials should remain in libraries @DATE1 because something that is offensive to one person might not be to another person, who could be impacted by the piece of literature that is being banned	4
24482	4267	Music should also remain in libraries because the artist did not put the lyrics in the song to bring the listeners attention to the offensive material	5
24483	4267	Also offensive materials have made an impact in society for ages	6
24484	4267	First, materials that one individual finds offensive could be viewed another way by many others who enjoy the material	7
24485	4267	Some comedy and action movies are viewed as offensive or inappropriate to some people, but many others @MONTH1 enjoy the movie	8
24486	4267	If a movie, book, or magazine has the topic of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, it could be considered offensive to people who were a part of it, but it could also inform the reader or the person who is watching about the events that happened	9
24487	4267	If children want to see or read this material they should get permission from their parents first	10
24488	4267	Next, all music should remain in libraries	11
24489	4267	The music was created by an artist who made it for enjoyment and entertainment	12
24490	4267	The purpose of the music is not to bring the attention of offensive material to the listeners	13
24491	4267	The lyrics in some songs are innapropriate for children, but parents should not let their child listen to them	14
24492	4267	Lyrics can deal with really mature things that should only be heard and understood by adults	15
24493	4267	Last, offensive materials have impacted society for ages	16
24494	4267	Many things the founding fathers of the @LOCATION1 did were considered offensive, but that did not make them wrong, and it made the @CAPS1 a better place @DATE1	17
24495	4267	Offensive materials impact everyday life for better and worse	18
24496	4267	If all offensive materials were banned, they wouldn't be able to have an impact on @CAPS1 for better	19
24497	4267	In conclusion, offensive materials should remain in libraries @DATE1	20
24498	4267	The materials @MONTH1 be controversial, but they still are pieces of literature that deserve to be read and studied by the people of the @CAPS1	21
24499	4267	Offensive materials contain many teaching tools in life that could help out the lives of many people	22
24500	4267	The @CAPS1 would turn into that of the @CAPS1 in @PERSON1's novel @CAPS4 @NUM1, where all books were burned and society was not intellegent at all, if offensive materials were taken out of libraries @DATE1.	23
24501	4268	I think that some books should be banned from libraries that are offensive or use certain words against people, I think that should apply to highschool libraries because it really would matter in elementeries because they wouldn't know what some things mean	0
24502	4268	If a class were to read an offensive book and someyone in the class from the opposite race that reads the book others could get affended and it could start a fight	1
24503	4268	Some high schoolers could get affended quicker than others and which could cause a lot of problems so by avoiding that there should be votes on books that should be banned or not be aloud to be read in class or in school period	2
24504	4268	Im pretty sure people would think its dumb to ban books but trust it me it would solve a lot of problems, but it all comes down to whats acceptable and whats not without hurting other peoples feeling and putting them down	3
24505	4268	I bet all the time in classes theres been a story that has been read that has talked about races which makes others not feel comfortable, and theres always that person that always trys to make fun of something, but if I were in this situation I would try my best to not let others get to me and interfer with my grades and performance	4
24506	4268	I would just ignore them as much as possible and if it did start getting annoying I would talk to my counselor about trying to talk to that person individually or just removing me from class	5
24507	4268	I'm pretty sure most schools wouldnt tolerate this type of behavior but you will always have those kind of kids you just have to ignore	6
24508	4268	You should never not go to school thinking you don't fit in just because someyone is making fun of your race or how you look	7
24509	4268	They just try to make the day harder on you and all you have to do is ignore them or report it and hopefully it is taken care of	8
24510	4269	Censorship in libraries differ in certain areas	0
24511	4269	I personally love reading, and like all kinds of books	1
24512	4269	And I know that there are some books that I have read that my parents would not aprove of	2
24513	4269	But has that ever stopped me	3
24514	4269	Not exactly	4
24515	4269	I think that after a certain age, people should be aloud to read whatever they want	5
24516	4269	I mean, if I ever thought I could not be mature enough to read a certain book	6
24517	4269	Then I will not get or read the book, it is that simple	7
24518	4269	As far as music, movies, and magazines go that could be a different story	8
24519	4269	Music is for the most part like a book, just using a different one of your senses	9
24520	4269	And it is listened to, not read	10
24521	4269	Movies should be judged a little more carefully in my eyes, because movies are like show and tell	11
24522	4269	That could easily go wrong if children, teens, etc take it more than just a movie	12
24523	4269	I think all things should not be judged by assumption	13
24524	4269	Everyone has different opinions and likes	14
24525	4269	So, therefore material should not be removed from shelves, if there are people that like/support what the book, movie, or music has to offer.	15
24526	4270	What's your first thought when you're thinking about a library	0
24527	4270	Is it quiet, peace, or calm	1
24528	4270	Many people would think that until they come opon a certain book, magazine, movie, etc	2
24529	4270	They would start reading, and soon read something that is completely offensive	3
24530	4270	Books, magazines, movies, etc	4
24531	4270	should be censored and removed from a library if found offensive	5
24532	4270	Although everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I believe that a library is a place of peace	6
24533	4270	Having offensive literature in a library makes it look as though it's a bit trashy	7
24534	4270	If people want to read a certain magazine or book that offends a large sum of people, then they should go somewhere besides a library to find it	8
24535	4270	When I was younger, I participated in events at our local library	9
24536	4270	such as seeing who could read the most books over a certain amount of time, or other events like that	10
24537	4270	I liked to explore the library and find new things	11
24538	4270	I remember back then, and still today, there were always a large amount of magazines sitting on selfs, categorized into their correct sections	12
24539	4270	Many of them showing half-dressed women and men	13
24540	4270	Now, I understand that people like to know what is going on in the real world and like to be up to date, but I believe that they can go elsewhere to find such magazines	14
24541	4270	Having these offensive magazines in libraries for children to see is not good, and could easliy upset the parents of the children	15
24542	4270	Another reason why books, magazines, and others should be censored is because they @MONTH1 influence teens to do wrong and/or bad things	16
24543	4270	For example, many books talk about drugs and smoking	17
24544	4270	If teens read this, they @MONTH1 start thinking that it isn't wrong to do these things	18
24545	4270	If these type of books were to be removed from libraries, then I believe that the number of bad things that teens are influenced by would be greatly decreased because they aren't going to read them	19
24546	4270	In my personal opinion, libraries would be better if books, magazines, movies, etc	20
24547	4270	would be censored	21
24548	4270	Not only would it make people happier, it would make the world better	22
24549	4270	Besides, if you are looking to read something bad, you shouldn't be looking in a library anyway!	23
24550	4271	My views on censorship are strong	0
24551	4271	I think that if a book, movie, ect	1
24552	4271	is descriminating towards one or more groups of people then I think that people should have the right to atleast have a say in wether it should be on the shelves of a library or not	2
24553	4271	Although books could be descriminating too, if the book it about something that has happened in the past and is the past of our country, then I think that people should also have a say in keeping it on the shelves	3
24554	4271	If these materials are using offensive language or actions to harm or discriminate against that race then they should be taken off of the shelves	4
24555	4271	If they are part of the history of the world or of our country, then I think that they should be left there for future generations to learn about it and to know that these things happened	5
24556	4271	Most materials dont try to discriminate any race, and if they did, then I don't think it would be in the library in the first place	6
24557	4271	For me, censorship could go both ways	7
24558	4271	It really just depends on the stuation and the material	8
24559	4271	Someone could have an opinion that it is offensive, but that doesnt mean that is a fact	9
24560	4271	If the book is popular in the library and a lot of people like to come in and read it, then I don't think I would remove the book	10
24561	4271	People view offensive writing and actions differently from one another	11
24562	4271	So, I think it depends on the situation	12
24563	4271	If I was a parent these days, I would let my child read one of these so called offensive books if it was part of the past for our country	13
24564	4271	My attentions for letting him read it are for all the right reasons	14
24565	4271	I dont attend to let him read it so that he can act upon the things told about in the book	15
24566	4271	I would let him read it to learn about the past	16
24567	4271	I think it is a positive thing for children to know about the past	17
24568	4271	So, in my perspective, censorship depends on the situation and the material	18
24569	4271	These are only my views on the topic, and also these statements are my opinion	19
24570	4271	So I can't really say if I am for censorship or not.	20
24571	4272	Do I believe that certain materials, suck as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
24572	4272	No I do not believe this statement for many reasons	1
24573	4272	If anybody cold take books off the shelves in the libraries, there would no longer be any use for libraries, students in school will have a harder time learning about certian topics in the world, it would defeat the purpus of having the ability of freedom of speech, we could easily avoid this problem if needed	2
24574	4272	One reason I believe that taking books off the shelves is because, if we all have the right to take books we find offensive there would no longer be any books no the shelves	3
24575	4272	This would limit us the ability for students to learn about many important topics in the world	4
24576	4272	Just the other day I heard a lady telling her daughter that she was not going to allow her to go to school the day they have 'the talk', (sex education for students in grade six), because she thought she was too young to learn about that area of education	5
24577	4272	Yes, that @MONTH1 be true, but it also means that her daughter is not going to know about the many diseases you can get from underage, and or unpretected sex	6
24578	4272	This @MONTH1 lead her daughter to having sex at a young age and getting pregnate, or some kind of disease, that could have easily been prevented with a little education from library books, or a class at school	7
24579	4272	Another reason I do not believe in the right of taking books from the shelves is because, when we are taking these books off the shelves, we are taking someones very hard work and just throwing it into the trash	8
24580	4272	In my opinion it is very disrespectful to the authors, and anybody else who was involved in writing those books	9
24581	4272	Just because you do not agree with what they are writing does not mean you can just throw it away	10
24582	4272	This would being defeating the purpose of haveing freedom of speech	11
24583	4272	Taking those books off the shelves is basically telling the authors that they are not aloud to write about what they want and publish it	12
24584	4272	It is also telling them that they are not allow to state thier oppinion	13
24585	4272	This problem could easily be avoided if needed	14
24586	4272	For example, those books, music pieces, movies, magizines, etc., could be put in a seprate section of the library, and only make it availble to adults of a certain age	15
24587	4272	Have the books, and other writing pieces rated in the same way that movies are	16
24588	4272	This would be a very simple and effective way to solve this problem	17
24589	4272	Like I mentioned earlier I strongly disagree with giving citizens the right to take certain materials, suck as books, movies, music, magazines, ect., off the shelves if you or anyone else find them offensive	18
24590	4272	It could effect the community in many ways, it is very rude and disrespectful to the autor of that piece of writing, and there are simple solutions to this problem	19
24591	4273	Yes, I believe that books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed off the shelf if they are offensive and inappropriate	0
24592	4273	People should have the freedom of speech but not in an offensive manner	1
24593	4273	If people want to have heir things shown such, as movies or heard, such as music, it should be appropriate	2
24594	4273	Just because other people are doing it doesn't make it right	3
24595	4273	Some people have little sense of knowledge not to do the things that the movies, or songs say to do	4
24596	4273	Most people like the songs because it says to do bad things, they just want to be heard, or want attention	5
24597	4273	When I listened to music or watched movies, I got the same ideas as other kids my age and younger	6
24598	4273	I did stupid stuff because I thought that it was right	7
24599	4273	People just want to get their voice out there, and to be heard	8
24600	4273	I learned to get my voice heard, I needed to do it in an appropriate manner	9
24601	4273	Some artists or actors don't want to convey these kinds of things to kids, but the only way to get there stuff out to the public is to make it offensive	10
24602	4273	I stopped reading and watching this stuff because I learned the hard way, and the only way that I will be heard is to say and do the appropriate stuff	11
24603	4273	The way I look at things is @CAPS1 ( @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Do)	12
24604	4274	Censorship has been around for awhile and a lot of people agree that there should be censorship on a lot of things like telivision, books, magazines, almost about everything	0
24605	4274	Some people are going a little bit too far when it comes to older teens	1
24606	4274	There not little kids and they shouldn't have things censored	2
24607	4274	Like when you go to see a rated @CAPS1 movie and you have to be with an adult to watch that movie	3
24608	4274	For little kids I think that they should have things censored because there young	4
24609	4274	They just dont need to be hearing bad language and anything	5
24610	4274	Parents should also care about what there child hears or reads if there young	6
24611	4274	Some parents don't even care what they see or hear and they end up getting in trouble with there teachers if they say it	7
24612	4274	It seems like the younger kids are always learning bad language or bad habits and I think its sad because they shouldn't be around that	8
24613	4274	They pick up alot of stuff when there young so your like a role model for them	9
24614	4274	I believe that older teens like @NUM1 and @NUM2 are more mature about this, if they read a book in the library that might have a bad word	10
24615	4274	Im sure they hear it all the time on the bus or when your in town	11
24616	4274	They going to hear it anyways so why try to stop it when there going to end up hearing it	12
24617	4274	Books are suppose to help you and give you the real thing	13
24618	4274	You can't just throw out books or censor them	14
24619	4274	Everybody has there different opinion and this is my opinion	15
24620	4274	When you get at a certain age you start to mature and realize those are bad things to say or do so I believe high school books or magazines or anything else shouldn't be censored	16
24621	4275	Imagine, you go into your favorite library and you go to grab your favorite book or movie and its not there	0
24622	4275	The librarian says the book was removed from all public libraries because it was found offensive	1
24623	4275	Would this not get on your nerves	2
24624	4275	Especially if you had read the book yourself and found nothing wrong with it	3
24625	4275	Sure, there are some books that children should not be allowed to see due to offensive material	4
24626	4275	but why remove them completely	5
24627	4275	There are plenty of alternet solutions that could please everyone	6
24628	4275	Such as having a section only adults are allowed into, having a seperate public place for adults to get the books, movies, ect	7
24629	4275	and having signed permission from a parent or guardian saying their child could check out certain items	8
24630	4275	The first solution is to have certain offensive material under lock and key from the public	9
24631	4275	If only the librarian had access to this material a child could not simply walk in and borrow what he, or she deems fit	10
24632	4275	The librarian would be the only one allowed to judge if the person, child or adult, could see this section of the librairy	11
24633	4275	Next, there could be a totally separate building for the offensive material	12
24634	4275	Only people over @NUM1 would be let in and you would have to an i.d and a librairy card to get in	13
24635	4275	This would assure that no one uinderage could recieve or take anything that was deemed unfit	14
24636	4275	My last solution is to have signed permission for anyone underage	15
24637	4275	When the child comes to get a librairy card the parent must be present and fill out an application saying what the child can and cannot check out	16
24638	4275	I do not believe that books, movies, music, ect	17
24639	4275	should be removed from shelves	18
24640	4275	This directly goes against the first ammendment, free speech	19
24641	4275	If a person can say what someone else can or cannot read, see, or listen to whats to stop them from taking every @CAPS1 given right we have	20
24642	4275	Whats to stop them from censoring everything we write and say	21
24643	4275	Would you want to live in a world like that	22
24644	4275	I would most certainly not	23
24645	4275	However, I also believe that certain age groups should not be allowed to have access to certain material	24
24646	4275	I believe these are good altercations to prevent this from happening if only we take the steps to accomplish them	25
24647	4276	What other people take as offensive might be taken to others as something they value	0
24648	4276	I believe that all sorts of books, music, and magazines should stay on the shelves at the library	1
24649	4276	People value many different things and we need to give others an opportunity to explore what else there is	2
24650	4276	Different types of books explain different types of things	3
24651	4276	Some people connect with books in a way that others @MONTH1 not understand	4
24652	4276	Taking certain types of books away can risk other peoples feelings	5
24653	4276	Taking music, in my opinion, would be the worst because people get lost in some types of music	6
24654	4276	They use music to escape their probems and taking that away can leave them helpless	7
24655	4276	People love movies	8
24656	4276	It helps people understand what is going on in other peoples point of views	9
24657	4276	Taking away movies could leave people with no entertainment	10
24658	4276	People like different movies and some movies can be offensive	11
24659	4276	But, it's not up to anybody else	12
24660	4276	Magazines help people keep up with news	13
24661	4276	Most of the news can be very offensive	14
24662	4276	It is the people around you causing the offensive news	15
24663	4276	Taking away magazines can be keeping people from the latest gossip and news	16
24664	4276	Taking away things that people use to connect with, what they use to escape with, their entertainment, and the news would most likely cause peoepl to act out in a bad way	17
24665	4276	Everybody is defferent and everybody likes different things and taking away something that others think is offensive is unfair to the people that think it isn't	18
24666	4276	What if somebody thought what you liked was inappropriate	19
24667	4276	How would you feel?	20
24668	4277	'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2', 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4', 'The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2'	0
24669	4277	Do these titles sound familiar	1
24670	4277	They should, beause these are only a tiny fraction of the @CAPS3 literary masterpeices that people have enjoyed since their publications	2
24671	4277	These wonderful books also share another characteristic, they have all been banned from certain libraries across the country and around the world	3
24672	4277	When a child goes off to school ecah day, his or her parents are left to think that he or she will be getting a quality education that meets the stadards of their own core values and morals	4
24673	4277	But certain parents @MONTH1 become outraged when they see the books shelved on schools library shelves that they see as wrong, and don't want their precious children exposed to such immoral concepts that go against their idea of what is right	5
24674	4277	In all reality though, how is this helping anyone	6
24675	4277	By keeping a student away from a book or subject, the person causing the censorship is limiting what that student can learn	7
24676	4277	By censoring things people are not only kept from ideas that might shock them, but also from ideas that might make them think	8
24677	4277	If a person cannot think for themselves, they cannot draw their own conclusions on things	9
24678	4277	When one cannot think for oneself or make decisios for oneself, how can this person be considered a free individual	10
24679	4277	Infamous dictators, such as @PERSON1, burned books to keep his citizens from thinking what he did not want them to think	11
24680	4277	By banning a book in a school library, a parent is also keeping their child from thinking what they do not want them to think	12
24681	4277	And when you want a book out of a shool library you are ot only keepig your child from reading this book, but everyone who goes to the school from reading the book	13
24682	4277	How is that fair	14
24683	4277	So instead of wanting certain books to be off the shelves of your childs school, I say this	15
24684	4277	Teach your children to be careful in what they read	16
24685	4277	If you don't wan them to read 'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2' tell them not to read that book	17
24686	4277	Tell your children to follow the moral guidelines you want them to follow, and if certain books keep them from having their own thoughs instead of yours, just tell them not to look, and don't bother everyoe else about it	18
24687	4278	Certain books should be removed from, the library because of the materials an  the stuff they show to younger children	0
24688	4278	One reason they should thake those books of is because some of the are racist against some cultures	1
24689	4278	Another reason is that some of the books or movies etc., would have things in them that young children shouldnt be looking at or reading	2
24690	4278	A final reason is that some books just shouldnt be in the librayies at all	3
24691	4278	The first reason was that the books should be taken out of the library is because their racist	4
24692	4278	They should take them off because they can teach young children the wrong things	5
24693	4278	Also they can teach the children how to treat people different because their reading those books from hte library	6
24694	4278	They would also get  he wrong idea about peopple  and different cultures	7
24695	4278	Second reason why they should get rid of that bad stuff in the libraries is because they would have things in their that young children should not be wacthing or reading	8
24696	4278	Like they shouldnt have movies with killing and drug dealing or about drinking or anything a child shouldnt be looking at	9
24697	4278	It gives the children the wrong idea and they will think its okay becasue they seen it in the movies or read it in a book	10
24698	4278	Final reason is that they shouldnt just have those things in a library at all or should just have place for where the young kids cant use them	11
24699	4278	Or they would need a parent or sombody thats eightteen so they wouldnt be able to just get these bad books or movies	12
24700	4278	In conclusion libraries shouldnt have books or music or magazines or movies in them at all	13
24701	4278	They give kids wrong ideas an make them think that its cool or the right thing to do cause they saw it in a movie or read it in a book	14
24702	4278	That doesnt make it the right thing to do thats why they should get rid of that stuff.	15
24703	4279	Keep it on the shelvesThe reason for libraries is so that people can read what they want to read	0
24704	4279	If I owned a library I would have everything on the shelves because there are alot of people and not everyone likes the same thing	1
24705	4279	Truthfully I wouldn't care because it isnt just about a handful of people it is about everyones feelings	2
24706	4279	If people started taking certain things out of there book stores libraries it would eventually get out of hand	3
24707	4279	The reason it would get out of hand is because a certain topic like slavery if someone wanted to learn about it or enjoyed reading topics like that it wouldnt be fair because @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people might find it offensive to put stuff out there for the public like that	4
24708	4279	Everyone has their own opinion but why express your own opinion if the subject you want to express it under isn't harming anyone physically or emotionally	5
24709	4279	If everyones opinion was heard and taken into consideration tghe world as we know it would be boring and outragous	6
24710	4279	People like action and adventures, others like laid back kind of stuff	7
24711	4279	Why take things from people that they have had for a very long time if its just going to start a conflict and change the way people live everyday life	8
24712	4279	Maybe it could turn out in a good way but really what are the chances of that @NUM1 billion to a thousand	9
24713	4279	Things that are offensive to some people are very interesting to others so keep everything on the shelves	10
24714	4279	If only certain people are going to complain about it its not really a big deal	11
24715	4279	Maybe someday when everyone in the world agrees on @NUM2 reasoning then we could change it but i really dont see that happening anytime soon	12
24716	4279	The main reason is there is always going to be conflict between @NUM3 or more groups of people	13
24717	4279	Everyone cant be happy at the same time i say who cares weather something offends someone or not thats their opionion and until alot more people are seeing it and can stay on the shelf for the people that actually enjoy that kind of stuff.	14
24718	4280	Books	0
24719	4280	Movies	1
24720	4280	Music	2
24721	4280	Magazines	3
24722	4280	We all like to read them, watch them, and listen to them	4
24723	4280	@CAPS2's hard to stop all that	5
24724	4280	Plus, @CAPS2's impossible to stop	6
24725	4280	Everywhere you go you can find these items	7
24726	4280	Such as the movie store, the mall, a gas station, a yard sale, and even your public library	8
24727	4280	People of all ages can go anywhere and get a book, movie, a @CAPS1, or a magazine and @CAPS2's perfectly fine	9
24728	4280	But, there is one problem	10
24729	4280	Censorship	11
24730	4280	Yes that's what i said, 'censorship.' @CAPS2 means alot to some parents when @CAPS2 comes to their children	12
24731	4280	Espescially when @CAPS2 comes to the public library where they live	13
24732	4280	If a parent wants to take their kids to the library and get some books or movies or ect	14
24733	4280	that's okay but if a parent has to worry about a movie or magazine has 'bad things' in @CAPS2 that children shouldn't see is a problem	15
24734	4280	They want to be able to enjoy the movie or @CAPS1 or magazine with their children but bad things like nudity, violence, racial pictures, or profanity can be really offensive to parents AND people alone, just not parents	16
24735	4280	A lot of these examples can be offensive to anyone or everyone and censorship is a pretty good idea	17
24736	4280	There is no way if I was a parent that I would want my kids to look at or watch or read any 'bad things' because we all know that is not right	18
24737	4280	Kids are young and don't need to be learning about that stuff at a young age	19
24738	4280	I think censoring is a really great idea and I think Libraries and other places that have books, movies, music, magazines, ect	20
24739	4280	should censorize there things	21
24740	4280	But if they wont censorize anything they should at least put them in catagories such as 'adults' or 'young adults' or 'kids'	22
24741	4280	If they catagorize the ratings then the parents and you know where to look for and don't have to worry about censorship	23
24742	4280	Censorship should be practiced everywhere.	24
24743	4281	Corrupt Censorship     @CAPS1 @MONTH1 occur when censorship decides to remove or block	0
24744	4281	showing certain media or readable content all pertains to the creator	1
24745	4281	In some cases, the distributor and less the author, director, or publisher, has no opinion on whether to display the product they have made, but from their own habit of making what they enjoy	2
24746	4281	it is the will from the store, person or etc	3
24747	4281	to display these materials	4
24748	4281	Libraries have an exponential option to publicly put up on their shelves or stock, but restricting too graphic material is all depended on the eduacational rules the library is equipted with	5
24749	4281	Any type of content is art, art that should never be even considered to be changed or enhanced because it pertains to one artist	6
24750	4281	You can never remake, rewrite or recreate that visual material provided from the creator	7
24751	4281	And you are not aloud to, unless given permission to from the creator	8
24752	4281	Censoring or removing on the other hand, is permitted to the distributor	9
24753	4281	Their choice to publicly demonstrate something made by someone is all their choice	10
24754	4281	Libraries for example, show that any given media or readable content is publicly displayed for anyone to see, so long as the audience fits their rules or criterias	11
24755	4281	In some instances, partial side of the audience will run across unexpected media and will have the inexecptional pursuasion to accept what is demonstrated	12
24756	4281	Though it is not the creators fault to ensure where their content is diplayed, but the audience's fault in whether to see that material	13
24757	4281	It is choice to read or see whatever you'd like, you aren't forced upon to follow through to what the distributor-let alone the creator- is offering	14
24758	4281	Enjoying the topic or material is optional	15
24759	4281	When you have options in front of you, any given topics or subject to read or follow, it it your will to chose to read or see them	16
24760	4281	Enjoying is even more harder, but when a library's limit is basically the sky, you should not force it on them to throw out the book just because the censorship isnt up to your level	17
24761	4281	It is not the library to blame, but your own	18
24762	4281	Everyone has different views on certain content and it isnt your obligation to view it	19
24763	4281	When you take down materials @CAPS2 intended for those who chose to view and enjoy, you destroy not @CAPS2 art a creator has made, but the joy that filled a viewers taste	20
24764	4281	Libraries shouldnt exceptionalize for certain people's expectations because not everyone finds censorship a solution	21
24765	4281	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	22
24766	4281	But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so deos everyone else	23
24767	4281	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'	24
24768	4282	Now days people can get offended over anything	0
24769	4282	In todays trying time readers, listeners, even wirters, are trying to get what they want not what the consumer wants	1
24770	4282	Even though some stories, books, or articles, are completly bogus it shouldn't matter	2
24771	4282	Dont let others opinions ruin it for everyone else	3
24772	4282	Many people get offended now days over absolutly nothing	4
24773	4282	and they feel the need to do somthing about it	5
24774	4282	whitch nesessarly isn't a bad thing but isn't a good thing either.It is freedom of speach, or so thats what the constitution says, meaning folks have the right to read, write, or say, anything they please	6
24775	4282	Fake and bogus writings is a small problem to readers, and writers	7
24776	4282	People are reading articles, and book and believing every bit of what they read or write or even hear on their radio in recent times	8
24777	4282	It is hard to believe anything now days, because you never really know the facts unless you experence them your self	9
24778	4282	Opinions are the big thing folks have to look out for, but still that goes back to the freedom of speach	10
24779	4282	Reading, and writing is a wonderful thing to do and has been around longer than any human will ever know	11
24780	4282	Just don't let other readers opinions get in the way of a great thing	12
24781	4283	Controversey and @CAPS1     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
24782	4283	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
24783	4283	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (Katherine Paterson, Author.) Paterson makes a very valid point here	2
24784	4283	Right off the bat, I can think of many offensive or inappropriate books, movies, songs, and magazines	3
24785	4283	There are equal amounts of good and bad publications, and the decision of what is good or bad is very controvesial	4
24786	4283	The creator of each song, movie, song, magazine, or any other publication has made their product for a specific customer	5
24787	4283	Playboy magazine was not created for five year olds, but for desparate sex-crazed men, and @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 wasn't made for adults, but for young kids	6
24788	4283	Usually, the intended purpose of the product is not meant to be negative	7
24789	4283	It breaks my heart to hear of the rising amount of people of varrying ages getting into pornography	8
24790	4283	I think the whole idea of it is wrong, degrading, and uttterly disgusting, but others firmly disagree	9
24791	4283	Some religions think the @CAPS4 series is blasphemous evil, as others don't agree at all	10
24792	4283	Controversey fills everything in our culture	11
24793	4283	We all have our opinions and choices	12
24794	4283	Should I have the right to take away books from my child	13
24795	4283	My mother would not let me read the @ORGANIZATION1 books when I was younger	14
24796	4283	She felt that it was from the devil and pure evil	15
24797	4283	That make me desire to read it even more than before	16
24798	4283	When I entered middle school, I read the books anyway: I had the ability to make my own choices	17
24799	4283	I didn't see the devil in the books	18
24800	4283	I actually felt the opposite feelings toward the book	19
24801	4283	The books reflected upon good vs	20
24802	4283	evil, which I saw as @CAPS5 vs	21
24803	4283	Satan	22
24804	4283	My opinions and views were very different than my mother's	23
24805	4283	If I would have read the books when I was younger, I might've thought differently	24
24806	4283	I think that my mom protected me from what could have been bad	25
24807	4283	I think it is perfectly fine to protect your kids by setting up rules and boundaries	26
24808	4283	Parents just need to be aware that once the kids are older, they will make the choices on their own	27
24809	4283	All in all, certain books will be in the kids section for a reason, and others will be in the adult section for other reasons	28
24810	4283	We must use our judgement and trust our kids to make good choices on what they allow to enter their brain and consume their thoughts.	29
24811	4285	Do people take offensive books serious	0
24812	4285	There are lots of stuff in book that people @MONTH1 think is offensive	1
24813	4285	Some other people @MONTH1 think differently	2
24814	4285	I pretty sure libraries have censored shelves, but if not people shouldn't get so worried about it and here are ways	3
24815	4285	I feel that certain materials that young people see in books, music, and movies are at the library	4
24816	4285	They see stuff that's around them	5
24817	4285	they also see what there mentor and parents are doing/watching too	6
24818	4285	The author of the quote (Katherine Paterson) can't just blame it all on the library	7
24819	4285	In the paragraph I wrote before this I said that children see things that there metor and parents are doing	8
24820	4285	Now today in the @NUM1 century parents really don't keep a good eye things and what they leave out for what they child can get	9
24821	4285	Kids like to play with stuff they first see	10
24822	4285	If parents don't want there child seeing offensive material and other stuff on the shelves in a library then they should watch what they kids are doing more carefully and watch over their backs	11
24823	4285	I really don't care that the shelves in libraries are offensive	12
24824	4285	I just don't pay any attention to it anyway	13
24825	4285	We are living in a better world that it was years ago	14
24826	4285	If people still are getting mad over petty stuff like that, then what are they still here for	15
24827	4285	When young children get older they are going to end up seeing things that they coudn't see that's still going to be on the shelves in a library	16
24828	4285	We shoudn't take books offensive	17
24829	4285	After all they are just words on a piece of paper	18
24830	4285	I believe that offensive materials and other stuff should stay on the shelves of library	19
24831	4285	Besides some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly.	20
24832	4286	I think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelvs	0
24833	4286	If a book, magazine, movie, etc, is found offensive then you should just walk away and ignore it	1
24834	4286	Dont go back and keep looking at it because what you find offensive someone else might like	2
24835	4286	The world won't change around you so you shoud do the smart thing and ignore it	3
24836	4286	If somthing is found offensive on censorship in libraries then mabey its not a good idea for you to be where you are in that library	4
24837	4286	And if somthing does offend you, you should still act appropreatley and deal with the situation the right way	5
24838	4286	When i was younger i used to see book's with a cover titled @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc., and would think it was funny, but the adults didnt think so	6
24839	4286	The books are put there for people to read not just to look at	7
24840	4286	The books, music, movies, magazines are not there to offend you in any type of way	8
24841	4286	If you find somthing offensive then you should just move away from that area, so that you wont worry about having to be offended	9
24842	4286	Diffrerent people like different things, so they will have many different verieties to choose from in a library	10
24843	4286	They might have some things that really offend you or they might have some things that you really like	11
24844	4286	You have to make a wise choice and know that if somthing is goin to offend you stay away from it	12
24845	4286	Censorship in libraries have every right to put up any and every peice of book, music, movie, magazine, etc., because it in their phacility	13
24846	4286	They should'nt have to worry about people being offended by anything they put up	14
24847	4286	They should'nt have to worry about people being offended because @PERCENT1 of the time the things they put up are not bad at all, 'it @MONTH1 even be helpful,' but to one person it @MONTH1 be harmful or offend them	15
24848	4286	In @CAPS5, censorship in libraries should be able to post or shelve anything they want	16
24849	4286	If your offended/not offended they have every right to shelve whatever it is	17
24850	4286	because in the real world you dont always get what you want, and you wont always like what you see	18
24851	4287	A library is safe haven	0
24852	4287	A place people can go to escape the world and stick their head into a book	1
24853	4287	It is a place filled with knowledge and information	2
24854	4287	You can find information on anything in a library, from any point of view	3
24855	4287	Information in libraries should not be censored, even if the information is considered offensive	4
24856	4287	A library should not be biased	5
24857	4287	Removing certain information from a library would be biased to whatever group believes in that knowledge	6
24858	4287	Whether or not something is offensive, the information should be out there for one to learn about if he chooses	7
24859	4287	Having information in a library that @MONTH1 be offensive does not mean a person is oblidged to read it	8
24860	4287	Katherine Paterson brings up a good point when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...and you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	9
24861	4287	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'	10
24862	4287	If everyone could remove a book that offended them, there would be no books left	11
24863	4287	There are many different views on many different subjects and everyone should have the opportunity to be educated on others' points of views	12
24864	4287	For example, there are many different religions in the world	13
24865	4287	Many of the religions have very conflicting points of views and some of their view points @MONTH1 offend each other	14
24866	4287	That does not mean that we should not provide information on different world religions simply because a person from another religion @MONTH1 be offended	15
24867	4287	Every person that goes to a library should have the right to educate themselves on others' religions	16
24868	4287	If we censored all the books that offended people, we would live in a very uneducated world	17
24869	4287	A library is a place of education and learning	18
24870	4287	It is a place one can go and learn about any subject he chooses	19
24871	4287	If libraries censored information, then it would no longer be a place that is unbiased	20
24872	4287	It would hold a sway to a certain group of people and therefore, no longer be a safe haven for all to go and escape the world	21
24873	4287	One could not go to a library and get different points of views on every subject	22
24874	4287	Censorship on books and other materials in libraries would be a very negative thing.	23
24875	4288	Hi, my name is @CAPS1 and I am writing this article today to talk about things that shouldn't be in the library	0
24876	4288	There are many, many things that shouldn't be exposed to children such as, sexcism,racism,rarted @CAPS3, pornography	1
24877	4288	So i am here today to tell you all about them things	2
24878	4288	First off books that have racist comments in them should not be exposed to our young children.Why	3
24879	4288	Because that is setting a bad example for them so they might think they can say and do the things thats the book does	4
24880	4288	Another thing is sex in books	5
24881	4288	I know you have read stories that talks about sex and how to do it and all sorts of things	6
24882	4288	So to sum this up they shouldn't be allowed in public libraries	7
24883	4288	The second thing that shouldn't be allowed in public libraries is @CAPS2-@CAPS3 movies	8
24884	4288	Things such as horror movies, porn, and many more	9
24885	4288	So young children should not be exposed to these such things because it damages there mind at a young age	10
24886	4288	It teaches them things that they shouldn't know about until they get a little bit older	11
24887	4288	The last reason why I feel that many things shouldn't be in the libraries are for the @CAPS4 magazines	12
24888	4288	Those magazines just show everything they have all type of naked photos in them	13
24889	4288	These really do not need to be exposed to our young children because	14
24890	4288	Our little girls will think it is ok for them to take naked photos of themselves and post it in books and on the internet	15
24891	4288	So all in all, all of these things should be banded from the libraries for many different reasons	16
24892	4288	So the @LOCATION1 should think about what I am saying	17
24893	4288	Just think if it were your children being exposed to innappropiate things	18
24894	4289	As a small child I remember my mom reading me stories to put my to sleep	0
24895	4289	There was always one book that I remember the most named, 'A light in the @CAPS1' by @PERSON1	1
24896	4289	As i was walking into my public library the other day i was looking at the books that had been cenored because it encouraged, the following	2
24897	4289	mistreating parents, offensive language, bad habits, and other things	3
24898	4289	I was mad that this book had, essentally, been erased from all of children literature just because a few people @CAPS2 that it gives a bad message	4
24899	4289	Think about it though, when you are a child either having a book read to you, or reading one yourself do you honestly pay attention to such small details	5
24900	4289	I do not think that books and music should not be censored, because society does a good job of thinking and figuring out what is acceptable and what is not	6
24901	4289	I understand the idea of warning labels, but i feel that censorship is too far	7
24902	4289	In the example I used in the paragraph above, that actually happened to me	8
24903	4289	So, i do not think that things should be censored just because a small group of people think that it is inappropriate	9
24904	4289	Even when i read that book today i do not see any of the reasons that were listed in the book	10
24905	4289	Therefor beleive that it was unjustly censored, meaning that a really good book will never reach the eyes and ears of child that deserve to hear and read it	11
24906	4289	Over the years many things have been censored, some had an actual reason, others maybe were looked at and censored because somebody did not like how they read the book	12
24907	4289	the point is, is that people should have a choice of what they can get from their public or school library	13
24908	4289	Maybe, they should just give an idea saying that there is potentailly inapprapriate materail in that certain book and should not be read to or by a certain age group	14
24909	4289	when you look back to your childhood and think of all the books that were read to you that you enjoyed, how many of those books have been cesored for reasons that make no sense	15
24910	4289	That is the primary reason why I believe there should not be any censorship	16
24911	4290	Almost every city in the @LOCATION1 has a public library	0
24912	4290	A place where the citizens can check out books, music, movies, magazines and more	1
24913	4290	Inside a library, there are different sections	2
24914	4290	There are kids sections, adult, fiction, and many more	3
24915	4290	Just like any ordinary store, there are items in a library that are not subject for children	4
24916	4290	A common question has been coming up everday life, 'Should we remove these offensive items from our shelves?'                                               Libraries have been around for years and so have uncensored things that are being put in front of children	5
24917	4290	As a child, you want to explore and know everything	6
24918	4290	Bad things will always be put in front of you as an obstacle to make the right choice	7
24919	4290	Just like these degrading items found in everyday stores, libraries, or in general everywhere you go	8
24920	4290	A library, however, is not just intended for adults, teenagers, or young children	9
24921	4290	A library is made for everyone's access and not everyone is alike	10
24922	4290	Therefore there is plenty of variety in these libraries	11
24923	4290	It should never be a libraries fault for containing things not appropriete for children in my belief	12
24924	4290	Almost every library is very organized into categories	13
24925	4290	If children are separated and exclusive to adult material, I see no problem in having these items on the shelves	14
24926	4290	When I visit a library, these items are very out of reach for children	15
24927	4290	Society knows what should and should not be brought upon a child, so they know not to put it in any reach of children	16
24928	4290	'All of us can think of a book that we hope non of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' said Author, Katherine Paterson	17
24929	4290	Katherine makes a very valid statement	18
24930	4290	If I have a child one day, I could think of plenty of materials I would hope my child never came acrossed	19
24931	4290	However, as a parent it is their job to protect their children from these things	20
24932	4290	Coming from a teenage perspective, at a young age, I was very clueless about all the terrible things sitting around me	21
24933	4290	A majority of children would not be able to get their hands on such uncensored items, nor would they understand them if they did	22
24934	4290	There are things in this world that are much worse for children to see then taking a quick glance at something not for their age at a library	23
24935	4290	If anything, concerned parents should be paying more attention to what their children come in contact with at stores, the people they are around, or what they are listening/watching	24
24936	4290	The internet is probably the most uncensored place a child can come acrossed	25
24937	4290	Reaching out to libraries about what they put on their shelves should be of their least concern compared to what is really out there in life	26
24938	4290	I do believe that no children should be handed or put in front of uncensored adult conduct because one-hundred percent unacceptable	27
24939	4290	If these items were placed in spots where only adults can get ahold of, then I see no problem in the situation	28
24940	4290	The children of our generation and more to come will always encounter something they should not be put in fron of	29
24941	4290	However, that is life and there will always be something come up in your life that you should not witness or be apart of	30
24942	4290	If libraries continue to keep these items out of reach of children, then there should be no censorship in libraries.	31
24943	4291	Censorship, @CAPS1 or @CAPS2	0
24944	4291	I can understand why libraries would decide to keep certain books off their shelves	1
24945	4291	Libraries are a place for learning and work	2
24946	4291	If you were sitting near someone at a public library who was reading smut you could feel awkward	3
24947	4291	Although some people @MONTH1 find certain items unoffensive, other @MONTH1 disagree	4
24948	4291	Imagine you are a mother with a young child who decided to wonder through the library	5
24949	4291	Your child finds a magazine	6
24950	4291	It's '@CAPS3'	7
24951	4291	Not something that you are going to want to explain to your child	8
24952	4291	If the library were to have not kept the magazine, it never would have happened	9
24953	4291	Libraries are a public place that should be taken seriously	10
24954	4291	If people really want to find something that is inappropriate they can find it somewhere else	11
24955	4291	The modern world today makes it easy for people to find just about anything without a large hassle	12
24956	4291	Therefore it should be fine to keep certain materials out of our libraries	13
24957	4291	How can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books, or books with rude language, and scandalous themes	14
24958	4291	If you are trying to get work done or learn and there are distracting items on the shelves then it @MONTH1 make things more difficult	15
24959	4291	Libraries are serious places and should be treated as such.	16
24960	4292	There should be a certain age bookshelf that only certain aged people are aloud to look at	0
24961	4292	It's like the adult section at the library	1
24962	4292	Theres no reason why they should be removed off of the shelves	2
24963	4292	I would understand if the little kids could come see the books and movies and be offended by it or scared but thats why you would make a certain section just for older more mature people	3
24964	4292	It would just depend on what offends people and what would make them offended	4
24965	4292	Some things could or would be bad to have little kids see them, but just make sure they couldnt get in the reach of young kids or not matured people	5
24966	4292	The only way i would say remove them if it was really offensive such as racism and things like that	6
24967	4292	Censorship in libraries in my opinion is a good thing	7
24968	4292	Just because the fact of some people might not like the things that would be in a library or things that they have in the library	8
24969	4292	So I would have to say yes on cersorship in the library.	9
24970	4293	There are many books, movies, and magazines on shelves that can offence people in many ways	0
24971	4293	These can be books of war, slavery, and even religion that could aggrevate people and make them feel the need for them to remove those books from the libraries without hesitation	1
24972	4293	There are indeed many books out there that could offence people and could be discriminating, but should those books really be taken out	2
24973	4293	I believe that books were made for a purpose	3
24974	4293	Each book and even magazine has a fact of information regarding what is either happening in the world or what could happen	4
24975	4293	Even for the books that are unrealistic they are also made for a reason and should be allowed to have their place in the library	5
24976	4293	The library has over thousands of books and movies to choose from	6
24977	4293	If there even was one book that someone found discriminating or offensive they could always just pass by it and choose one that suits what they want	7
24978	4293	I feel that it is the person's choice of what they want to read or watch not the books or movies fault	8
24979	4293	The books and movies are also split into genres into which each movie and book belongs in	9
24980	4293	So if you don't specifically want to see something than you can just skip the section the movies or books are in that you find discriminating and go to the ones that you feel okay with	10
24981	4293	There are also many books and movies out there that might seem discriminating but they could actually teach you about life and what could happend and how to solve these problems	11
24982	4293	One example is when I was child growing up I was reading about this girl getting into a car accident and loosing everything just because she was drunk while she was driving	12
24983	4293	My mother didn't want me reading the book, but it actually helped me alot because it taught me the valuable lesson of never drinking and driving, because of reading that book at such a young age and implanting the story in my head I know that I will never in my life do what that girl did to herself	13
24984	4293	This shows that even if a book might seem discriminating and wrong it can still teach people life lessons and danger that they probably wouldn't know about unless they read that book or watched that movie	14
24985	4293	I feel that even if we removed the offensive magazines, books, and movies that don't have any potential what so ever, people would still find a way to get what they were looking for, even if it is from the library or not	15
24986	4293	There are many people that are wrong in this world and banning certain books from the library probably wouldn't stop them from doing what they want to do	16
24987	4293	Music is another thing that shouldn't be that troubled about	17
24988	4293	Some people listen to certain types of music to calm their nerves down	18
24989	4293	One example is the @CAPS1 rapper @ORGANIZATION1	19
24990	4293	His songs consist of severe sadness and frequent cussing, but in his songs are messages that can relate to other people and listening to that certain song might stop them from doing illegal things or even commiting suicide	20
24991	4293	The songs can symbolize their lives and make them know that they are not the only ones living that way and that they aren't always alone in what they do	21
24992	4293	I feel that each book, movie, and magazine has at least one thing that a person can find offensive	22
24993	4293	If we start removing each one that someone finds offencive than there probably wouldn't be a single book left on the library shelves	23
24994	4293	The books we read, the magazines we glance at, and the movies we watch will probably have something offensive in them but I do not think that they should be censored or removed becasue there is always a chance that those books, movies, or magazines could help you out later in life	24
24995	4294	Freedom of speech and the freedom of press is a privelige we as @CAPS1 are lucky to have	0
24996	4294	I don't believe in censorship in libraries	1
24997	4294	Authors, publishers, editors, and directors all have a right to express their opinions in their work	2
24998	4294	If they would like to express some adult subjects in their work that is their choice	3
24999	4294	They have a right as people to protray their books, magazeines, and movies anyway they want	4
25000	4294	We all have the choice to what books and movies we want to check out at libraries	5
25001	4294	Movies are required to have ratings so the audience knows the extent of the maturity you must have to watch the film	6
25002	4294	For example if you are a @NUM1 year old who wants to checkout a movie but, it's rated @CAPS2 that is not the best choice of movie	7
25003	4294	It @MONTH1 not be the best choice because movies rated @CAPS2 let the audience know its for a mature audience over the age of @NUM2	8
25004	4294	As for books, I often use a book review website that allows me to see the content the book has	9
25005	4294	If I see that the book contains material I don't wish to read about or think the material is too mature, I don't read it	10
25006	4294	I hold the power to choose the books I read and the responsibility to choose the books best suited for my age and maturity level	11
25007	4294	There are many ways we can track the content of the things we can checkout	12
25008	4294	Just because a movie or book is released doesn't mean we have to watch or read it	13
25009	4294	We all make choices in our everyday lives.Some are big and some are small	14
25010	4294	Picking a book or film to checkout from a library is a small choice, but it is our choice to choose what we can handle	15
25011	4294	Author's, directors, and editors should not have their work punished if some people don't agree with the content they are putting in their material	16
25012	4294	Everyone's opinion varies on what's right and wrong	17
25013	4294	Therefore if you believe something is inappropriate you have the chocie of not reading or watching it	18
25014	4294	I do believe we are lucky to have this freedom of opinion and speech	19
25015	4294	Although we shouldn't abuse it we must not forget we have no right to tell others how to use this freedom	20
25016	4294	As we have the choice to read what we want to, authors have a choice on what they want to write about	21
25017	4294	Libraries shouldn't take away this freedom that allows us to make our own decisions on what we view or read	22
25018	4295	Do you ever feel like books, music, movie, magazines and etc., are offensive sometimes	0
25019	4295	To my experience of lising to music and watching movies it can be offensive somtimes with out even knowing it	1
25020	4295	I have lisn to rap before and all the cuss words they use, and watching movies with only white people or black people	2
25021	4295	So I think some music, moives and etc., could be taking off	3
25022	4295	If I think somthing is a offensive I pretty much blow it off like its nothing	4
25023	4295	I do that beacuse I have watch @CAPS1 The @CAPS2 the white and black people didnt get a long, and they had to play football to geather	5
25024	4295	Then they finally got along and won the champion game	6
25025	4295	To me I think thats awesome beacause people were offensive, and got over it and now there friends	7
25026	4295	So  dont take @CAPS3 offensive	8
25027	4295	I say that beacuse how do you know that the actor or the writer was or is talking about you	9
25028	4295	I look at this like its a little deal	10
25029	4295	I like @CAPS3 like that I find it entertanment	11
25030	4295	It can also help you learn, about whats happening to our world, and what we have acomplished	12
25031	4295	So I really dont take this @CAPS3 a offensive	13
25032	4295	But, other people can take it offensive and thats there problem	14
25033	4295	There is nothing that can be done its over with	15
25034	4295	If something is a offensive then dont lisn to it or dont watch or read it	16
25035	4295	So dont think its right to pull it of the shelf and abhor it	17
25036	4295	They can have a really good meaning behind it	18
25037	4295	There are many movies, songs and books in the world that are good	19
25038	4295	So dont abominate it and go on in life dont let @CAPS3 get to you	20
25039	4295	Thats why I dont think its right to pull it off the shelf and take it offenisive	21
25040	4295	Thats why I think it not bad to take @CAPS3 offensive.	22
25041	4296	Dear Newspaper,      I would like to start off by saying yes, books, magizines, music, movies, etc., are great for the kids in the library	0
25042	4296	I think thats the best thing for them to do when they dont have anything to do, go to the library and read or work on stuff in the library and I think that some things should be in the library because we are in high school and we need to learn some things here but some of the things we learn are not very appropriate	1
25043	4296	In high school just walking down the hall ways your going to learn alot of things you probably dont need to know yet but when you walk into  a library they dont need to encourage it by putting  books of drugs, alcohol, and sex on the shelves	2
25044	4296	Books about drugs are alright to an extent	3
25045	4296	If your reading about medicanes you can take and being in the doctors office and getting percriptions is alright but when you got books about pot, weed, crank, or meth thats a little much	4
25046	4296	We need to learn about those drugs and what they could do to us if we use them or abuse them but we dont need to know how to roll a blunt or make meth	5
25047	4296	Books about alcohol are the same way	6
25048	4296	We need to know the dangers of drinking but we dont need to know about teen parties and things to do when your drunk	7
25049	4296	Advertisements, magizines, etc., are the worst things for us kids because everyone of them have something to do with drugs, alcohol, or sex and trying to get us to do those thing in high school	8
25050	4296	The front cover of magizines always have people who have got caught with drugs who is dating or sleeping around with who and ik that we will and need to know these things but i dont think we need to read them out of books because then we read it and see how other people did it and we feel the need to do it or try it	9
25051	4296	I believe these books that are over the line about alcohol, drugs, and sex need to be taking out of the librarys so that the kids have something to learn about and ask there parents about	10
25052	4296	I have been in the librarys and I know for a fact that the first books I go for have one of those three invloved in it because those are interesting and we like reading about stories at parties or someone getting pregnant or an @ORGANIZATION1 but also when I read I think about it and I think I want to go to a party they made them sound fun	11
25053	4296	This is what I think about some of those books on the selves and what I think should happen	12
25054	4296	Sinceraly,                                                            @LOCATION1	13
25055	4297	Libraries     Do you go to libraries	0
25056	4297	Many people all over go to libraries for many different reasons	1
25057	4297	Sometimes when you go there, you have to have a reason to be there	2
25058	4297	You also have to be very quite	3
25059	4297	Libraries are very interesting in many ways	4
25060	4297	Some @MONTH1 ask what a library is, well they are good places to go	5
25061	4297	People can go there for many different things	6
25062	4297	Most of the time, when people go to a library, they go to get books	7
25063	4297	Not only can you get books from there, but also go there for school tutouring, for a place to read, and just to go somewhere quite	8
25064	4297	See libraries have many things to do	9
25065	4297	Why do people go to libraries	10
25066	4297	Well I personally do not go to a library but many others do	11
25067	4297	People that like to read go there to get a kind of book they want	12
25068	4297	I would go there for totouring for school, I honestly need it	13
25069	4297	It helps you alot and gets your homework done	14
25070	4297	My mother goes there on some occasions, like, to get information from a book or a computer	15
25071	4297	They have alot of information they you can look for	16
25072	4297	Then there are online geeks, who like to get online for video games	17
25073	4297	I get on the internet but not for video games	18
25074	4297	There is another reason why people go to the library	19
25075	4297	My little sister loves going to the library	20
25076	4297	She is only eight years old	21
25077	4297	Why am I telling you this	22
25078	4297	Well when you go into a library, you can not get a book if you are under age	23
25079	4297	In that case, you have to have parents permission to be able to get one, but not only that, you have to have a library card in order to get a book	24
25080	4297	I no, stupid rules right	25
25081	4297	SO then again you have to have parents permission for that to	26
25082	4297	Well after the permission is all said and done, when you go to get a book, you have to make sure it's you own grade level	27
25083	4297	I have to watch that with my sister all the time because if not, then they will yell at you	28
25084	4297	I personally think that is good for most kids	29
25085	4297	So now you know that libraries are very strict	30
25086	4297	Now that I told you all about libraries, I hope you learned something from it	31
25087	4297	Remember that they are very good places to go to for information, to get books, or just to go somewhere quite	32
25088	4297	You can always find a library around, there are NO @CAPS1	33
25089	4297	Well if you don't like to read or be quite, then you shouldn't go	34
25090	4297	I'm going to leave that to yourself.	35
25091	4298	In @LOCATION1, people like to do many dfferent things for fun	0
25092	4298	Some like to go to movies	1
25093	4298	Others perfer a nice walk through the park	2
25094	4298	Now a days everyone is all stuck up and think that we should not see and or read bad, nasty, offensive things	3
25095	4298	I believe that we should be able to see what ever we want	4
25096	4298	The first reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because we have the right to	5
25097	4298	There are lots of things that we cant do but reading should not be one of those things	6
25098	4298	We shouldnt have to ask some one if a book is ok to read or not	7
25099	4298	Its not fair to those who want to read it	8
25100	4298	I find it very dumb	9
25101	4298	The second reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because if you dont like it, dont read it	10
25102	4298	This is a very simple an straight forward concept	11
25103	4298	Everybody today is worried about what everyone else is doing	12
25104	4298	If yo dont like something then dont pick it up and read it	13
25105	4298	If i knew there was a boook that i didnt like because it was offensive to me, i wouldnt read it	14
25106	4298	Its just that easy	15
25107	4298	The third and final reason why we should be able to read what ever we want is because its none of your bussines what other people do or read	16
25108	4298	Everbody today is so worried about the next guy that its not even funny	17
25109	4298	If we all just worried about our selfs, then we would be better off	18
25110	4298	If i read a book that i found offensive or bad, i wouldnt go around telling others its a bad book and that is should be pulled off the shelfs	19
25111	4298	Its not right and its not fair	20
25112	4298	We should be able to read what ever we want	21
25113	4298	Its our right to read it	22
25114	4298	Also, if you dont like it, then dont read it	23
25115	4298	People today are too worried about other people	24
25116	4298	If other people want to read a book that you find offensive or bad, there is nothing that you can do about it	25
25117	4298	That is the way life works.	26
25118	4299	If you take offense to certian things, you shouldn't read the peices of literature that make you feel like that	0
25119	4299	Ask some of your friends or research the book/magazine before you read it	1
25120	4299	Sometimes the front can be decieving so make sure you read the description first	2
25121	4299	Many people that read certain things @MONTH1 take them the wrong way and think they say something they dont really mean	3
25122	4299	Which is why they take offense to it, but the more you understand a peice of literature the less you are offended	4
25123	4299	You should try to at least accept some of what the book/magazine says just incase you need it in the future	5
25124	4299	You @MONTH1 get upset when you read something for the first time, and @MONTH1 not notice that it could help you when you think about it	6
25125	4299	Thinking about things is a great way to learn how to deal with being offended, just look from both points of view	7
25126	4299	They both could have good ideas and functions to them	8
25127	4299	Try avoiding them if you are still offended by them, don't read a lot of book/magazines that have offensive things in them	9
25128	4299	Ignore the adds on the television or computers that have more than what you need to know in them or if they make you feel uncomfortable watching them	10
25129	4299	If you read them it could make you feel worse or make you mad	11
25130	4299	Sometimes they can even make you stess a little	12
25131	4299	If you are really offended by something the best thing you could do is avoid it	13
25132	4299	Avoiding something helps you to not read them or think about them	14
25133	4299	This works for a lot of situations not just this one, so if you need to get away from the stress just ignore them.	15
25134	4300	Books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we @MONTH1 have never thought about before	0
25135	4300	However, are some books just too much to handle and should not be read	1
25136	4300	Well think what you @MONTH1, but I believe all reading and media materials should stay on their shelves in libraries because people should have a right to know what is in the real world, even some of the bad parts	2
25137	4300	Different assortments of media should definately not leave libraries or be banned from them because people need to be educated in all that exists, they need to know even the bad things in this world so they can hopefully be educated enough about it they can go away from evil acts and help fight against them, and first and foremost it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the option to be who they want to be	3
25138	4300	Though we can only hope that by giving people such knowledge they can rise up and do what is right	4
25139	4300	Even education @DATE1 is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge, but in the long run does this really help people	5
25140	4300	If people were educated enough to know about everything we know and what they themselves as an individual choose to learn, wouldn't that help them from becoming curious and learning lies from an invalid source, instead of the array of resources they would have open to them at a library	6
25141	4300	Each individual should have the right to learn what they want to learn and should not be closed off from any resources, otherwise they @MONTH1 never learn the real truth behind a topic, which would work against the whole point of learning	7
25142	4300	These seekers of knowledge should always be able to seek as they please, so that they @MONTH1 learn and hopefully make new advancements for everyones benefit, but they can only hope to this with proper education	8
25143	4300	Another point to look at is that people need this variety of education, so they can work for causes important to them	9
25144	4300	With knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better	10
25145	4300	Although  this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they oppose something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and what cause they are pushing for	11
25146	4300	The only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics	12
25147	4300	Without certain points of information that could be taken out, people @MONTH1 have no backbone to what they are saying and then they would even hamper other people's learning processes as well	13
25148	4300	Also another reason to not have censorship is that we all have rights in @LOCATION1,and hopefully globaly someday, to be who we want to be in the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hinder anyone else's dreams in our own pursuit	14
25149	4300	People really just need to be who they really are in order to help the world and make differences, because if we were not allowed to be our own individuals then people would never advance	15
25150	4300	Without this advancement, people would have just remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people chose to seek knowledge, and in doing so gave us the technology people have @DATE1	16
25151	4300	Harry @CAPS1 even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them	17
25152	4300	Would he have become such a hit if others didn not believe this as well	18
25153	4300	To change this would go against the rights people have found for themselves, thus meaning if we gave these rights away, people would have regressed	19
25154	4300	People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in librairies	20
25155	4300	These media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives	21
25156	4300	Though there wil;l always be bad media, we must understand even the bad in this world, so that hopefully people will make the choice to combat it	22
25157	4300	We all certainly would not be the people we are @DATE1 without all the influences on us and by taking away even parts of knowledge we would end up only dehabilatating ourselves	23
25158	4300	These choices all help us to hopefully advance and continue forward into the depths of understanding, so that knowledge will continue on forever	24
25159	4301	I believe that if some people don't like a certain book or movie then they should be able to tell the library about that itme and it should be removed from the library	0
25160	4301	The library should allow people who use the library to take away things that are offensive to its customers	1
25161	4301	Some parents who come into a library with their children let their children go off and look at books by themselves which is what my @CAPS1 used to let me do when I was a kid	2
25162	4301	If children are by themselves with no adult supervision and wander into an adult reading section they could look at something bad	3
25163	4301	They could also buy a magazine that looks perfectly fine on the outside but have offensive images on the inside	4
25164	4301	When I was ten years old, my family and I went on vacation to @LOCATION1	5
25165	4301	We were watching a baseball game that was on commercial break one night	6
25166	4301	We were fliping through the channels wating for the game to come on	7
25167	4301	We were all watching the television when an offensive image came on the televison that children's eyes shoudn't see	8
25168	4301	That occurance happened when I nor my parents wanted me to see it	9
25169	4301	That image was an adult image and was meant for adults only, but childrens eyes can see it as well	10
25170	4301	Libraries should think of this when they are puting books and magazines on their shelves	11
25171	4301	They might be making a little bit of money but they are effecting a childs life in a negative way	12
25172	4301	Things like this could happen in a library also because children who are young won't always know what is a childs book and what is an adult magazine	13
25173	4301	Children also might ask their parents for music that the case of the music might look fine on the outside, but have cursing and bad things on the inside	14
25174	4301	This is the reason why all items in a library that are offensive to people should be removed from libraries	15
25175	4301	If people who go to the library don't like something on the shelves they should be able to ask the library to take the item off the shelve	16
25176	4301	The libray might not do it everytime, but taking items off the shelves would make libraries more enjoyable and safe for children	17
25177	4301	If the library doesn't take the items off the shelve it could effect their business in a negative way	18
25178	4301	The library should only take off the items that regular visitors to the library ask for	19
25179	4301	The library shoudn't listen to someone who has visited the library only a few times	20
25180	4301	The library should listen to its customers that visit the library often	21
25181	4301	I think that all offensive images to people that visit the library should be taken off the shelves and removed from the library	22
25182	4301	The library should listen to its customers not only because it could effect their business, but becasue it could effect the lives of children in a positive or negative way.	23
25183	4302	The offensive things found in a library	0
25184	4302	In many libraries now a days there are all kinds of vilent and bad books talking about vilenst	1
25185	4302	Should libraries take these books, movies, or music off the shelfes find out	2
25186	4302	The library should not have to take these tipes of things out of the library	3
25187	4302	If they have bad related books they should just make a different section in the library for them	4
25188	4302	For rated @CAPS1 movies they can have them in the library	5
25189	4302	You have to be over @NUM1 years of age	6
25190	4302	For music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it	7
25191	4302	If the parents dont like it then dont get it	8
25192	4302	They should make different sections in the library for the offensive books that they have	9
25193	4302	Kids under a surtain age should not be allowed to read the books	10
25194	4302	If they still want the book they have to get parents permissition to rent it	11
25195	4302	Rated @CAPS1 movies they should be allowed in the library	12
25196	4302	You just have to be over @NUM1 to go in that area and with an adult	13
25197	4302	If you want to rent a movie you need to have parents permissition	14
25198	4302	You also have to watch this movie with an adult	15
25199	4302	Music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it	16
25200	4302	You can still rent it if your parents say its ok	17
25201	4302	They should make the @CAPS5 behind the counter	18
25202	4302	So that little kids can not see the front of the cases	19
25203	4302	If the parents dont like the libraries rules then dont rent anything from the library	20
25204	4302	So dont take off the offensive books, movie, or @CAPS5	21
25205	4302	If you were head of the library what would you do	22
25206	4302	Take out the offensive things, or just put them in different sections	23
25207	4303	Reading is very popular	0
25208	4303	It is something to do when you are sitting at home and also when you are in the classroom	1
25209	4303	School libraries are filled with defferent varieties of books and magazines and such	2
25210	4303	Some of these books could be arguably offensive to some people	3
25211	4303	These books should not be taken away from the library shelves	4
25212	4303	There are some books that some people find so offensive that they can not even continue to read the rest of the book	5
25213	4303	Whether it be sexual or even political, if the reader finds it offensive they will not read the rest of the book	6
25214	4303	There are books out there that describe in detail sexual scenes and many parents do not want their kids to read these kinds of books	7
25215	4303	This is no reason to remove the books from the library shelves	8
25216	4303	It @MONTH1 be offensive to certain people but if you took it off of the shelves it would not be available for others to read who can handle that kind of story	9
25217	4303	Parents' kids should simply not read these books	10
25218	4303	Libraries can not take the books away all together from readers who enjoy these kinds of books	11
25219	4303	There are also books about politics	12
25220	4303	Majority of people stand firm with politics and do not budge when it comes to discussing what they believe is right or true	13
25221	4303	When a reader comes across a book that is against the way they see politics, there can be a real problem	14
25222	4303	With politics being a serious matter, many people can overreact when someone tells them what they believe and think is true is really not	15
25223	4303	Politicians themselves especially	16
25224	4303	Still, many authors write about political matters and some books can educate the reader about points that they have not yet seen before	17
25225	4303	If a reader does not agree with what the author is writing or they find it offensive, they should not read the book	18
25226	4303	There are plenty of other readers out there that would like to read that book and to learn more about politics	19
25227	4303	If a reader knows that this kind of reading offends them, then they should know better than to pick up the book in the first place	20
25228	4303	Many libraries offer music, movies and magazines to check out and to take home	21
25229	4303	It is true that many of these movies or the lyrics in the songs could strike someone as offensive	22
25230	4303	For this reason, they should not check them out	23
25231	4303	Many people enjoy music or movies that have offensive language	24
25232	4303	It is something that adds to the song or movie	25
25233	4303	People know their limits and if they know the contents then they should stay away	26
25234	4303	As long as there are other readers and people who like those kinds of books and music then they should keep them on the shelf	27
25235	4303	Taking them away would only take away from the number of people who visit the library	28
25236	4303	You could go to your local library and find people looking through the music section, and the music section is the only reason they come to the library in the first place	29
25237	4303	The music and movie section should stay in libraries	30
25238	4303	The people that are checking them out should be mature and responsible enough to know if they find the contents offensive	31
25239	4303	Libraries should not take certain books, movies, and magazines away that some people find offensive	32
25240	4303	Some books and music do have contents that are offensive to some readers and viewers	33
25241	4303	However, if it is offensive to the first person, it does not mean it will be offensive to the next	34
25242	4303	The libraries need to keep these sections in their libraries for all different kinds of readers	35
25243	4303	Reading is an extremely popular activity	36
25244	4303	Readers want a variety of books, music and movies to choose from.	37
25245	4304	In every school or library many people see books that are inappropriate for their taste	0
25246	4304	Everyone has their own opinion, and what might seem offensive to you, @MONTH1 be something that someone might want to know about	1
25247	4304	So should we take the books that only the majority of the people think are offensive off the shelves, or should we keep them anyways	2
25248	4304	Here is what I believe we should do	3
25249	4304	Books are meant for learning and for pleasure not to try to offend anyone	4
25250	4304	They each have their own purpose and there was a reason for why they were written	5
25251	4304	There are tons of books out there that many people dont like, but that doesn't mean someone else doesn't	6
25252	4304	We should keep the books in the schools and in libraries, because @MONTH1 be they might help someone in a way and if they weren't there, how would that person get help if nothing else was avalible	7
25253	4304	One thing we can do is categorize the books by the genre, so that way people know what they are looking for	8
25254	4304	Many people find these books that are 'offensive' because they come across them randomly	9
25255	4304	If each book was put into a certain category then that incedent wouldn't happen	10
25256	4304	It also helps keep everything organized that way	11
25257	4304	So when you go into the library you know what you are looking for, you can just go right to that section and not look at anything else that @MONTH1 be offensive to you	12
25258	4304	Keeping books on shelves is what all libraries and schools intend to do	13
25259	4304	That is the main reason for libraries	14
25260	4304	They help you learn and get information about things that maybe you can't get anywhere else	15
25261	4304	If every library took off the books each person complained about what the point in having the library	16
25262	4304	There would be nothing left	17
25263	4304	In all, everyone is entitled to their opinion and has a right to think that a book is offensive, but the reality is that it was written for a reason	18
25264	4304	If the library or the person who published it thought it was going to be a big deal, they probably wouldnt have put it out there for the world to see	19
25265	4304	So keeep the books on the shelves	20
25266	4305	Going to the library is always a struggle when someone is faced with so many different genres of books	0
25267	4305	That isnt the only choice they are faced with either	1
25268	4305	There is music and magazines too	2
25269	4305	Just within the books, there are so many different subjects and catagories between kids books,  biographies, autobiographies, etc	3
25270	4305	On top of that there are alot of different types of music to fit everyones different styles	4
25271	4305	Some people might say that some of the books and/or music could be found offensive or not appropriate	5
25272	4305	But out of all the meterial in the library, I don't think there should be a problem with staying away from a the things that you might find offensive	6
25273	4305	Therefore I do not think that certain books or music should be kept away from the shelves due to a few self opinions	7
25274	4305	There are multiple different books in a library and just because one might find one book offensive doesnt mean that the book should be pulled off the shelves	8
25275	4305	The reason being is that someone else could find that book as a good resource and @MONTH1 need it for something they are doing	9
25276	4305	People should know what they are looking for at the library and if they think that a book @MONTH1 be offensive then they could keep their self from checking out that book	10
25277	4305	This problem is similar to others around the world	11
25278	4305	For example, when you go to the mall there are shops that you know you like and go to, and you stay away from the ones that you dont like or @MONTH1 find offensive due to the items they sell	12
25279	4305	That doesnt mean that store should be banned from the mall	13
25280	4305	Thats because some people might find that store interesting and want to purchase some of thier items	14
25281	4305	I think the same reasoning goes for different books and meterial at the library	15
25282	4305	A way that a library could adress this problem with out pulling theses books from the shelves is maybe taking a survey from thier local visitors in thier town by asking them what they think on some of the different genres of books and different styles of music	16
25283	4305	After taking this survey the library then could seperate these items into different catagories or sections within the library	17
25284	4305	This could help this problem tremendously due to the fact people could stay away from those sections that they might find offensive and find what they are looking for alot easier	18
25285	4305	I know when I sit down and read im not always caught reading the most popular subjects	19
25286	4305	I like to read subjects such as murder files, drug bust, biographies, and autobiographies	20
25287	4305	And then when it comes to music I listen to a wide variety of music such as hip-hop, country, alternative, rock, etc	21
25288	4305	Some people @MONTH1 find that wierd and unusual but it just goes to show that not everyone wants to read and listen to the same thing	22
25289	4305	Therefore the library should keep the wide selection of different meterial and keep everyone happy	23
25290	4306	I think that they libraries should not remove any of the books they have now	0
25291	4306	If parents or people dont want to read those type of books they dont have to	1
25292	4306	But they should'nt be removed	2
25293	4306	I agree that some books are inappropriate and have bad language in them but thats part of the book and how the story was made	3
25294	4306	When a book is made they way it is and is already published there should'nt be any changes made to it	4
25295	4306	If a story contains a certain scene that a person believes should'nt be in the book, that person needs to put that book back and choose another book they think is appropriate	5
25296	4306	Some people like to read stories with details so they can picture it in there mind	6
25297	4306	I know I do	7
25298	4306	In libraries they have books with inappropriate language and scenes discribed but to a certain age	8
25299	4306	I think you have to be thirteen or older to read them, and thats a good thing because by that age you know things better and your parents should'nt be too worried	9
25300	4306	So in my opinon I dont think they should be removed from libraries	10
25301	4306	On the other hand movies that have scenerios that are disturbing should be removed	11
25302	4306	Movies are a whole different thing then books	12
25303	4306	They show the material that is being described and I dont think teens should be watching that	13
25304	4306	They can be very unappropriate and disturbing to some people like me	14
25305	4306	I would'nt want to watch that in front of my mom or dad and especially a younger sibbling	15
25306	4306	Then again its just my opinion	16
25307	4306	If parents are okay with there child or children watching that then it should'nt be a problem	17
25308	4306	Music is'nt that bad	18
25309	4306	There are a lot of parents who dont want there child or children listening to a sertain type of music because of their religion and what they believe in	19
25310	4306	I totally agree	20
25311	4306	My parents at the beggining would'nt let me listen to music where all they would do is sing about sex and curse over and over	21
25312	4306	As I got older they did'nt care much because I would'nt listen to it as much	22
25313	4306	Im a teen and I also believe that some of the music now in days in not very appropriate for anyone at any age	23
25314	4306	Some of what they sing does'nt even make much sense	24
25315	4306	In libraries I think they should only have music that realates in some how to the books	25
25316	4306	Magazines are not really a problem	26
25317	4306	Most of the magazines talk about beauty and fashion tips	27
25318	4306	They have horoscopes and give advise	28
25319	4306	A lot of the magazines keep people updated on celeberties and there life style	29
25320	4306	It has some what gossip	30
25321	4306	There mostly for older teens and grown ups	31
25322	4306	For younger teens and kids there's more appropriate magazines where they talk about younger celeberties	32
25323	4306	This is my point of view on things	33
25324	4306	I know that a lot of people dont entirely agree with me but this is what I think	34
25325	4306	I also know that there @MONTH1 be a lot of people who agree with me and they'll most likely give the same reasons as I did to support their choice	35
25326	4307	Do you believe that certain materials	0
25327	4307	books, music, movies, and magazines should be removes from the shelf if it is offensive to some people	1
25328	4307	Accordingly, I do not believe this way	2
25329	4307	If we were to take books off a shelf for everyone who thought it was offensive, we wouldn't have any books left on the shelf	3
25330	4307	According to my prior knowledge, I know certain materials will affect different people in different ways	4
25331	4307	I have had my own experience when in svhool	5
25332	4307	Some people do not want to say the pledge due to saying 'one nation, under @CAPS1.' We all have various opinions on subjects	6
25333	4307	so we all will react differntly	7
25334	4307	However, that doesn't mean we should take away something he or she finds offensive	8
25335	4307	others find it appropriate	9
25336	4307	Observing others when in offensive situations @MONTH1 help find a solution to these problems	10
25337	4307	The solution is certainly not to remove what some find offensive for many people will disagree until eternity	11
25338	4307	Censorship in libraries should be based on seperation	12
25339	4307	Materials that fit under one catagory should be put in one section	13
25340	4307	Often times, this seperation helps people find what they need and not be offended	14
25341	4307	In our own constitution it states that all @CAPS2 are free	15
25342	4307	freedom of speech in particular	16
25343	4307	All materials are written by someone with an opinion so by taking their books off the shelf, we are taking their freedom of speech away	17
25344	4307	It is how they express themselves	18
25345	4307	If someone finds it offensive then they should quite simply not read it	19
25346	4307	Removing the material might frustrate and offend the author or other readers	20
25347	4307	It is plain and simple: We shouldn't remove certain materials due to someone finding it offensive	21
25348	4307	Censorship in libraries should be based on seperation, not people getting offended easily	22
25349	4307	It's based on choices	23
25350	4307	People should get to choice what they want to read or watch without others taking it away from them	24
25351	4307	So now what do you believe	25
25352	4307	Should certain materials be removed	26
25353	4308	Have you ever sondered through the libray just to specifically find that one good book, magazine, or even cd that didn't involve inapropiate material for once	0
25354	4308	You feel like a little kid in the shopping mall just inpatiently waiting to find that one toy, but it never shows up	1
25355	4308	You spend seconds, minutes, even hours still slowly pacing back and forth shelf to shelf, and finally you find it and you open it and see the most innapropriate picture ever, or maybe listen to the most vulgure language, or even take a skim through the most offensive reading yet	2
25356	4308	Do you wish it'd change	3
25357	4308	I visit the library every time after i finish my book, I have loved reading from the time I was little	4
25358	4308	Lately i feel like my reading iterest has gone down though, not due to my act of being involved in other things, but possibly because lately I feel like every book I pick up comes off offensive	5
25359	4308	For example I went to  the check out a new book, I was mind boggled at this time because unlike usual I had no clue on which book I was even interested on to read next	6
25360	4308	The librarian directed me to there new best seller and said addressed it and said it was as hard to put down as a lollipop	7
25361	4308	I checked it out and after the first paragraph I wanted to throw up	8
25362	4308	This book and too gory and i felt like it downgraded women, I was anything but satisfied	9
25363	4308	This wasn't the first book me or my friends had checked out like this, and I have a feeling it won't be the last	10
25364	4308	I just hope i could check out a book not so offensive and actually worth my time, but it seems like lately they are all changing and becoming too much for me, and it really upsets me	11
25365	4308	Our library seems to be over packed with magazines, which isn't a bad thing because I love them	12
25366	4308	I label magazines as a light read and very good at passing free time	13
25367	4308	I never get tired of all the pictures, all the gossip, and all the jokes at the end	14
25368	4308	Lately my opinion has changed though, these magazines are starting to alter and I don't like it	15
25369	4308	It seems as if I can't open my page without seeing a half dressed girl, some innapropriate advertisement, or even tons of personal display of affection	16
25370	4308	Seeing these vulgare images are enough to make me not only flip the page, but also never second guess about opening a magazine again	17
25371	4308	Music is like a drug to me, and I am addicted	18
25372	4308	There is never a day that goes by that I do not listen to music, but lately music just isn't the same	19
25373	4308	I go to the library to check out some new cd's and it seems everything I bother listening to uses every curse word out there	20
25374	4308	I was furious after my purchase, but also disappointed that people actaully sell this garbage	21
25375	4308	I am somebody who listens to music to relax, not develop a new innapropriate vocabulary	22
25376	4308	I know there are plenty of good books, magazines, and music out there	23
25377	4308	We just need to find it again	24
25378	4308	I hope that we can banish these offensive, vulgar, and unnesesary items at the library	25
25379	4308	I know i'd greatly appreciate it, and from what I heard many others would too	26
25380	4308	We want reading utensils worth reading, we want magazines our eyes won't mind to take a glance at, and we won't music that won't pollute our brains	27
25381	4311	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelfs if someone thinks they are offensive	0
25382	4311	Just because one person finds them offensive doesnt mean that they should be taken away from others who @MONTH1 like them	1
25383	4311	People are different, therefore we like different types of things	2
25384	4311	Different music, books, movies, and magazines	3
25385	4311	If you find it offensive, dont listen look or read it	4
25386	4311	Listen to the music you like, watch the movies you like, and read the books and magazines you enjoy	5
25387	4311	But just because you dont like something dont try and take it away from those that do	6
25388	4311	People are very different in many ways	7
25389	4311	But let someone express who they are through their likes and dislikes	8
25390	4311	Censorship has always been an issue but i believe that if people would just stick to what they know and like and leave everything and everyone else alone all would be ok	9
25391	4311	I understand that some people might find some things that are on the shelfs today offensive	10
25392	4311	But if you dont like it dont look at it or listen to it	11
25393	4311	Let it go and stick to what you know and like	12
25394	4311	After all the world is a very diverse place and we were not all made the same.	13
25395	4312	Do you believe that if you just take a book off a shelf you or your kids won't be exposed to offensive material	0
25396	4312	If you do, then you are wrong	1
25397	4312	You can't isolate your family or other families from the world because you are scared that they might pick up something bad	2
25398	4312	Everyday, whether they read a book or not they are still exposed to vulger behavior	3
25399	4312	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	4
25400	4312	But if I have the right ot remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	5
25401	4312	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any us.' @CAPS1 quote by Katherine Paterson also helps understand the concept	6
25402	4312	If someone were to take a book off of a shelf at their home, a public library, or maybe even a store that they found offensive at any point in the book, then there would be no books left for children and even adults to read	7
25403	4312	In every book there is some form of material that people @MONTH1 not be a fan of	8
25404	4312	There would soon be nothing left	9
25405	4312	There isn't a day that goes by that a kid doesn't hear something offensive	10
25406	4312	Even at school, where it's supervised, children bring words that they have heard their parents say or things that they have seen their parents do, and they share them with other kids	11
25407	4312	You can't protect them from every small encounter they are faced with	12
25408	4312	Some books are by far more offensive than others, but are you going to give a kid a book that has vulgar language or, will you give a child a book that's about @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 running out of honey in his jar	13
25409	4312	Most children don't go to a library or a store without super vision if their parent is @CAPS1 careful about just books	14
25410	4312	Therefore, their parents probably aren't going to allow them to pick up a obscene book or magazine, and in fact they would probably try to hide it from them	15
25411	4312	If a book is put on a shelf then it is there for those who enjoy that material	16
25412	4312	If you can't make the world kid safe, then why would you try to make a library the same exact way	17
25413	4312	There are other people out there that might find the very material that you that is offensive fascinating, and a library is there to suit everyone's needs	18
25414	4312	It isn't there for just children.	19
25415	4313	I think that we should remove certain things like movies, music and books should definitely be a debate because in these days people are doing things that they never done before	0
25416	4313	For an example music, music is a great cause of things that people motivate to do things and get really into the songs	1
25417	4313	They try to do the same things as what there favorite artist or actor does	2
25418	4313	I hear some songs and they talk about illegal things and I look around the world I hear children talking about those things and they tell there parents what is that 	3
25419	4313	But they just dont want to tell them the truth but once these kids get older they will know what it is and it will be there choice if they want to follow that path or think about something else	4
25420	4313	But about the people who are singing this, they're putting it in a way that is not bad you could do this all the time and enjoy it with out getting introuble and in reality these kids are blind and dont know what there getting them selves into	5
25421	4313	Also, many books have offensive language that kids read all the time but people dont even notice	6
25422	4313	That's how kids could get introuble in school because they learn a new word in some book they never read or cant even read cause there to young to understand but they do it anyways beacause of curiosity, they dont know what there doing	7
25423	4313	Thats a way how a child becomes bad cause person when he or she becomes older cause they learned things that they shouldnt have learned	8
25424	4313	I think that we as a good country should make sections into what people can read and cant read, and it should depend how old is the person	9
25425	4313	Some school librarys, have movies that kids could watch and it could be if your a elementry school, middle school etc	10
25426	4313	But some of these movies have offensive language and some appropriate scenes, that kids would want and learn how to do those type of things	11
25427	4313	Or how they see the actors in the movie and they curse and they think is cool cause there doing it as well	12
25428	4313	I think that elementry students should watch only pg movies, middle school pg @NUM1 and down, and for the high school, we should be able to see basically any movie, but in the same time I think most of the high school students have to be more mature, thats probably why we still dont have the priblige to see any movie cause peolpe dont know how to handle them selves	13
25429	4313	Finally, I really think they should minimum some movies, music and books cause kids are learning things they shouldnt be learning until they get older, and that those three things change the world in so many diffrent ways, some are good but most of them are bad, these are my opinions.	14
25430	4314	There are a lot of issues concerning offensive material that are used for entertainment purposes	0
25431	4314	Sometimes these things should not be on the shelves	1
25432	4314	Such as movies, books, magazines, etc., they can be seriously offenseive to other people that are different races or different religions	2
25433	4314	Censorship can be used to solve this problem, like in the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, it was used to keep books out of the picture completely	3
25434	4314	To keep the society from becoming offended, or for that matter, thinking	4
25435	4314	However in this matter it is the complete opposite, having all kinds of negative material and not caring what it can do to other people, or @MONTH1 damage other people	5
25436	4314	However this can also be argued	6
25437	4314	The people that are offended by the material, wether religious or race, really don't have to be around the material in the first place	7
25438	4314	For example if the material is in a library, then the people don't need to go to the library	8
25439	4314	In conclusion people don't have to be near the offensive stuff if they are offended, but people should not be so cruel also.	9
25440	4315	Personally in my opinion I have no problem with anything found in libraries today	0
25441	4315	Yes, there will always be something you disagree with, but it's not hurting you so just ignore it	1
25442	4315	Kids don't walk around in the adult section of the library they go to the kid section so there is no need to worry about them	2
25443	4315	Kids are maturing at a much younger age these days	3
25444	4315	I believe there is no harm in libraries, it is a place where you go to get all the information you can	4
25445	4315	So why would you remove valuable information	5
25446	4315	The library is a place for all people no matter who you are, how old or ugly	6
25447	4315	Everyone can use the library for any reason, many times invloving school	7
25448	4315	Personally I do not much use public libraries, but I often come to the school library to get stuff done or find a specific book	8
25449	4315	For example you might find @CAPS1 to be a horrible person that you don't want your kid knowing about	9
25450	4315	For me I am @CAPS2 I want to learn more about my own culture no matter of how bad it is	10
25451	4315	So why take that information away from me	11
25452	4315	Taking away a learning experience just becuase a group of people don't like the book does not mean everyone dosn't like it	12
25453	4315	I want to learn knowledge about myself and where I come from	13
25454	4315	Everyone is going to have their own views and beliefs	14
25455	4315	Overall think the library is not a place to take things away when any one is welcome	15
25456	4315	It is a place to get away from it all, I think they should leave them just how they are.	16
25457	4316	I do not think people should take books off the shelves because the town libraries have those types of books	0
25458	4316	People should enjoy reading all types of books	1
25459	4316	Some people only read different books	2
25460	4316	Little kids like fantasy and picture books, teenagers like romance, and others like nonfiction	3
25461	4316	It should not matter what other people think	4
25462	4316	If people brought books off the shelves then what will the other people read	5
25463	4316	Before you bring books off the shelves, you should ask and write down what other people like instead of doing what you think is right	6
25464	4316	Think about what would happen if u brought down books off the shelves	7
25465	4316	What would happen	8
25466	4316	I will tell you, you would lose customers	9
25467	4316	If you don't want children to read inappropriate books, then you should make a card saying that your parents give them permition to read those books	10
25468	4316	If that won't work, then make an age limit	11
25469	4316	Have the parents show you their berth certificate	12
25470	4316	Have a resticted section in the library	13
25471	4316	In order to get a book from the resticted section, then have a parent sign a note saying that their allowed	14
25472	4316	Children the age of thirteen and under should not be given magazines	15
25473	4316	If their the age of fourteen and up, then they can get a magazine	16
25474	4316	Music should not matter to parents, so there should be no problem there	17
25475	4316	If the movies are bought by the parents, then there should be no problem there either	18
25476	4316	The other things you can figure it out on your own	19
25477	4316	This is what I think should happen to books in a library	20
25478	4316	I told you how a library should work	21
25479	4316	I told you what I thought should go on in the library	22
25480	4316	I will give you some advise	23
25481	4316	Think before you do	24
25482	4316	That is all I am going to tell you.	25
25483	4317	I beleive that all materials should be allowed in libraries, because we all have the right to choose what we want to read, listen to and watch	0
25484	4317	Even if people banned some books from the libray, other people would find a way to get them	1
25485	4317	we as the people of aAmerica have the right to live freely, which also includes the right to read freely	2
25486	4317	As for music and movies i think we have let ourselves go a little too far	3
25487	4317	We have made pornography an easily obtainable thing, and music that promotes sex, drugs, violence, and alcohol	4
25488	4317	The only thing keeping us from pure evil is the @ORGANIZATION1 and their ratings on movies, music, and television	5
25489	4317	With magazines its a little more complicated than the others, maga zines have their own set of standards	6
25490	4317	We all know about @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and @CAPS2, but think about all of the magazines that we dont see	7
25491	4317	The ones that stay behind closed doors and rarely ever come out.	8
25492	4318	Books, magazines, movies, and music are created with a huge diversity	0
25493	4318	Fiction, @ORGANIZATION1, horror, fashion, sciencefiction, and many more categories of literature are made	1
25494	4318	There is something out there everyone will enjoy	2
25495	4318	What would you do if you did not have the choice to read, listen to, or watch the materials you like because someone else had an ill opinion of it	3
25496	4318	Everyone has an opinion	4
25497	4318	It @MONTH1 be in favor of something or it @MONTH1 not be	5
25498	4318	I believe every book, movie, magazine, and other piece of literature should have a rightful place on the shelf	6
25499	4318	To some people it @MONTH1 be offensive, but that does not mean they have to read it	7
25500	4318	Someone @MONTH1 enjoy a piece of work  another finds offensive	8
25501	4318	It is all a matter of opinion	9
25502	4318	The opinion of one person should not effect materials being able to be on a shelf or not	10
25503	4318	If you walked into a libraray and the shelves were filled with books, but only books everyone had a good opinion about the shelves wouldn't seem very full	11
25504	4318	It is hard to get two people to agree on the same thing	12
25505	4318	Imagine trying to get everyone to agree on the literature in a public libraray	13
25506	4318	Censorship is understandble to an extent, but I believe the libraries should organize all their literature into categories and sections	14
25507	4318	In these categoires and section people @MONTH1 look for the materials they wish to see and avoid the offensive materials they do not	15
25508	4318	Libraries have rated @CAPS1 movies	16
25509	4318	Many people could consider rated @CAPS1 movies to be offensive, but many people could enjoy watching rated @CAPS1 movies	17
25510	4318	Who wins, the people who find then offensive or the people who enjoy them	18
25511	4318	It is a hard choice to make	19
25512	4318	I believe the libraries should carry the movies and if someone finds them offensive they should simply not watch them	20
25513	4318	The same goes for books, magazines, and music	21
25514	4318	If you find it offensive simply do not read it or listen to it	22
25515	4318	There are hundreds of different sytles of writing, plots of movies, lyrics of songs, and covers of magazines	23
25516	4318	They have such a diversity because everyone has a different opinion of the lyrics, covers, styles, and plots	24
25517	4318	They can not censor things just because some people find them offensive	25
25518	4318	Others @MONTH1 enjoy them	26
25519	4318	What would you do if your favorite book was not allowed in your public lirbaray	27
25520	4321	It is known that anybody is able to rent books, movies, music, and magazines in libraries	0
25521	4321	It is also known that some of the material in libraries @MONTH1 be offensive or inapropriet	1
25522	4321	While some people beleive that such items should be removed from the shelves, I beleive that books, magazines, movies, and music should not be removed from the shelves	2
25523	4321	People should be able to read, listen, or watch watever they want to, if someone doesn't want something that they find offensive in their house then he or she doesn't have to get it, and it doesn't mean that something that seems offensive still isn't enjoyable	3
25524	4321	The most important reason why I beleive that items that appear to be offensive should not be removed from library shelves is because people should be able to read, listen, or watch watever they want to	4
25525	4321	Anybody is entitled to his or her own preference	5
25526	4321	Some people prefer @CAPS1 rated movies or music with explicit content	6
25527	4321	If that's what people are interensted in then so be it	7
25528	4321	Anybody should not have to stop renting something that they want just because someone else doesn't want them to	8
25529	4321	Furthermore, if someone doesn't want something that they find offensive in his or her house then just don't get it	9
25530	4321	Noone is forcing anyone to listen to or watch something that they don't want	10
25531	4321	It is actually a very simple matter	11
25532	4321	It's a choice whether someone wants to watch or listen to what they want, and they don't really have the right to be able to tell someone else that they can't watch or listen to what they want	12
25533	4321	If someone doesn't perfer something then they don't have to get it	13
25534	4321	Finally, just because something seems offesnsive doesn't mean that it still isn't enjoyable	14
25535	4321	The @CAPS5 example that I can think of is a movie that is @CAPS1 rated	15
25536	4321	Just because a movie is rated @CAPS1 doesn't mean that it still doesn't have a good story or moral to it	16
25537	4321	Their are plenty of rated @CAPS1 movies that have won @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and plenty of other rewards	17
25538	4321	Another example is the singer @ORGANIZATION1	18
25539	4321	While his music @MONTH1 be offensive, their are still many people that enjoy it	19
25540	4321	Certain things that offend people can be enjoyed by other people	20
25541	4321	In conclusion, noone has the right to be able to stop anyone from renting what they want from a library	21
25542	4321	People just really need to mind their own business and not worry about what other people find enjoyable	22
25543	4321	Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are only offensive if certain people beleive that they are	23
25544	4321	People can only choose what they want, and nothing more	24
25545	4323	Should there be cenorship in the Libraries or not	0
25546	4323	Many people have there own personal view on this subject	1
25547	4323	Everyone should know their own boundaries of what they know is appropriate to look at and what isn't	2
25548	4323	Libraries shouldn't have to remove books and etc	3
25549	4323	that they themselves have purchased to get	4
25550	4323	Now they want them cenored	5
25551	4323	i don't think that is very right	6
25552	4323	Libraries should take all the cenored material and make a part of the library where the customers can't see from the main section and it would be open to the customers who would like to go in that specific section to check out a book or anything else that @MONTH1 apply to that section	7
25553	4323	The library was build for anyone who just wanted to go to a place to escape the troubles of their own world and just go sit in a library and read	8
25554	4323	Not everyone goes to the library for a book, some go to listen to music, some go to read a magazine, well whatever it is for the libraries can't take out the material that people go there just go get	9
25555	4323	How do they expect customers to come back if they're taking material out of the library	10
25556	4323	The internet and @CAPS1 is way more offensive than material in a library so what gives them the right to say get all your offensive inappropriate material out of the library	11
25557	4323	If libraries have to do that then so should all the other entertainment industries	12
25558	4323	Finally every library should have their own control over what they think is best for their own facility	13
25559	4323	My opinion says we should just move the material else where in the building, in it's own little wing or something	14
25560	4323	Where people could if they would like to go in and check something out but if people didn't want to go in they sure don't have to	15
25561	4323	Everyone has thier own personal opinion on this subject, and well i gave you mine	16
25562	4324	I think that any book or movie should have some warning sighns apon it, to insure that all peaople know what they are going to experience before reading or seeing anything	0
25563	4324	sSome movies or books read or watched, should have an age limit too	1
25564	4324	Some of the things people find offensive, other people @MONTH1 not and if taken all of the stuff out of movies or books @MONTH1 cause people not to go see or read as much movies or books	2
25565	4324	In alot of music some things might be offensive, but if you don't apriciate what they say in the song then dont listen to that group	3
25566	4324	There are some rap artist that say some things people might not like but, you dont have to listen to them there are alot more bands and diffrent kinds of music to choose from	4
25567	4324	It would b hard taken stuff out of movies and music like that because it might take alot of what the people want to see	5
25568	4324	In magazines alot of people including i like hearing the trooth about celebrities and interesting facts about people and movies, that alot of people @MONTH1 not know	6
25569	4324	If parents dont like there children reading those kinds of books have them go buy a set that they will enjoy haveing there kids read.	7
25570	4325	My name is @CAPS1 and my views on censorship in libraries are that if any material that are found offensive should be take off the shelves	0
25571	4325	I have never came across a material that was offensive to me, but maybe someone else has and it really offended them	1
25572	4325	I'm not the type of person who would start an argument but i am a type of person who will speak whats on my mind and tell you what i believe in	2
25573	4325	People are concerned about if libraries take off certain kinds of books that their will not be books left on the shelves for anyone else	3
25574	4325	I have to say there are other places you can buy books at beside the libraries such as stores as in @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and etc	4
25575	4325	Like i said i have never came across a book that i think should be pulled off the shelf, but of course i don't read a whole lot either but the books i have read i have never came a crossed any that were terrible	5
25576	4325	Books that have like how people can kill themselves, or how people get pregnant, and so on, them can be pulled off the shelves, but if you have a child in the library they shouldnt even be in the adult book section anyways, they should be in the kids book section	6
25577	4325	I have never heard of a kid book that is terrible and that should be pulled off the shelf	7
25578	4325	Most authors are smarter then that, or at least i would hope so	8
25579	4325	Music is a whole story its self	9
25580	4325	In my opinon if you don't want your kids to listen to adult music then don't let them	10
25581	4325	I know a lot of music that is bad and that i would never let my children listen to it but i know well enough if i don't want them to listen to it them i'm not going to play it while their around	11
25582	4325	I grew up around rap music so thats all i listen to, but when i have kids i know what they will be able to listen to and what they wont be able to listen to	12
25583	4325	Movies is the one that i have a problem with the most because in libraries, and other places such as, @ORGANIZATION1, and book stores they just put out movies for EVERYONE to see and it doesn't matter what's on the cover or what it's called	13
25584	4325	Now movies with bad covers and bad titles could be pulled off the shelves such as all the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' movies	14
25585	4325	The name of the movies aren't bad but the movie its self is not for a child to see so why even have it out on shelves for kids to see and want to watch it	15
25586	4325	Magazines and etc i don't have a big problem with because libraries don't have bad ones, but book stores do such as 'playboy and play girl' but they are usually put back in the very back behind all other magazines so children can't see them only adults can	16
25587	4325	The only way a child would see them is only if you point them out	17
25588	4325	I think i've said all i can say about my opinions and my experiences about books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries that should or shouldn't be pulled off the shelves	18
25589	4325	I havn't had a lot of experience but maybe that's because i don't have kids yet, i guess i will find out when i do have kids	19
25590	4325	I happy to explain my experiences and opinions to people who really care and want to know	20
25591	4326	Library Censorship     Libraries shouldn't have 'offensive' books removed from shelves	0
25592	4326	Parent supervision, librarian supervision, and your own common sense are three of the reasons why books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are considered to be offensive	1
25593	4326	Parent supervision is one of the top priorities for knowing what your children read	2
25594	4326	If they don't want their children to grow up being 'stupid' then they should teach them to focus on educational books more	3
25595	4326	When they see their child in a row of books that they think is inappropriate, then they should remove their child from that area and take them to another area	4
25596	4326	The librarian's supervision is also an important priority	5
25597	4326	Maybe they don't know the children's actual age, but if the librarian sees them in a place that they think is inappropriate for someone around their age, show them another book shelf	6
25598	4326	Just like parents, librarians will try to find an educational book that the child @MONTH1 enjoy	7
25599	4326	But, librarians obviously like to read since they are around books all day, so the child @MONTH1 be lucky and the librarian finds an adventure book for the child, or something else that the child finds interesting	8
25600	4326	The person's common sense is also a reason why 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from libraries	9
25601	4326	Most people know how old they are and what kind of books they should read	10
25602	4326	If they are in an area of the library that other people @MONTH1 think is inappropriate for them to read, go to a different area	11
25603	4326	Once again, I don't think there should be a censorship in libraries	12
25604	4326	If parents want their children to read books that won't 'rot your brain' then they should observe what books their child reads, trust the librarian to show them the correct books to read, and expect their child to have good common sense	13
25605	4328	No, the books and etc	0
25606	4328	should not be moved ,because anybody can be interested in them	1
25607	4328	Someone could come in the library looking for any of them items and can't find it because the library removed them	2
25608	4328	First, there will be no reason for removing the books from the library unless more new books and etc	3
25609	4328	are coming in	4
25610	4328	Everyone is into different materials, books and stuff	5
25611	4328	That's why I say do not remove the items	6
25612	4328	People might come in the library looking for a book that they want	7
25613	4328	If that person can find it they might complain, or take there bussiness else where	8
25614	4328	Then the library could start losing bussiness	9
25615	4328	Second, if they library start losing bussines it might be forced to close down.Then if the library close down the people who come there often won't have no place to study or work or nothing	10
25616	4328	What if those people don't have transportation they will not be able to get to another library	11
25617	4328	The owner of the library can lose money if it close down, because everyone don't have computer's and books at home	12
25618	4328	They can come do there research and rent books	13
25619	4328	Third, some people go to the library for peace and quiet, and the library is there only place	14
25620	4328	Little children go to the library looking for books and etc	15
25621	4328	to and if they can't find the book they want they might start crying	16
25622	4328	If they start crying people who are working can be disturbed	17
25623	4328	Then that person or people who are disturbed might leave and never come back and thats money lost	18
25624	4328	Students school's might not have the book they are looking for, and they come to the library and the library don't have it that student won't have a book	19
25625	4328	In conclusion, these are some reason and examples why I don't believe the books and etc	20
25626	4328	should be taken out of the library	21
25627	4328	Someone can be really interested in them items and they come to the library search for them and can't find them.	22
25628	4329	You are the mother or father of a young child, and you take them to the library	0
25629	4329	While there, you see some advertising for a new book	1
25630	4329	The sign is all bright and flashy, so you stop to read it	2
25631	4329	It turns out to be advertising a book and some movies that you believe should not even be available here, for they are far to inappropriate and offensive	3
25632	4329	What would you do	4
25633	4329	Personally, I believe that if you see something like that, that you believe is offensive, you should say something	5
25634	4329	Talk to the librarian and state your case about what is going on	6
25635	4329	Having offensive articles in a public library where kids of all ages go to do their homework, is just plain wrong	7
25636	4329	What if that certain library had no restrictions on who checked out what	8
25637	4329	So many kids could check things like that out, and not even know what it actually is	9
25638	4329	Could you imagine your child coming home from the library, and handing you a book, magazine, or movie that was way beyond anything they should ever see at that age	10
25639	4329	It would be disasterous	11
25640	4329	I @MONTH1 not have children, but I do have younger cousins	12
25641	4329	I know for a fact that if they brought home something inapproproate or offensive, their parents would be having a major talk with the librarian	13
25642	4329	Libraries should have major restrictions on what gets checked out by who	14
25643	4329	For example, my library has three different kinds of library cards	15
25644	4329	One card is just to check out regular books	16
25645	4329	Another is so you can check out movies, music, and books	17
25646	4329	Then the third and final card is so you can check out books, music, and movies from the adult section in a small room at the back of the library	18
25647	4329	However, to even be eligible for the third card, you have to be eighteen or older	19
25648	4329	I strongly believe that if a library does carry materials some @MONTH1 find offensive, they need to be kept in a small room at the back of the library, or behind the librarians desk	20
25649	4329	This way, noone who does not want to see the materials doesn't have to	21
25650	4329	If someone did want to see or check out these materials, they should need proof that they are eighteen or older	22
25651	4329	This would make it easier for the librarian to keep track of who looks at or checks out the materials	23
25652	4329	Another thing, what if someone finds something offensive that someone else doesn't	24
25653	4329	Well, I honestly think that at least two or three people should comment on it being inappropriate or offensive, before it is actually taken off the shelf	25
25654	4329	If more than one person does say something, the librarian should place the book, magazine, movie, music, ect., in with the other offensive materials, where there is an age restriction	26
25655	4329	This is how it is at my neighboorhood library, and I strongly believe that this library is a model for all libraries wanting to have more restrictions	27
25656	4329	If all libraries had more restrictions, it would be better off for everyone	28
25657	4329	Parents would not have to worry about their young children wandering around and finding something that is totally wrong for them	29
25658	4329	Older teenagers and young adults would be able to get their homework or projects accomplished without having all the distractions of the offensive materials	30
25659	4329	In conclusion, I hope you take all that I have said to heart	31
25660	4329	I hope you write an article talking about the restrictions in libraries, and how they would make everything better off	32
25661	4329	Thank you for taking the time to read this	33
25662	4331	I have seen some turely a offensive books on the sheilf of libraries	0
25663	4331	Book that make you worry about what would happen if a child @NUM1, @NUM2, or @NUM3 looked at thes books since that is where their mind absorbs the most knowledge but what if this knowledge was offensive to a race of people or a persons religion	1
25664	4331	This childern are the furter of are species	2
25665	4331	This should be censored in libraries	3
25666	4331	Tried to a imagine if they had looked at books writen @CAPS1 and other nazi members during nazi @CAPS2 rule	4
25667	4331	Mabey they looked at a book by @PERSON1 or other famours killers	5
25668	4331	If they saw photo book about the massive jew death camps in europe	6
25669	4331	Movies that show war torn battle such as @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, world war @NUM4, or world war @NUM5	7
25670	4331	The famours movie 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4' a movie based on the crulty of the @ORGANIZATION1 and the @CAPS5	8
25671	4331	This is my view on censorship to protect childern from the a offensive things in or on books, music, movies, magasines	9
25672	4331	Their should be censored in all things childern can get in to	10
25673	4331	Imagine the world where the was no corntal media what they could put on	11
25674	4332	The library is a public place	0
25675	4332	Everyone is allowed acces to the library	1
25676	4332	It supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about	2
25677	4332	There are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries	3
25678	4332	Books, music, movies, etc, they all can be found there	4
25679	4332	Since they all can be found, censorship in libraries should not be allowed	5
25680	4332	Genres were created for a reason	6
25681	4332	Certain items have different forms to them	7
25682	4332	There are many forms of music	8
25683	4332	Classical, rock, and blues are some examples	9
25684	4332	Since music is categorized in such a way, there should  be no need for them not to be on the shelves at a library	10
25685	4332	If a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that certain genre can be avoided	11
25686	4332	There is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds it offensive	12
25687	4332	In the @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 people are given many rights that are often taken for granted	13
25688	4332	The freedom of speech is one	14
25689	4332	It is a privilege that if taken away would tear @CAPS3 a part	15
25690	4332	The freedom to say what you please also includes singing	16
25691	4332	Certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there	17
25692	4332	Just because a certain group of individuals finds the type of music offensive, does not mean everyone also thinks that way	18
25693	4332	For this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library	19
25694	4332	Another freedom given to the @CAPS2 people is the freedom of press	20
25695	4332	Anything put onto paper is legal	21
25696	4332	Criticizing the government or fantasising about school, it is all legal	22
25697	4332	Books can be offensive to many people	23
25698	4332	They can persuade one in ways that is unbelievable	24
25699	4332	Like music, books have many categories	25
25700	4332	Whatever is put inside those books is allowed to be there no matter what	26
25701	4332	Movies are located at libraries as well	27
25702	4332	They are categorized just as much as books and music	28
25703	4332	The term ' @CAPS5 judge a book by it's cover' is true sometimes	29
25704	4332	This can also be used with movies	30
25705	4332	The title of a moive or book will tell what it is about	31
25706	4332	Certain movies that are not meant to be seen by children are rated @CAPS6 or @NUM1	32
25707	4332	These ratings help censor things to a certain extent	33
25708	4332	It is not illegal for a library to have a rated @CAPS6 movie	34
25709	4332	It is illegal however to check one out to a child of a young age	35
25710	4332	Censorship should not be allowed in libraries	36
25711	4332	All types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries	37
25712	4332	From books to videogames there are ratings and generes	38
25713	4332	If someone is offended by these types of entertainment they should not visit that section of the library	39
25714	4332	It is not illegal to have certain types of music, books, movies, etc inside a library	40
25715	4332	As long as no laws are being broken, there should be no problem.	41
25716	4333	Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
25717	4333	I do not think it should matter weather we have music, movies or magazines in the library	1
25718	4333	Some people like to come in the library to relax and look at a magazine or listen to some music	2
25719	4333	I do not think it bothers anybody by what other people are doing there, if it is not bothering them it should not bother anybody else	3
25720	4333	I see people sometimes reading a book and listening to music	4
25721	4333	it does not bother me when they do this	5
25722	4333	It is a way for them to drown out the world and enjoy a good book	6
25723	4333	There is only one reason why we should keep certain materials out of the library	7
25724	4333	It is that some people get very loud when there looking at magazines, or when there music is turned up way to loud	8
25725	4333	Other than that I do not think we should keep those types of materials in the librarys	9
25726	4333	I am a reader my self and I like to read in peace	10
25727	4333	So I like to listen to my music while I am reading	11
25728	4333	I also like to read magazines every once and awhile	12
25729	4333	It is real relaxing to me	13
25730	4333	Those are my reasons on why it should not matter weather we have those types of materials in the library	14
25731	4334	Do I think that books, movies, music or magazines should be removed from the library	0
25732	4334	No I don't I think that should be removed only because if you remove them your probably going to lose more costumer's	1
25733	4334	I'm going to be honest here, most people like to read	2
25734	4334	I know I sometimes read to study and if they got rid of the books that I read to study	3
25735	4334	How would I study	4
25736	4334	Even teachers go to the library to study or to even get books, or maybe get books for there grand kids or there kids	5
25737	4334	Parents do the samething	6
25738	4334	People don't understand that music helps everybody some point in time	7
25739	4334	I know people who listen to music to help them consentriate on different things like homework, regular work, or even being stressed out	8
25740	4334	There are alot of different ways that music helps alot of people	9
25741	4334	If people decided to feel offensive over stuff like that then something is wrong with them because after all these years there have been no complaints	10
25742	4334	Honestly i have never got movies or magazine's from the lilbrary before	11
25743	4334	People do it for there kids or grand kids, I don't really see the big deal	12
25744	4334	Its not like they are watching anything bad	13
25745	4334	They mostly have kid movies not bad ones	14
25746	4334	Why would people want to take little thing like that from little kids	15
25747	4334	In a way that makes me mad because I like little kids they don't hurt anybody.	16
25748	4337	Censoring @CAPS1     We all know that language is the foundation of human legacy	0
25749	4337	Language is spoken to mean anything the speaker is trying to communicate	1
25750	4337	To take books from the shelves is to steal the words from the mouths of many great speakers	2
25751	4337	We have the obligation to keep the @CAPS1 that we have created alive	3
25752	4337	If something is forgotten, it is as if nothing happened	4
25753	4337	If nothing happened, it will reoccur- good or bad	5
25754	4337	To hide away words from our children is wrong	6
25755	4337	If not by word of print, word of mouth will lead them to the same discoveries as they would have come to if reading it from a book	7
25756	4337	But even more importantly, what good is hiding the truth	8
25757	4337	When many speak of tragic incidences, they speak, '@CAPS2 forget.'  If we should not forget, why should the youth @CAPS2 learn	9
25758	4337	There is nothing in print that can not be conveyed in a different communication form	10
25759	4337	Our @CAPS1 is written on the pages of literature	11
25760	4337	The books we read are the property of all humanity and should be read by all to educate us of our mistakes as well as our triumphs	12
25761	4337	A commonly debated topic in the world of censorship is 'The @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 @CAPS5.'  @CAPS6 is a novel that displays what life was truly like in one of @LOCATION1's most racially barbaric times	13
25762	4337	One might argue the fact that it uses an offensive 'n' word more than a few times	14
25763	4337	To @CAPS6 one might argue that @PERSON3, the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 that stood by @PERSON2 was loved by @PERSON2	15
25764	4337	A book in @CAPS6 time displaying a friendship between a black and a white man is truly a ground breaking feat	16
25765	4337	The 'n' word was common place in @CAPS6 time period- a friendship between a black man and a white man was not	17
25766	4337	Is it really important that a child knows of just another offensive word that they are bound to discover eventually anyway, or is it more important that they learn that color of skin does not change a person	18
25767	4337	Do not take the opportunity for a child to learn what really matters away	19
25768	4337	To take one book away is to take all of them away	20
25769	4337	Censoring one piece of literature opens the doors of debate for every other piece ever created	21
25770	4337	The world has seen what can happen when things get censored	22
25771	4337	During @PERSON1's dictatorship, nearly everything from the internet, to books, to newspwpers, to television programming, to movies, to music, to magazines were censored so only what the dictatorship wanted got through	23
25772	4337	The people were brainwashed, and those who were not rose up, and when they did they were shot down	24
25773	4337	Do not let the world come to that	25
25774	4337	We are better than that and our literature shows it	26
25775	4337	In other words, to censor media and the literature that surrounds us, we deprive ourselves of education and freedoms that are critical to the well being of future generations	27
25776	4337	Do not hide the free speech of authors, do not hide our @CAPS1 from our children, do not let us make the same mistake that has been made before	28
25777	4337	Let us educate our children for the future of humanity	29
25778	4337	Let our @CAPS1 not repeat itself	30
25779	4337	Let us innovate and create a new, better world	31
25780	4337	Let us allow our words to flow freely	32
25781	4337	Let us allow our legacy to live on.	33
25782	4338	The Author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
25783	4338	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does anyone else	1
25784	4338	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I do believe certain materials, such as music, books, and movies shouldn't be on a  childrens shelf  to read, but rather on an adult shelf 	2
25785	4338	I believe every author has his or her right to express ones self and to be accepted for that	3
25786	4338	We all have our own beliefs and standards that we would like others to respect even if we dont agree on there beliefs	4
25787	4338	If  every book that was found offensive was taken of  a shelf we would soon have no books left	5
25788	4338	The reason for that is because everyone finds certain thing offensive	6
25789	4338	Many children are intersted in certain thing and we cant hold them back from that unless it is inappropriate or goes againts family morals or valus such a religous beliefs	7
25790	4338	It would be a good thing to monater what your children are reading, wacthing and listening to	8
25791	4338	On the other hand adult shelfs will have many diffrent things that would be offensive to many diffrent people unlike childrens books	9
25792	4338	Writing is a way to show a persons expressions and what they stand for although it @MONTH1 not be pleasing to me or any other person	10
25793	4338	But what if we write a book and sombody does not like it then we wouldnt like it if they took it off the shelf	11
25794	4338	that would show direpect to a person who has thought long and hard on there work	12
25795	4338	Learn to stand proud on what you believe	13
25796	4338	Learn also to respect others as well and to let children be around safe family type of books, music and magazines	14
25797	4340	Censorship for the future kids of america	0
25798	4340	Personally i have read some disturbing books also watched some grotesque and twisted, disturbing rated @CAPS1 movies	1
25799	4340	Not even talking about all the messed up music ive heard so far in my lifetime	2
25800	4340	What it comes down to is alot of the music today is about sex, drugs, money, and violent crimes and gangs	3
25801	4340	The movies have a rating system which helps out for little kids	4
25802	4340	Books any one can get from a public library and some are about murder, rape, gang, violence, and all the horrable reality of the devilsh deeds in the world	5
25803	4340	I personally dont have a kid but if i had a kid and he read a book that was bad or heard a dirty song with some of those lyrics and if he watched a rated @CAPS1 movie i would wanna file a complaint because thats not how i want my kid growing up	6
25804	4340	With a twisted mind and a vocabulary of a little punk with curse words every ten seconds coming out his mouth	7
25805	4340	Also i would'nt want my kid kissing his mom with that kind of stuff coming out his mouth	8
25806	4340	But the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to keep all that stuff away from kids until there old enough to go get it on there own like they need to be @NUM1 to go see a rated @CAPS1 movie	9
25807	4340	That is how it should have always been.	10
25808	4341	'' I feel that materials, such as book,music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
25809	4341	Some @CAPS1 like offensive things that they have in the library	1
25810	4341	Some @CAPS1 would sometimes want to know about certain things that is offensive.Most @CAPS1 could be offensive to alot of different things.Different @CAPS1 have different things that are offensive.What might be offensive to you probably not offensive to me.''     @CAPS1 that dont like offensive things just shouldnt check it out and @CAPS1 that like offensive things jus could check it out.I feel that they just shouldnt be removed just because @CAPS1 dont like offensive things they just shouldnt check it out.You just cant removed things that are offensive just because some @CAPS1 dont like offensive things	2
25811	4341	Everyone do have their own right but some @CAPS1 like offended things	3
25812	4341	I read a book that was offended to me, but it told me how to react to the situation and how to overcome my situation	4
25813	4341	So some things @MONTH1 offend you, but some things you just have to read about it more because some things tell you how to overcome that situation or it will tell you what to do about the situation you had been offended by.Thats why I feel that you shouldnt remove offensive books.	5
25814	4342	Moving @CAPS1 The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 In @CAPS4	0
25815	4342	When you enter a library or a book store of course you will find @CAPS3 that you like and dislike	1
25816	4342	You're opinion @MONTH1 not be the same as someone else	2
25817	4342	Sometime you can feel a little bit uncomfortable with the situation and the way thing are going	3
25818	4342	People have diffrernt looks about different @CAPS3 in this way of @CAPS4	4
25819	4342	You are going to come across good @CAPS3, bad thing, happy @CAPS3, sad @CAPS3, @CAPS3 you agree about, and @CAPS3 you disagree about	5
25820	4342	I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else should not be removed if they are found offensive to anybody	6
25821	4342	The reason I state that is because if any of those items offened one person they might not be offensive to another	7
25822	4342	Different people have different intrest in many different @CAPS3	8
25823	4342	So therefore it should not be any reason that the materials should be removed from the shelves	9
25824	4342	Especially if they are not hurting anything or anyone physically	10
25825	4342	Speaking from personal experience there were many times i felt offened about certain @CAPS3	11
25826	4342	I feel that abortions can come off a bit harmful to a @CAPS4 that has not been born yet	12
25827	4342	Killing a child that has not experince the thing you have is not right	13
25828	4342	But some sometime the way i can feel can be alot different to other people	14
25829	4342	So who am I to tell another person what they can and can not do	15
25830	4342	That comes with voicing your own opinion	16
25831	4342	You can not change the way another person is thinking or feeling	17
25832	4342	If you find a book or anything like that hard to deal with it is crazy	18
25833	4342	Think about the @CAPS2 situation that you might come across and can be offensive to you	19
25834	4342	It will be alot of times you will disagree or have an opinion but can not change or do anything about it	20
25835	4342	@CAPS3 will be much easier and less @CAPS2 if we sometimes deal with the difficullt @CAPS3 in @CAPS4	21
25836	4344	In many @CAPS1 libraries across the nation, a numerous amount of: books, magazines, movies and music aren't provided because they are found offensive	0
25837	4344	I do not believe this should happen because everybody is unique and @MONTH1 find different types of work offensive	1
25838	4344	Who is it that chooses these items to be taken out of libraries and why should they be the only ones to say what goes and what stays	2
25839	4344	Everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions	3
25840	4344	Some people are athletic, gothic, preppy and nerdy	4
25841	4344	The library is open to anybody that wishes to enter	5
25842	4344	What happens if the people that choose what content is provided in the library, doesn't like scary books, so they take all of the scary books out	6
25843	4344	What if their is a person that only reads scary books	7
25844	4344	What then will they have to read	8
25845	4344	I bet if that person had the ability to choose what stays and what goes in the library, they would only have horror in the library	9
25846	4344	I do not believe that anybody should have the right to censor what content is provided in @CAPS1 libraries	10
25847	4344	Everyone has their own opinion and interests so they should have everything open in libraries	11
25848	4344	There is a reason that @CAPS1 libraries are called @CAPS1	12
25849	4344	That means that it is open to anyone and everyone	13
25850	4344	There should be all kinds of different genres to read and all sorts of movies to choose from	14
25851	4344	Just because one person doesn't like a certain kind of genre, or doesn't find it appropriate for a certain viewing audience, does not mean that they can take it out of a @CAPS1 library	15
25852	4344	That would be why there is such thing as sections in libraries	16
25853	4344	If you don't find a certain type of book appropriate, place it in the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' section of your library	17
25854	4344	For example: @PERSON1, he is a very popular author to many different viewing audiences	18
25855	4344	His ideas are very different than most	19
25856	4344	He writes horror but displays gore and a lot of sexual content in his writing	20
25857	4344	It is his own writing style	21
25858	4344	If the people that choose what is in the libraries, don't find that appropriate or if they find it offensive, they should put it in the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' sections or even the '@CAPS3' section	22
25859	4344	It should be up to the childrens' parents what their kid is reading	23
25860	4344	not the library itself	24
25861	4344	I do not believe that anyone should choose what is and isn't provided in libraries	25
25862	4344	Everybody is unique, different and have their own opinions on different things and ideas	26
25863	4344	If you remove a specific type of book, movie, magazine or music from a library, and it's the only kind a certain person reads, what then will they have to read	27
25864	4344	What if somebody took out the kind that only you like to read	28
25865	4344	What then will you do	29
25866	4344	If everybody had the choice and right to do this, I don't think that anything will be left in libraries	30
25867	4344	All genres of everything should be available to the @CAPS1	31
25868	4344	If you don't find a book appropriate, place it in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 section of your library to still have it open to anybody	32
25869	4344	That would just be a big @CAPS9 to anybody who decides to pick it up and read it	33
25870	4344	You need to think of everybody, not just yourself.	34
25871	4345	Should books, magazines ect..	0
25872	4345	really be censored, taken off a shelf in a library, just because you might find them offensive	1
25873	4345	Some of you who are reading this would say yes, but why	2
25874	4345	What would be the reason behind it	3
25875	4345	So to answer the first question I asked, my answer would have to be no, because a library is a public place for all ages, and each area is labeled or should be labeled the genre of book, magazine, ect.	4
25876	4345	it is	5
25877	4345	I myself read almost just about everything I can get my hands on, and for some people its the same way	6
25878	4345	Yes, I understand that if it is offensive to you that you probably would feel they should censor it, but what about those that it isn't offensive to	7
25879	4345	What would you say to them	8
25880	4345	How would you explain why it was offensive	9
25881	4345	Most of all how would you react if they held it against you	10
25882	4345	If it was because of one person or a small group of people that one of my favorite books or series was censored, in all honesty I would be pretty ticked	11
25883	4345	Books are for everyone to read, they shouldn't not be able to read the books they love because they have been taken off the shelf	12
25884	4345	I think that if a person really doesn't like the book and finds it offensive should then just ignore it, and move on to find another book, they shouldn't have looked at it in the first place	13
25885	4345	Books will be offensive to some one some how, usually a book is written to target a certain group of people, for instance what if someone found the romance novels a lot of people love, offensive	14
25886	4345	What if that was all the person read	15
25887	4345	Well, the people who only read romance novels wouldn't have a book to read because, someone had them censored and taken off the shelves	16
25888	4345	Books have been written, to help teach, get away from the real world, create a place to go for a person with an imagination, give someone hope, mystery, excitement	17
25889	4345	Books aren't something that should be taken off a library shelf, they are a bit of something for some one who just loves to read	18
25890	4345	Yes, there would be books you don't want your kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews to read, but that can't be helped, you can't censor every book that you don't want them to read or find offensive for them	19
25891	4345	If you did there wouldn't be a single book on a library shelf	20
25892	4345	So for those of you who have read this, think about it, when you pick up a book and find it offensive do you want to make someone else upset because you had it taken off the shelf	21
25893	4345	You never know when that might happen to you, think about it before you go and tried to do that to a book.	22
25894	4346	I don't believe that any certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc	0
25895	4346	Should be removed from the libraries shelves, because any thing can be offensive	1
25896	4346	What if someone needed to resourch about the @NUM1	2
25897	4346	Well they really won't be able to, if all the books about @NUM1 were taken off the shelves, only bacause someone found it offensive	3
25898	4346	Now days, everything is offensive to somebody	4
25899	4346	For this, people need to understand that it is what it is, and if you were not appart of that problem, then what do you need to worry about	5
25900	4346	This day and age is evil all around the world	6
25901	4346	There are going to be things happening that are going to make people feel a little offensive	7
25902	4346	Just like all the earthquakes around the world, I know that there is some people offensive about that, but what if somebody was in college, and they wanted to learn more about what happened, so maybe they can get a group of people, and make there lives better	8
25903	4346	People are hurting and I understand that, but us people are not here to judge, we are here to help the poor, and the sick, get by with what they have, and just help them see that there is a way out	9
25904	4346	With all this said I don't believe that we should remove the books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves in libraries.	10
25905	4347	When i go to the library, most of the time, I'm doing research on a specific topic	0
25906	4347	The information I want, is the facts that really happened, or took place	1
25907	4347	This would not be possible if they censored all the material the offended somebody	2
25908	4347	Leaving libraries uncensored gives us the full effect of what we're reading, or researching	3
25909	4347	It is important for readers and researches, to connect and take in all the information they read	4
25910	4347	That is what keeps us interested in what we are doing	5
25911	4347	Authors write the things they write, for a reason	6
25912	4347	Taking there hard work off the shelves, because some little thing offends someone, is not fair to them	7
25913	4347	Besides, either way, someone is getting offended, because the auther is goin to get offended, for taking his hard work off the shelves	8
25914	4347	As you @MONTH1 tell, i am against censoring our libraries	9
25915	4347	The way i see it, is that if something offends you, then dont look at it	10
25916	4348	I disagree with library censorship	0
25917	4348	Every person should be allowed to produce their reflection of their believes or ideas	1
25918	4348	If certian books found offensive were to be removed from libraries then there would be nothing left for anyone to read	2
25919	4348	If parents are concerned with what their children are checking out from the library to read then they should read it before their child to see if they think it is appropriate	3
25920	4348	In my opinion children should be able to read what ever they like and by doing that they can teach themselves many things	4
25921	4348	Books can also help children to escape from every day life.Admitedly, children should not always escape, or use reading to hide from real life, but occasionaly they need too	5
25922	4348	I know as a young child when things were not going so well I could always turn to reading to get my mind off of the bad things	6
25923	4348	If children are allowed these escapes they can do better on their school work and with their peers	7
25924	4348	Reading can help a child to expand their imaginations	8
25925	4348	If a child reads a couple times a day it is proven that said child will do better in life	9
25926	4348	No one likes boring people, and how can you be boring with such a wide imagination	10
25927	4348	It is impossible	11
25928	4348	In recent online polls, parents who's children can access books say that their children to better in school and in every day life	12
25929	4348	By reading, these children can easily expand their vocabularies	13
25930	4348	With this knowlege they can learn with less difficulty and can excell in acedemics with ease	14
25931	4348	In conclusion, If certian books are censored from the libraries they will be inavailable for children to read	15
25932	4348	Children need books to provide an escape, to expand their imaginations, and to help them in school and life	16
25933	4348	Do not let libraries censor books!	17
25934	4349	Some materials in libraries @MONTH1 have information that is offensive towards others	0
25935	4349	But should they be removed if they are found offensive	1
25936	4349	Some people believe that they should be removed depending on how bad the offense is	2
25937	4349	But materials @MONTH1 be removed if it is sexual, racist, or life threatening offense	3
25938	4349	Some material @MONTH1 have offensive comments that is sexual	4
25939	4349	If its an offense that is sensored and the author or artist of the material went too far, then that @MONTH1 be a good reason for the material to be removed	5
25940	4349	It @MONTH1 make the person feel emotions that bring them down	6
25941	4349	It @MONTH1 also make the person feel violated and offended	7
25942	4349	There @MONTH1 be material that has racist comments	8
25943	4349	Racism is one of the biggest conflicts in the world today	9
25944	4349	It is something that starts fights and arguements	10
25945	4349	It also causes individuals to feel bad about themselves	11
25946	4349	Racism can cause people to feel very hurt also	12
25947	4349	So if there is too much racism in a material, then that should be removed	13
25948	4349	There are some material that @MONTH1 have offense that seems life threatening	14
25949	4349	Say that it is a book about the whole nation and the author slips in something that @MONTH1 seem like the nation would be in danger, someone @MONTH1 feel offended and want that material removed	15
25950	4349	Material with too much threat in it @MONTH1 make one feel like their life is in danger or like something bad is going to happen	16
25951	4349	They would feel a life threatening offense and want it to be removed from the shelves	17
25952	4349	So should offensive materials be removed from the shelves	18
25953	4349	Yes they should	19
25954	4349	If they were to be found sexually, life threatening offense or had racist comments, they should be removed so individuals won't feel these offenses are life threatening, hurtful, or cause negative emotions	20
25955	4350	Taking 'offensive' books from the shelves of libraries is like taking away the right of speech	0
25956	4350	There is not a point to it	1
25957	4350	People in this country have the right of speech	2
25958	4350	Along with that comes the right to have your voice be heard	3
25959	4350	An author's opinions @MONTH1 be offensive to some but does that mean he or she should not have a voice	4
25960	4350	Writers get their ideas from somewhere society plays a huge role in what ideas these authors conjer up, taking these books away will not change the way people think and feel, and most importantly citizens of the @LOCATION1 have the right to make their own choices	5
25961	4350	that being if you don't like a book don't check it out	6
25962	4350	Writers @MONTH1 state things that to some degree @MONTH1 offend one in a million people	7
25963	4350	Others see it as freedom of speech and writing	8
25964	4350	An author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second graders	9
25965	4350	But if a person has a problem with the way the author sees the world walking out their front door will show that same thing	10
25966	4350	Some books @MONTH1 be fictional but that does not mean they don't get ideas from somewhere else	11
25967	4350	Society plays a big part in the ideas and thoughts of most writers	12
25968	4350	So when they write a book that has 'inappropriate' actions in it they got it from the way people truly are in the world	13
25969	4350	Banning a book from the library that has a sex scene or provacitive language does not --by any means-- make the world stop having sex and saying curse words	14
25970	4350	Kids are learning this through hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talking about sex	15
25971	4350	Reading a book about it will not change the fact that they are still learning about it in many other ways	16
25972	4350	If the books that swear were no longer on library shelves society still will not change	17
25973	4350	There is no perfect society	18
25974	4350	Setting a book on a shelf with offensive language does not cause harm to anyone	19
25975	4350	If an idividual doesn't like the way an author expresses themselves through their writing that person should not check that author's books out from the library	20
25976	4350	No single person is forced to read a book they are offended by	21
25977	4350	Getting rid of a book because of an unhappy parent does nothing but waste paper and intelligence	22
25978	4350	The library is not liable for the feelings of the readers	23
25979	4350	If the reader does not like the book they are able to close it	24
25980	4350	No one has glued their fingers to it	25
25981	4350	Many people in today's world would agree that banning books from our public libraries will not have as much of an effect as some would like it to	26
25982	4350	Banning books is an unknowledgeable thing to do to keep your kids from learning bad things	27
25983	4350	Society shows that the writers are getting their ideas from somewhere, taking these books away will not take away the way people think and behave, and if some one does not like a book they should not read it	28
25984	4351	One could understand why some would wish to censor libraries and remove all rude, unwanted, or offensive forms of media from thier shelves	0
25985	4351	However, one must take into account that, as Katherine Paterson said, if one person has 'the right to remove that [a] book from the shelf...then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.'       With that thought in mind, do we honestly think that censorship of libraries is a smart idea	1
25986	4351	If everyone was able to pick and choose which books to be taken off the shelf or which music to ban, then we would have nothing left	2
25987	4351	You simply cannot please everyone	3
25988	4351	Are there benefits	4
25989	4351	Of course there are benefits	5
25990	4351	One certainly wouldn't want one's child exposed to certain material at a young age	6
25991	4351	But one must not censor libraries	7
25992	4351	If one wishes, as a responsible parent, that their child keep away from a particular book or movie, they should take that matter into their own hands and not condemn the book off the shelf	8
25993	4351	By condemning the book, one condemns the author	9
25994	4351	As an @CAPS1, one has the freedom of speech, and this applies to media as well	10
25995	4351	The author has the right to author a book that some @MONTH1 view as offensive, and no one has the right to remove his or her right from the standing	11
25996	4351	Paper burns at @NUM1 degrees @CAPS2	12
25997	4351	In the classic novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, the protagonist struggles through life in a world antagonized by the banning and burning of books	13
25998	4351	The story takes place in the future, however, it contains an interesting undertone that hints at the possiblity that this 'future' @MONTH1 be nearer than first imagined	14
25999	4351	To be blunt, the protagonist's life is horrible, he lives in a world that bans books, yet he is quite the bibliophile	15
26000	4351	He is employed as a fireman, not to clear fires, but to create them	16
26001	4351	@PERSON2's firemen are responsible for the delicate task of book burning, which is a rather frequent occurance	17
26002	4351	However, with the main character's love for literature, how can he burn books	18
26003	4351	Throughout the novel, the character tries to come to terms with himself and attempts to put an end to the madness, only to be forced out of civilized society	19
26004	4351	The book is freightening, but an amazing read: it emphasizes the dire reality of censorship	20
26005	4351	It's everywhere	21
26006	4351	Now, one certainly doesn't need to worry about @PERSON2's futuristic hell, coming to life any time soon	22
26007	4351	But one should know the dangers of censorship	23
26008	4351	No one person has the right to remove a book from the shelves that they feel is offensive, let alone ban it entirely	24
26009	4351	The banning of books, is a banning of freedom	25
26010	4351	Freedom of speech, freedom of ideas, freedom of thought	26
26011	4351	Another disutopian world that comes to mind is the world of @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE1	27
26012	4351	Though, granted, our society is certainly not headed for that any time soon, if ever: it is still a valid point	28
26013	4351	Once some freedoms are removed, others will follow	29
26014	4351	Libraries should remain entirely intact, forever	30
26015	4351	Every person, every man, woman and child should have ample access to knowlede	31
26016	4351	Whether this knowledge be gained through books, magazines, movies or music, it needs to be readily avaliable	32
26017	4351	Instead of banning certain media, one should label said media with a warning	33
26018	4351	Parents should have enough sense to pay attention and thus, the problem is solved	34
26019	4351	Censorship is wrong, censorship is unnessesary, and there are a plethora of alternative means for protection against pottentially 'offensive' media	35
26020	4351	Thus, the case can rest with the knowledge that all forms of media need to availiable, no matter what the content	36
26021	4352	There are many books out there that parents would not want there children reading	0
26022	4352	Some books have violence and crimes, others have love and romance	1
26023	4352	But it is not the best idea to use censorship in libraries	2
26024	4352	There are many books out there that might not be good for children to read, but it might help them make better choices in real life	3
26025	4352	Also, we can not forget about freedom of the press	4
26026	4352	With freedom of the press anyone can write about anything they want	5
26027	4352	They can write about the good, the bad, violence, crimes, love, and romance	6
26028	4352	Everyone has there own way of writing and there own imagination	7
26029	4352	Without imagination what fiction would there be for children to read	8
26030	4352	There would be nothing to write about without imagination	9
26031	4352	With censorship, there would not be any books on the library shelves for children to read	10
26032	4352	If the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves there would not be any books to read because every book has something to censor	11
26033	4352	Wethear it is swearing, guns, killing, romance, or love	12
26034	4352	There is something in every book that in innapproperate for children to read	13
26035	4352	If the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves there would nothing left to read, and the intelligence of children would drop dramatically	14
26036	4352	Children read for many reasons, like to expand there minds and to enter a world where the book takes place	15
26037	4352	But what children might not know is that reading also strengthens there vocabulary	16
26038	4352	When children read they learn many new words that are in that book	17
26039	4352	While they are reading the book opens there mind to much more then what they are used to and normally around everyday	18
26040	4352	When they are reading the children expand the minds and also helps them with everyday situations	19
26041	4352	This is why I do not believe that censorship in libraries is not a great idea	20
26042	4352	If libraries censorship books and everything else on the shelves there would be nothing left for children at the libraries	21
26043	4352	They would be stuck reading books where they do not learn anything	22
26044	4352	They would read the same books over and over, they wouldnt learn anything new	23
26045	4352	There wouldnt be anything the could expand there minds with	24
26046	4352	That is something we certinly do not want for our community or anywhere for that matter	25
26047	4354	Have you ever picked up a piece of material while in a library and it offended you	0
26048	4354	Would you want your children reading, watching, or hearing stuff that was offensive towards them	1
26049	4354	I don't think no parent wants that	2
26050	4354	Think about it, how do children have access to things like that	3
26051	4354	Is it all around or do children go and find it	4
26052	4354	Not every single child in @LOCATION1 is going to be protected from bad materials	5
26053	4354	Most of the time after school, children stay in the house and do stuff instead of going outside	6
26054	4354	Inside of their house they have access to televison, computers, and music	7
26055	4354	They think why go outside when I have all this stuff inside	8
26056	4354	Truth be told children hear so much harmful things from everywhere and anywhere	9
26057	4354	Nothing is censored like it was back in the day	10
26058	4354	Now a days nobody cares if materials are offensive, just as long as they sell	11
26059	4354	That's not the way it suppose to be at all, everybody should want best for the children and young teens	12
26060	4354	People wonder why their is violence, bad attitudes, crimes, etc., because all the stuff we have access to	13
26061	4354	Schools could help prevent this probelm by removing offensive materials off the shelves in the libraries	14
26062	4354	It's sad that type of material is available in a school, but thats how the generation is today	15
26063	4354	In a library only certain things should be done	16
26064	4354	Reading, using computers, working at a table	17
26065	4354	Children shouldn't be able to get on a computer and play games, or listen to music with bad words in it, or prehaps pick up a dirty magazine	18
26066	4354	Library should be a place for learning, doing work, and reading	19
26067	4354	If their is less offensive materials in a school enviorment that's one step into fixing this problem	20
26068	4354	Censorship is much needed everywhere, it would help out a lot	21
26069	4355	The common phrase 'knowledge is power' accurately paints the situation at hand	0
26070	4355	Through censorship in libraries, which are meant to allow free access to all media-related materials, we take away the opportunity for people to empower themselves through knowledge	1
26071	4355	The reasons for not censoring media in libraries are numerous and include, but are not limited to, unconstitutionality of censorship, the lack of proper definition for 'offensive', and the contradiction censorship poses to the core of what a library is	2
26072	4355	The first, and most blatant, reason for not allowing the censorship of materials in libraries is the unconstitutionality of the matter	3
26073	4355	Freedom of speech and freedom of press are both protected by the constitution upon which our country was founded	4
26074	4355	Censorship of said materials will effectively undermine both of these rights	5
26075	4355	Authors, illustrators, journalists and the slew of other individuals who compose the materials available in libraries are exercising their right to free speech through their works	6
26076	4355	They are constitutionally protected in the things they say	7
26077	4355	Notice that @CAPS1 have a right to free speech and not a right to free speech so long as no one is offended	8
26078	4355	The freedom of press is the means by which they share their ideas and concepts with the world	9
26079	4355	They are utilizing their free speech by means of press	10
26080	4355	Censoring library materials would be limiting the means by which artists can share their ideas with citizens of the @LOCATION1	11
26081	4355	This would be a clear failure to uphold the rights of the citizens	12
26082	4355	For this reason, we cannot censor libraries	13
26083	4355	The constitutional concept of equality of man plays into the situation as well	14
26084	4355	There is no adequate legal definition of 'offend'	15
26085	4355	People could be offended by something as serious as a personal attack on their beliefs and personal entity or something as light as a personal distaste for certain mindsets and ideas	16
26086	4355	So, because all men are equal, we would have to respect the 'offense' taken by all people and to all degrees	17
26087	4355	This leaves every single work of art, whether it be a book, movie, magazine or any other form provided by libraries, open to the fickle definition of offensive and vulnerable to the personal feelings of every individual	18
26088	4355	If said offense taken by individuals to works is able to mark a work as 'offensive' and thus make it open to removal from libraries, we are effectively allowing citizens to undermine the rights of other citizens	19
26089	4355	This is something that cannot be allowed in our libraries	20
26090	4355	The final core issue is the essence of censorship versus the essence of a library	21
26091	4355	Censorship is meant to create a politically correct and non-offensive environment through the limitation of exposure to materials	22
26092	4355	Libraries, however, are meant to allow public access to works that stretch and challenge knowledge, beliefs, notions and all ideas held by people through the works of others	23
26093	4355	Censorship cannot be implemented without a clash with the essence of a library's purpose	24
26094	4355	If censorship were to be enacted, a library could not provide new information if someone else did not like what was being taught	25
26095	4355	A library could not provide works that challenge and stretch individual beliefs if someone was offended by the means by which the stretching occurred	26
26096	4355	Pre-conceived notions could not be defeated with the presence of factual knowledge if someone did not like the truth	27
26097	4355	In all of these ways, and many more, a library's core ideals and purpose could not be upheld with the induction of a system of censorship	28
26098	4355	All in all, we can see that censorship could only hope to destroy the system libraries abide by	29
26099	4355	The constitutional rights of citizens would be infringed upon, the fickle nature of humans and the lack of definition for 'offensive' would allow people to undermine the rights of others, and the essence of what a library really is would be ravaged	30
26100	4355	We cannot, as @CAPS1 with rights, employ a system of censorship	31
26101	4357	I don't think that certain materials in books, music, movies, and  magazines should be removed from shelves because I think that everyone has the right to say what they want to say, but I do think some things in books, movies, and music that might be appropriate for a high school student aren't appropriate for an elementary school student	0
26102	4357	Some things can be really offensive to elementary school students but not so much to high school students, it would just depend on what they are reading, watching, and hearing	1
26103	4357	I've never experienced anything offensive in what i've read in any book before but I have experienced some in music i've heard	2
26104	4357	I didn't say really anything about it I just thought someone shouldn't have written this certain song that I was listening to and I didn't think it would really be that bad	3
26105	4357	It's mostly in rap music that i've heard that's really offensive and I think shouldn't have been even written	4
26106	4357	But I still think everyone has a right to say what it is that they are wanting to say	5
26107	4358	We all have our favorite books and some we like others @MONTH1 not	0
26108	4358	Have you ever walked into the library in hope of finding your all time favorite book that you nearly forgot about, or maby a book a friend recomended to you	1
26109	4358	What happens when you get there and the book has been censored	2
26110	4358	Most books we see in our public or school libraries are are bookes that are well liked or are favorites of many	3
26111	4358	Books open a new world to everyone and should not be taken away	4
26112	4358	To begin, I will explain some problems in our libraries	5
26113	4358	Some people believe the books and magazines in our libraries should be censored and removed from the shelves because it could be offensive to some people because of racial shurs or comments	6
26114	4358	This is a big problem because most books written years ago took place long ago like @PERSON1 for example, @MONTH1 be considered offensive but, this book gives a glimpse of what was going on in this time period and without it some people would never know what happened and we couldn't learn from those mistakes and make better choices in the future	7
26115	4358	Some books that are censored have great educational value	8
26116	4358	Everyone has there prefrence on books and what some say should be taken away because of what they think others @MONTH1 not	9
26117	4358	If all books that are bad or offencive were taken off the shelves then eventually we would have no books left	10
26118	4358	We have the right to read any book out there no matter how horrendus it @MONTH1 be, besides you can go to church and read worse things that are being censored out of our libraries	11
26119	4358	If we couldn't read some books like many classics it would take educational value away from us all	12
26120	4358	Think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored	13
26121	4358	Before someone gets into a book they should read the informational part on the back to see what it is about before they start to read something not suited for them	14
26122	4358	I believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it	15
26123	4358	Being censored is not protecting anyone it only makes things worse	16
26124	4358	If someone feels offended then they shouldn't read it, it's their choice to pick it up or not	17
26125	4358	Hopefully I have persuaded you that no book should be censored and everyone has the right to read what they want	18
26126	4359	Killings, murders, and homosexual books can all be offensive to one person or another, but that doesn't mean they should be taken away	0
26127	4359	That is like saying I get offened by homework, take it out of @ORGANIZATION2	1
26128	4359	Some of the most interesting books to read are about murders, I think	2
26129	4359	I belive they shouldn't be taken out or else no teenage kids would read in @ORGANIZATION1	3
26130	4359	Teenages like to have mystery and romance	4
26131	4359	I know that one of my favorite books, The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, would offend some people because it has murder in it	5
26132	4359	That certainly doesn't mean it was not a good and interesting book for me	6
26133	4359	They can just over look these books and pick another	7
26134	4359	If you want to keep your @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 students interested you shouldn't take out book that might offend someone	8
26135	4359	By taking out some books not everyone would be happy	9
26136	4359	Some kids might not even read any more because you took the best books out of the library	10
26137	4359	Every book in one way or another would offend someone	11
26138	4359	They just need to overlook those books and read a diffrent one	12
26139	4359	I have seen some books at my @ORGANIZATION2 that offended me, but i did not tell the libraian to take it out of the @ORGANIZATION2	13
26140	4359	Another student might have loved to read that book	14
26141	4359	Everyone has diffrent oppions so there would not be any books left if they took out all the offensive ones	15
26142	4359	The only books that would be left would be @PERSON1 the @CAPS3 and children books	16
26143	4359	I do not know of any @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 student that would want to read @PERSON1 the @CAPS3 and give a speech about it in class	17
26144	4359	I'm not sure how the teachers could do book reports any more	18
26145	4359	all the books we read in class could offend someone	19
26146	4359	If everything that offened someone was taken out of the schoolt there would be nothing left of the @ORGANIZATION2	20
26147	4359	See everyone has a diffrent oppion on everything	21
26148	4359	That just isn't right	22
26149	4359	In conclusion, books that offend someone shouldn't be taken out of schools and librarys	23
26150	4359	They keep the @ORGANIZATION2 students reading and growing	24
26151	4359	With out some of these books I myself wouln't like reading	25
26152	4359	So lets be mature aldults and keep all the books on the shelves and ignore the books that offend us	26
26153	4360	Censoring any type of media such as books, magazines, movies, or music from a library is not right	0
26154	4360	A library is huge amount information put common places for people to seek out knowledge.When something is found offensive, you should not hide it a away as though it was never there	1
26155	4360	If any media is offensive, it should be the person who is looking up the information to choose if he/she wants to use it.When someone for example a child has something offensive, the first thought is to take it away from the library or television.Instead, just explain what it is there looking at and they will eventually understand the reason it is offensive, but how does someone know what is offensive or not?Just because something is found offensive by one or two people does not make it right to just take it away	2
26156	4360	It should be talked about or discused by groups of people on the subject then decided whether or not it should be taken off the shelves for being offensive.If there is a book or magazine on the shelve and it might be offensive it should a decision made by the people surrounding that type information to take it off the shelve and not to be hidden away.	3
26157	4361	Are offensive materials offensive to everybody	0
26158	4361	Does everyone think the same material is offensive	1
26159	4361	Who is to say what is or is not offensive	2
26160	4361	Offensive material can be anything someone wants to think of	3
26161	4361	Children are going to see this material anyways, weither we take it away of not	4
26162	4361	Offensive material, such as cursing or rage, is a form of expression and of releaving stress	5
26163	4361	Such things can also show anger, hate, and depression	6
26164	4361	Children will see and hear offensive things anyways	7
26165	4361	Even as it is now, parents try to hid such things from their children	8
26166	4361	this makes them curious	9
26167	4361	They will do anything to understand it	10
26168	4361	Offensive things are part of everyday life	11
26169	4361	The more you hid it, the more children will seek it out	12
26170	4361	In movies, books, and music, this is a form of expression	13
26171	4361	it releaves stress, rage, and shows this so that @CAPS1 is a true picture of what is going on	14
26172	4361	People cannot imagion someone truly angery in a book when it says, '..	15
26173	4361	and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong	16
26174	4361	You don't know what you have done!'...' You cannot show foreshadowing, or show the anger	17
26175	4361	You cannot see how a character truly feels	18
26176	4361	For example, '..	19
26177	4361	and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong	20
26178	4361	You will parish	21
26179	4361	You don't know what you have done	22
26180	4361	Death will come!'...' @CAPS1, you have an idea of how the author will play out the story and how the character really feels	23
26181	4361	You can see the foreshadowing	24
26182	4361	The author could be saying that a good man has died, who was going to stop evil, or an evil man died, and people will revenge him	25
26183	4361	In such ways, this can show anger	26
26184	4361	Some people would find the example offensive or out of line	27
26185	4361	Cursing to me is not offensive	28
26186	4361	But, they show how the character, writer, or singer feels when it was written without it having to state it	29
26187	4361	Offensive material can also grief	30
26188	4361	This shows that someone is hurt by what has happened, amplifying the story	31
26189	4361	allowing the reader, watcher, or listener to expect more and want more	32
26190	4361	So the reader, watcher or listener would wait for more, and by the music, book, or movie	33
26191	4361	It puts intrest into the material	34
26192	4361	Only certain people can agree on something offensive	35
26193	4361	Such as family, friends, or a group of close people	36
26194	4361	But, it applies foreshadowing, intrest, anger, grief, and sometimes, passion	37
26195	4361	Your children will see it if they truly want to	38
26196	4361	So, why get rid of something that they will see anyways	39
26197	4361	Something that intersts them and makes them want to read more, watch or make movies, or listen to or make music	40
26198	4361	Why would something that, yes, is offensive to some, but would grab promote and keep some within it	41
26199	4365	Katherine stated that if everyone had the right to take a book off the shelf then there wouldn't be any books left	0
26200	4365	I think what she is saying is that many people think of a book that is innappropriate, but in another persons eye the book could also be appropriate	1
26201	4365	Censorship is a big deal no-a-days	2
26202	4365	Nobody wants there young children to read about drugs and/or violence	3
26203	4365	I have many opinions upon this issue	4
26204	4365	First I will state why I think the books, or movies, or whatever should be taken off the shelf	5
26205	4365	The books, movies, magazines, ect	6
26206	4365	should be taken off the shelf for being to innappropriate	7
26207	4365	The books and movies are innappropriate by having drugs, sex, violence, and many other things in them that young children shouldn't be subject to watching or reading	8
26208	4365	I know if I was a parent I would not want my young child reading of a violent murder, or gangs	9
26209	4365	The other thing about censorship that it is the peoples choice to read an innappropriate book, or watch an innappropriate movie	10
26210	4365	As a kid myself that is growing up, I didn't really care for reading anyways, but the books that were the best sometimes were the ones with violence in them	11
26211	4365	Also even thought the book @MONTH1 be innappropriate, the child still should have a say in what they are reading	12
26212	4365	This is where my next thought comes in	13
26213	4365	You have to think about the kids that are mature too	14
26214	4365	The kids that are mature, and it is just a hobby to read, @MONTH1 not have any books of their style left to read if they were all 'taken of the shelf'	15
26215	4365	This goes for parents too	16
26216	4365	If they have a book at their house, the child could easily pick it up and read it there	17
26217	4365	What the book stores, libraries, and movie stores should do, is put an age limit on the books and movies	18
26218	4365	I know that for @CAPS1 rated movies there is an age limit, but for explicit books i do not think there is an age limit	19
26219	4365	They could also maybe even get a letter or a note with parent concent on it, so the children could get the book or magazine	20
26220	4365	Maybe the parent should even just come in and get the book or movie for the child	21
26221	4365	The libraries, or book stores, or movie stores could also easily put a warning on the side of the cover to show that the book @MONTH1 be innappropriate to some	22
26222	4365	What the children read is only up to two people: the child and the parent	23
26223	4365	If the parent doesn't care that the child is reading or watching an innappropriate movie then it should be no problem	24
26224	4365	Therefore, I think in order to withhold the buying and selling of books, there has to be the option to obtain the innappropriate ones	25
26225	4365	I feel that even though the material @MONTH1 be explicit, the kids, with their parent's concent, should have the option to check out or buy mostly anything	26
26226	4365	Afterall, the book @MONTH1 be about violence, drugs, or sex, but the children are still reading which is always good	27
26227	4366	I do agree with this topic at hand, some of the material that is being displayed on the shelves at our local library is inappropite or sometimes valgar	0
26228	4366	Way too @MONTH1 people get away with way too many things in this day and age	1
26229	4366	Our society we live in is just a total wreck and complete, utter disaster	2
26230	4366	Something has to be done to put an end to this madness	3
26231	4366	Someone would think that if a librarian put an inappropite book up on the self, that @CAPS1 is inevitable that a child or someone irresponsible would find the book	4
26232	4366	Yet we still witness children reading or looking at a book, type of media, or entainment that is not suitable for their age group	5
26233	4366	Sometimes adults find books that are not pleasing, why would we put them on a self to be publicly displayed	6
26234	4366	That is a question that I have yet to find the solution to	7
26235	4366	I got home from school a couple of days ago and I heard this hip-hop music comming from my nine year old sister's room	8
26236	4366	I started to listen to the lyrics and they were absolutley awful, @CAPS1 was singing about drugs, sex, and alcohol	9
26237	4366	I went in her room and turned @CAPS1 off and questioned her where she got the @ORGANIZATION1 from	10
26238	4366	She replied 'the library.'     That's just another example of what I'm speaking about	11
26239	4366	If someone at the age of nine can check out a @CAPS2.D	12
26240	4366	like that, then imagine what is avalible to me at the age of sixteen	13
26241	4366	Adolessence do not need those kinds of thoughts and words in their vocabulary	14
26242	4366	I'm just afraid for the next generation	15
26243	4366	what are they going to be listening to	16
26244	4366	What are they going to be reading	17
26245	4366	And @CAPS1's not just the library, @CAPS1's everywhere	18
26246	4366	We can't even live a day of our lives in this society with out hearing something bad on the radio, on tv, or even in public	19
26247	4366	Everywhere we turn is something bad or valgar	20
26248	4366	So we need to think about ourselves and our children and try to clean up our acts a little bit	21
26249	4366	We need to stand up for what's appropite and what's right	22
26250	4367	I don't believe that we should romove any books, music, movies, magazines, etc	0
26251	4367	from our libraries due to many reasons	1
26252	4367	This is the real world and the things you read about or watch in a movie @MONTH1 be something you don't want your kids to read about or even see	2
26253	4367	Life is about learnig new things	3
26254	4367	To learn about these ideas, you usually read about or see them somewhere	4
26255	4367	The only way I would ever remove any of these items from a store is if they were going to seriously harm the people or have a negative effect on them	5
26256	4367	If I were to walk into a public library and I saw a book about a girl cutting herself or someone killing another person, I would be the type of person to turn away from it	6
26257	4367	even thought it is what many kids are reading about today	7
26258	4367	Of coarse, every library has books that cover all kinds of topics	8
26259	4367	If you were a parent that was worried about your child reading about these kinds of things, well welcome to life	9
26260	4367	Most books have a true story behind them and I believe that everyone needs to learn about this kind of stuff sometime in their life	10
26261	4367	Most of what we learn today comes from the books we read	11
26262	4367	Also, everyone today listens to music	12
26263	4367	We find music as a way to relax and have a good time wheather your riding in a car or at a party	13
26264	4367	Many of the songs today contain foul language and have sexual meanings, but that doesn't mean that you have to listen to them	14
26265	4367	Many older people don't want to listen to these kinds of songs but it is what many kids are listening to today	15
26266	4367	What many people don't see though, is that these songs have true meaning behind them and it is really a way of life	16
26267	4367	Finally, I believe that magazines, movies, and any other types of media, shouldn't be removed from libraries	17
26268	4367	Many people turn to magazines as a way to relax and read about the latest fashions or their favorite athlete	18
26269	4367	We watch movie to also relax and have a good laugh every once in a while	19
26270	4367	No one should remove these sources of entertainment from our people even if some @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate	20
26271	4367	I strongly believe that romoving any books, magazines, movies, music, or any other typed of media would have a negative effect on alot of people	21
26272	4367	You would be removing sources of entertainment and ways of learning from people	22
26273	4367	How would you feel if you went to your local library one day and most, if not all, materials had been removed	23
26274	4367	What would you do if you didn't have any of these materials available to you anymore	24
26275	4368	I believe that the book that none of us read	0
26276	4368	It should not be on the shelf of any book store i think if the grow up does read it no child should have the right to	1
26277	4368	Also some of the music that is on shelf should be remove from all store	2
26278	4368	Children under the age of @NUM1 shouldnt have any way to get some of this rated r music centrain music shouldnt be on shelfs for little kids to get a hold to	3
26279	4368	So now lets get to the movies that are playing in some of these shows	4
26280	4368	No child under @NUM1 should be able to see half of the things that are showing  and movies because no child should be expose to such things that grow up are most likely expose to	5
26281	4368	That is another way that young children are doing half of the things that they doing the peoples that make certain movies need to think about the children how they would act toward the ones they make	6
26282	4368	Most magazines that are being sold today is giving children the wrong idea	7
26283	4368	When magazine are fill with alot of he say she say things the kids in the world do nothing but think its foreal or ok to do that is spent off the wrong message to the young children	8
26284	4368	And i know you are thinking to yourself like how is that true well kids these days listen to what ever they think is right and half of these magazines make things sound so real.	9
26285	4370	No I as an @CAPS1 cetazine do not feel that any materials should be removed	0
26286	4370	There are many reason I feel this way and I hope that after people have read this they will agree with me	1
26287	4370	THere are three main points supporting my opinion and i plan to list them below	2
26288	4370	First and for most is the fact that this is @LOCATION1	3
26289	4370	@LOCATION1 is suposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, or at least thats what the national anthem tells me	4
26290	4370	So to me if some one removes a book or movie from a library becasue they find it offencive they are trying to take away one of my right as an @CAPS1 cetacine	5
26291	4370	The right they are messing with to me is the right of freedom	6
26292	4370	I should be free to be able to walk into a library and grab any book i wish	7
26293	4370	I should be free to go to the movie store and find and rent any movie a choose from the shelf	8
26294	4370	If they put a movie or book away if they make it to were i can't get to it then they are messing with my freedom, and this is somthing i can't stand as an @CAPS1	9
26295	4370	I should be free to read or watch what ever i choose to	10
26296	4370	Which brings me to my next point	11
26297	4370	This point is a simple and logical one	12
26298	4370	My second point is that people have the choice to read or watch the movie	13
26299	4370	Just because it is there it does not meen that they have to read or watch it	14
26300	4370	If someone doesn't like a book good for them don't read it	15
26301	4370	If someone doesn't like a movie good for them don't watch it	16
26302	4370	It is rather quit simple in my opinion if someone doesn't like said book or movie then just leave it alone and don't mess with it	17
26303	4370	They shouldn't have the right to ruin it for everone else	18
26304	4370	Just because one or two or even twenty people find a book offencive doesn't mean they have the right to remove it	19
26305	4370	There @MONTH1 five million other people out their who love said book so why ruin for everyone just to make a few people happy	20
26306	4370	They do have the right to say no and not read or watch the movie, but they don't have the right to say i can't	21
26307	4370	Finaly people say that said book or movie should be removed because a child might get it and it is not apropreat for children	22
26308	4370	Well to that I have to say it is the parents job to make sure a child is not readind or watching something they shouldn't	23
26309	4370	If i child gets a hold of a book that is said to be bad it is the parents job to tell them to put it back	24
26310	4370	People don't have the right to completly remove said book or movie just because a kid might get it	25
26311	4370	So there is my opinion on this little matter	26
26312	4370	I don't feel that libraries should be censored	27
26313	4370	I feel we all have the right o make own decisions and that we have the right to read or watch what ever we choose	28
26314	4370	It is not fair to get ride of a book just because a few people don't like it	29
26315	4370	Hundreds of othes might love it, and like I said before if someone doesn't like a certain movie or book then don't read it or watch it	30
26316	4370	Don't ruin it for everyone else though.	31
26317	4371	Many people have different views on different types of things	0
26318	4371	There is not much that can be helped with that	1
26319	4371	No one can never make everybody happy	2
26320	4371	That is a major part of life	3
26321	4371	I do not think they should remove materials from libraries just because some people find them offensive	4
26322	4371	You cannot make everyone happy, some people enjoy those materials, and everyone is entitiled to their own opinion	5
26323	4371	The first reason they should not remove offensive materials from the library is because you will not make everybody happy by doing that	6
26324	4371	Just because some people take offense to certain things, does not mean that everyone does	7
26325	4371	If they do not like it, they do not have to read it or listen to it	8
26326	4371	They have libraries so you can pick out books (and other materials) that you like	9
26327	4371	You have a choice there	10
26328	4371	There are lots of books that are at libraries around the world	11
26329	4371	People are going to be mad whether they are there or not	12
26330	4371	Have you ever heard the saying '@CAPS1't judge a book by its cover?' @CAPS2, well that could also be a reason people want materials removed	13
26331	4371	They might see a 'suggestive' cover or something, and they might take total offense to that	14
26332	4371	Just because a cover of a book might make people take offense to it doesn't mean they should remove it	15
26333	4371	The second reason offensive materials should not be removed is because it is enjoyable for some people	16
26334	4371	There is a reason it is in the library, and that reason is because some people enjoy it	17
26335	4371	If there was a book or magazine that never got checked out, do you think they would keep it	18
26336	4371	Nope	19
26337	4371	I am pretty sure if it never got checked out, they would get rid of it	20
26338	4371	Obviously someone has to read, listen, or watch it	21
26339	4371	People get offended by things everyday	22
26340	4371	Removing 'offensive' materials from libraries will not be much help to the problem	23
26341	4371	It @MONTH1 help a little, but there are still going to be people who get offended so easily	24
26342	4371	The third reason they should keep materials is because everyone is entitled to their own opinion	25
26343	4371	Just because some people think that there are offensive materials in the library does not mean other people do	26
26344	4371	For some people, taking away things like that would be like making kids at school wear uniforms	27
26345	4371	It takes away freedom	28
26346	4371	We are living in @LOCATION1	29
26347	4371	@LOCATION1 is supposed to be a free country	30
26348	4371	It is really not a free country when you have people taking away books and movies because they are offensive to people	31
26349	4371	I got news for you	32
26350	4371	If you @CAPS1't like it, @CAPS1't read it	33
26351	4371	There is no harm at all by keeping materials on shelves	34
26352	4371	No matter what, someone is always going to take offense to something	35
26353	4371	The world is not perfect, and it is never going to be perfect	36
26354	4371	Taking materials off the shelves because it is offensive to some people isn't going to make the world a better place	37
26355	4371	People are going to be mad or angry no matter what happens	38
26356	4372	Some books are offensive but not all of them	0
26357	4372	Some libraries have begun to censor their book collection by removing ones they thought could be offensive	1
26358	4372	I believe there should not be any censorship in libraries	2
26359	4372	One reason I do not believe that there should be censorship in libraries is that tons of good books are lost because of it	3
26360	4372	Some libraries do not carry @PERSON1 books because he uses curse words	4
26361	4372	They should not remove the books completely they should just warn people of the language	5
26362	4372	A second reason why I do not believe in censorship is that some books on different religions get removed	6
26363	4372	I once saw a librarian throw a book away simply because it was about the @CAPS1 religion	7
26364	4372	This was a horrible action because the @CAPS1 religion is an extremely interesting one and now many people will never know anything about it	8
26365	4372	A third reason is that they @MONTH1 end up offending some people by removing a book	9
26366	4372	I once heard of an @CAPS3 family complaining about a library because they removed a book about the @CAPS3 religion	10
26367	4372	I found this upsetting because everyone deserves to have access to the books that they want	11
26368	4372	I propose that instead of censorship the libraries seperate the books by different subjects and genres then put up signs warning anyone that goes into that section	12
26369	4372	This way everyone can get the books that they want to get	13
26370	4372	The libraries also would not have to worry about people being offended	14
26371	4372	I believe there should not be any censorship in libraries	15
26372	4372	Some libraries have begun to censor their book selection by removing ones they thought could be offensive.Some books are offensive but not all of them.	16
26373	4373	Throughout time, fellow people have struggled to censor or ban material that they consider offensive	0
26374	4373	It @MONTH1 be the way they were brought up, or simply what they beleive	1
26375	4373	I do not beleive that it should be up to anyone to say what should and should not be censored for anyone but themselves	2
26376	4373	Everyone has one life, and in this one life we create our personal oppinions and beliefs on what is wrong and what is right	3
26377	4373	We are completely unaware of many people throughout our life cycles, and saying what should be banned from everybody is almost claiming you know the morals, beliefs, and customs of everyone in the world	4
26378	4373	If I came to school one day and brought a book that contained material that I think is relevant and not just pure exploitation, then I should be able to read that as long as I don't influence others by their own will	5
26379	4373	Let's say another student sees me reading that same book and he has grown up in a household that taught him that the situations and material in my book are overly offensive, I do not think he should be able to create a ban of this book just because of his own upbringing	6
26380	4373	There is such a thing as mass agreement, but there is also a thing called mass ignorance, and to say that I know what should and should not be shown to other people is completely ignorant on my part	7
26381	4373	I think the only allowance of censorship should be from parent to child	8
26382	4373	That is the only situation that someone should be allowed authority over someone else, because they have undeniable duties as parents, and they be able to say what is right knowing they are creating a child to think what is wrong and what is right in their mind	9
26383	4375	Censorship is when a group of people agree that a certain book, song, movie, or magazine is found offensive in any way	0
26384	4375	Mainly parents and educators find these materials such as books offensive and do what they can to get this book taken out of libraries at schools	1
26385	4375	Censorship was originally started during the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in @LOCATION3 with the @CAPS3 @CAPS4	2
26386	4375	It was used to hide information from the public by taking all records of it away from the public's use	3
26387	4375	In @LOCATION2, we are a democracy, but we still choose censorship to hide certain information from certain people	4
26388	4375	In some parents' opinions books are great and educational for children, but in other parents' opinions books do things like promote homosexuality, use false language, or even show drug use	5
26389	4375	Most of these books are not trying too promote these things but they are just part of the story	6
26390	4375	So pretend like we hide all the bad events or situations in the world from occuring infront of our children	7
26391	4375	They have no knowledge of this part of life, so what happens when they get in the real world and grow up	8
26392	4375	We can't just hide drugs from them, we can read these and teach them the harm drugs can do to someone and how to avoid them	9
26393	4375	If we send our children out into this world without any knowledge of drugs things will get out of control	10
26394	4375	Majority of these books that contain 'harmful' things to children, but they teach lessons that parents don't think of, they just think of what written down on the paper instead of the moral overall lesson that the story is bringing to a child	11
26395	4375	If a story has false language, our child will ask us what these words mean and we will tell them not to use them and what they mean so the child knows not to repeat them	12
26396	4375	If not, they can go into school and another child will tell your child to say these words and your child (not knowing the meaning of the word) will go out and say it and be awarded with a detention or even a suspension	13
26397	4375	Personally, I don't want my child receiving a detention or suspension	14
26398	4375	Censorship is a growing issue in the @LOCATION1	15
26399	4375	It can do good things like hide actual sexual interactions from children, which should be hid from children anyways	16
26400	4375	Censorship can also do the bad things like I discussed earlier, which do more harm on a child then good	17
26401	4375	When your asked on your opinion on sensorship, just always remember what's best for your child, and knowledge is always better then clueless	18
26402	4376	Going to the library is one of the best ways to explore new things	0
26403	4376	Some items are not appropriate for everyone though	1
26404	4376	Certain books, movies, magazines, and music should not be accessed by everyone	2
26405	4376	Having an adult only section would be a way to solve this problem	3
26406	4376	Removing certain materials from the library would not be in good interest	4
26407	4376	Any popular material should be available at the library	5
26408	4376	Many best selling books would be wrong for children to read, but they would be perfectly fine for adults	6
26409	4376	That doesn't mean these books need to be taken out of the library	7
26410	4376	Children should be restricted from viewing the explicit materials though	8
26411	4376	Having a section in the library from which only adults can rent the items, would remove this problem	9
26412	4376	People under @NUM1 should also be restrained from looking through these materials	10
26413	4376	Having a childrens' section in the libray would also keep them away from adult materials	11
26414	4376	The library needs to make itself user friendly	12
26415	4376	People who frequent the library often pick up a book, not knowing what it holds	13
26416	4376	When inappropriate material is inside a child might innocently read into or see something they are not supposed to	14
26417	4376	Parents should not have to worry about their kids seeing inappropriate pictures or text	15
26418	4376	They should feel safe letting their children look through all the books at the library	16
26419	4376	Library workers should also make sure the adult materials stay in the hands of adults	17
26420	4376	Allowing children and their parents to feel safe and welcome is an important part of the library	18
26421	4376	Taking adult materials out of the libray is not a good idea	19
26422	4376	It would lower its popularity	20
26423	4376	Everyone has different interests, and they want to research them at the library	21
26424	4376	The safety of children is also important	22
26425	4376	Making sure children cannot reach these materials is a concern	23
26426	4376	Having separate adult and children sections could solve this problem	24
26427	4376	Not allowing anyone under @NUM1 to check out explicit materials would also help	25
26428	4376	Keeping the libray full of information but still safe for children is the ideal situation	26
26429	4377	I believe that not all books should be banned, but some books should	0
26430	4377	For example their are many good books that are banned because it @MONTH1 have a little bit of cussing in them but I believe that is ok, I mean it isn't like the child wouldn't hear the same words maybe even worse if he turned on his @CAPS1	1
26431	4377	But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned, such as hate against other races, or it talks negatively about someones religion	2
26432	4377	For example I read a very famous book called The @CAPS2 of @PERSON3 by @PERSON4	3
26433	4377	This was a very good book but for some reason it was banned in my @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 so I couldn't check it out	4
26434	4377	I had to go to the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to get it	5
26435	4377	I don't understand what is so wrong with The @CAPS2 of @PERSON3 that it is banned by @ORGANIZATION2	6
26436	4377	This book @MONTH1 talk of a mischevious youngster who runs away, does alot of differnt crazy activites, and even smokes but this is no worst then what we are exposed too on @CAPS1	7
26437	4377	If I was a administrator in a @ORGANIZATION1 I would look at what is the meaning behind the book and what it is trying to express	8
26438	4377	For example if a book is offensive to some one for instance a book written by the @PERSON1, this piece shouldn't be aloud on the shelve	9
26439	4377	But if it is a book about the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and the @ORGANIZATION3's view on slavery this would be ok	10
26440	4377	Because the @PERSON2 book is more hate than anything it is for instance promoting the @PERSON2 and that isnt right	11
26441	4377	But the book on the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and the @ORGANIZATION3's view on slavery is a part of our history it shows differnt ways of thinking of the time that we don't really know if they were right or wrong it is just what they believed	12
26442	4377	So my point I am trying to express in this piece is that don't hate a book because maybe the language in it or the events in it @MONTH1 not be what you agree with but judge the book because of the message that it is trying to express.Hopefully you will agree with me in this	13
26443	4377	But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned, such as hate against other races, or it talks negatively about someones religion	14
26444	4377	I have expressed my opinion on this matter I hope you agree with me and can maybe convince the @ORGANIZATION1 that they need to take a second look at what kind of books we keep on our shelves and what kind of books we take off our shelves.	15
26445	4378	Whever you go these days you see viloence in evry store around the world	0
26446	4378	Children growing up in the world is our future and they see that negative output	1
26447	4378	Alot of the kids and young adults thrive off of the offensive materials the world puts out there	2
26448	4378	I think that the offensive thing's should be taken off the shelves	3
26449	4378	And sold in stores for adults that are twenty one and older	4
26450	4378	If people sell offensive things in stores were it allows young teenagers to buy those products , then we are just puting ourselfs at harm	5
26451	4378	I was just in a book store the other day and i seen magazines that were not apporiate	6
26452	4378	I thought to myself how could they sell these types of magazines	7
26453	4378	Music , movies, and magazines shouldn't even be sold in a book store , that's why its called a book store	8
26454	4378	It's not called a movie, music , or magazine store they call it a book store for a reason	9
26455	4378	If students read books or listen to music that is offensive they are going to grow up thinking it's ok	10
26456	4378	Too be that way or treat somebody different because of who they are or what they represent	11
26457	4378	I'm not saying take all the books out of the store just take the offensive one's and have a twenty one or older sign	12
26458	4378	So the kids dont end up getting a hold of the book and learning something they shouldn't	13
26459	4378	When i was young i went to the book store all the time with my mom	14
26460	4378	I would just pick up any book there was and start trying to read	15
26461	4378	Alot of the time my mom would take the book from me	16
26462	4378	Because it was offensive, i didn't know that at the time i was just a little kid	17
26463	4378	In today's society kids are growing up quicker than they really have to and thats not a good thing	18
26464	4378	Kids should be able to be kids and read kid's books	19
26465	4378	I guess it does'nt really matter for middle school and high school kids	20
26466	4378	Because those kids really dont like to read at all	21
26467	4378	The kids that we have to look out for is the one's in elementary	22
26468	4378	Because those kid's actually want to learn how to read	23
26469	4378	And if we put a book about drugs on the shelve those kids will read it	24
26470	4378	And those kids will learn about it and be curious to what that drug has a effect on you	25
26471	4378	In the end it does'nt really matter what i say because people are going to keep making books	26
26472	4378	Anytime type of book it is all based on how much money they can make	27
26473	4378	It does'nt matter if it is negative or a possitive book	28
26474	4378	the company wants to make money and so does the author.	29
26475	4379	There is many different topics that could be offensive, @CAPS5 just depends on the person's own personal judgement	0
26476	4379	In my opinion I do not believe that materials should be removed because not everyone has the same view or opinons	1
26477	4379	If someone comes from a different country or evern a different religion, topics like abortion and racism are going to be viewed very differently	2
26478	4379	I think having a variety of topics will help expand different thoughts and make the readers of the material see things in a different way	3
26479	4379	When I am older and if one of my elementary children was to bring home a book over abortion, I would be concerned	4
26480	4379	Honestly though, I do not believe schools would let inapropriate topics for younger childeren read books like that	5
26481	4379	@CAPS5 is a little bit different with a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 student though	6
26482	4379	Their maturity level is going to be mature enough to handle the material and I do not think @CAPS5 is right for schools to remove something that could actually help someone	7
26483	4379	In the book, 'A @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5', there is a lot of detailed events that happen	8
26484	4379	Some might say @CAPS5 is too graphic for children but the reality of @CAPS5 is, events like those happen in today's society	9
26485	4379	@CAPS5 really opened up my eyes and I am extremely happy I read @CAPS5	10
26486	4379	The realization actually made me want to help those children who grow up in homes like the one described in the book	11
26487	4379	I believe @CAPS5 had the same effect on other people too and some children might even grow up to help others in that horrible situation	12
26488	4379	Libraries should be able to have a variety of different books	13
26489	4379	I am not saying however that they should have books on murder and saying @CAPS5 is alright but books that will help expand the children's minds	14
26490	4379	@CAPS5 could even change their lives	15
26491	4379	Some books are a sensitvie topic but who has the right to tell someone something they should believe	16
26492	4379	@CAPS5 would mean more to someone if they found their own way and beliefs then having people tell them what they should and should not do or believe in	17
26493	4379	I have also read a book recently titled, '@CAPS6', @CAPS5 is about the government granting the ability to @CAPS6 your children and then the body parts will go to those in need	18
26494	4379	@CAPS5 is sort of cruel in one way but the topic the author is trying to get across is not	19
26495	4379	A quote from the book is, 'On one side you have people killing abortion doctors for the right of life and on the other you have people getting pregnant just to sell their fetal tissue'	20
26496	4379	@CAPS5 states that everywhere you go people are going to disagree and agree on things but not everyone will believe in the same thing	21
26497	4379	@CAPS5 shows that just because one person thinks one way is right does not mean another will	22
26498	4379	The book changed my perspective on many different topics and helped me open my eyes on different views	23
26499	4379	Racism, abortion, @CAPS3 abuse, unwinding your children, what ever the case @MONTH1 be, some people will support @CAPS5 and some will not	24
26500	4379	I think @CAPS5 is time for children around the world to discover for themselves what they truely believe in and taking 'offensive' material from @CAPS2 libraries is not going to help any	25
26501	4379	My opinion on this topic is strongly advising to leave the material alone because for there to be a book about @CAPS5, the author had to have had a reason to write @CAPS5 and honestly, what is better for the future then a generation of children grounded to their own true beliefs	26
26502	4380	Since the beginning there has always been someone who is offended by certain media	0
26503	4380	Books, movies, and music have been the main focus of the subject of this controversy	1
26504	4380	There have been arguments over it so severe that it has went to court	2
26505	4380	The people that have been upset over media have caused there to be certain censorships over these materials	3
26506	4380	I believe that there should not be censorship in media	4
26507	4380	I think that there are are books, movies, and other media materials that can be found offensive to someone or a group of people	5
26508	4380	This is why they should have labels or at least a description on the back of these products that explain what could cause someone to become upset by it	6
26509	4380	If something is considered too vulgar for the public eye then they should have it somewhere more discret, but not be taken off the shelves	7
26510	4380	I disagree that media materials should be taken of shelves for being offensive	8
26511	4380	Media is all about someones free expression and trying to share it with the world	9
26512	4380	There are around @NUM1 billion people in the world and at least one of them is bound to enjoy the same type of media you do	10
26513	4380	A great example of a media material that is challenged every day in every part of the world is a book called the bible	11
26514	4380	The bible is considered to be one of the oldest books in the world and is still in print	12
26515	4380	People of different religions can sometimes find the print of bibles over there religious books offensive and there is always great controversy about it	13
26516	4380	All these movies and books though are great because they are different and free	14
26517	4380	The world needs people who challenge ideas and religions	15
26518	4380	Every single person in the world is unique and I think it is great for everyone to put their opinions out for others to find so they can have a new view on the subject or at least contemplate it	16
26519	4380	Society has already put parental advisory warnings on cds, put ratings on movies, and labeled books as challenged	17
26520	4380	All this does is restrict the public from finding new ideas to compare to and form opinions	18
26521	4380	I believe in freedom of thinking because it is the most valuable resource that we have, it is what sets us apart from each other	19
26522	4380	Let media be free so men, women, and children from all over the globe can be unique and wonderful	20
26523	4380	Censorship will be challenged in years to come and I will help challenge it for all to be free and happy	21
26524	4381	Books,music,movies, and magazines that are in libraries should be approprete material	0
26525	4381	But in some cases it's fine to have some offensive litature because people can learn from it	1
26526	4381	But there needs to be an age limit to checking out these itims out	2
26527	4381	So I do beleave we should keep offensive litature on the shelve	3
26528	4381	There needs to be a certian exstent to what we leave on the shelves	4
26529	4381	Books,books, and more books, there are so many books and many other kinds of litature in libraries today	5
26530	4381	Libraries are a place of silance, and to some people thats boreing	6
26531	4381	So like me when I go into a librarie I go to the books, or maginzes that seem very intresting to me	7
26532	4381	Altho they @MONTH1 seem intreseting to me, others @MONTH1 find them offensive	8
26533	4381	Like it might be a comic book that my say something that someone my take offense to	9
26534	4381	Libraries can't please everyone that walks throught the doors	10
26535	4381	Just because someone dose not like the offensive stuff thats in there dosen't mean they have to take it out	11
26536	4381	Because there might be someone like me that likes thoes kind of books, or magazines	12
26537	4381	There are offensive stuff all over the world so you can't avoid it every where you go	13
26538	4381	I beleave there is a good out come for keeping offensive litature material on the shelves	14
26539	4381	I think that keeping offensive material in libraries @MONTH1 have a good cause to it for one very good reason, learning	15
26540	4381	Like I said before it @MONTH1 be offensive to some people but to some it's not	16
26541	4381	So some people might like to learn about offensive things	17
26542	4381	@MONTH1 be they never knew thoes things that are in thoes books	18
26543	4381	They @MONTH1 also never know whats in thoes books unless they keep them on the shelves	19
26544	4381	They need to have a section where offensive books,magazines,music and movies go	20
26545	4381	If some things it's offensive put it on the shelve, and they must be @NUM1 years old to check it out if it's on that shelve	21
26546	4381	Yeah there @MONTH1 be a down fall to keeping offensive things in libraries	22
26547	4381	But you can't hide from it all your life .So insted of going out into the world and learning about it the hard way go to the librarie	23
26548	4381	You could pick a book up learn about it and how to deal with it	24
26549	4381	It's just part of live there is offensive material every where	25
26550	4381	You can't be shelterd your whole live	26
26551	4381	So in my greatest opinon I do beleave that we should keep these offensive material in libraries, it could be a learing exsperiance	27
26552	4383	I think that the cencorship in libraries should defenetly be relevant	0
26553	4383	Such as i think that if someone wants to check out an adult book they should be required to show id at desk	1
26554	4383	Many children take advantage of this they rent books and games they know parents would never allow	2
26555	4383	A cencory system should be a quit simple arrangment fot the public library systems	3
26556	4383	Private libraries can do as they choose they are not under any state law	4
26557	4383	On the other hand public libraries are under state and city law they should not be able to show adult things to children	5
26558	4383	For example in many libraries around the @CAPS1.S there all books called manga or anime books alot of them show partial nudity and other graphic things not suitable for younger children but are only rated @NUM1+	6
26559	4383	I think there could be many changes in the library systems it is your choice if  you want to change them or not	7
26560	4384	I do not believe that materiales in libraries should be censored	0
26561	4384	If parents don't want their children reading or listening to inappropriate things, they should pay more attention to what they are doing	1
26562	4384	If parents monitor their children closer they will be able to control what they are doing	2
26563	4384	There are alot of bad things for children to read, look at, and listen too out there	3
26564	4384	Parents need to do a better job teaching their children about what they can and should look at, read, or listen too	4
26565	4384	It isn't often when you go to the library that you find something inappropriate unless you are looking for something inappropriate	5
26566	4384	It is very easy to tell what is good and what is bad	6
26567	4384	Most of the time in a library the more profound books and magazines are seperated from the childrens books	7
26568	4384	This, to me, is the way it should be in all libraries	8
26569	4384	In all of the times i have been to a library i have never accedentally come across something inappropriate	9
26570	4384	A library is a place for people of all ages it should not be limited to just one age group	10
26571	4384	If libraries were censored more people would be upset	11
26572	4384	It would be the same way if a store stopped selling your favorite product because one person did not like it	12
26573	4384	Alot of adults probably would not go if the library were censored	13
26574	4384	The library would then become a place for mostly children	14
26575	4384	Most small children do not even go to the library so they would become virtually useless	15
26576	4384	In all of my years I have never once heard of someone being deeply offended by something at a library	16
26577	4384	Weather it be in a magazine, on the news, or by word of mouf, I have never seen a complaint	17
26578	4384	Most parents do a good job of monitering what the children look at or read	18
26579	4384	Those parents should not be deprived of their privelages to look at more adult rated things if they choose	19
26580	4384	Just because one parent was to irresponsible to moniter their child does not mean that all of the parents should be punished	20
26581	4384	The library is a place for people of all ages	21
26582	4384	Therefor the library should keep material for people of all ages and not just for children	22
26583	4384	The bottomline is that if people do not want their kids looking at inappropriate things they should keep a better watch over them	23
26584	4384	They should also teach them the difference in what is acceptable and what is not acceptable.	24
26585	4385	Censoring books in libraries because a certain group of people doesn't like them, and finds them offensive is simply not fair	0
26586	4385	A good library is diverse and has something that everyone of different backgrounds can enjoy	1
26587	4385	A compromise wouldn't be as difficult as some people might actually think	2
26588	4385	Simply regulating books, and other products, by creating age limits based on the books content and maturity level would be an excellent alternative to actually censoring the books themselves	3
26589	4385	Take an author like @PERSON1 for example	4
26590	4385	His books contain subject matter and offensive crude language that would obviously not be deemed acceptable for most younger people	5
26591	4385	That being said censoring the books language wouldn't help in the slightest	6
26592	4385	If a younger person has the mental capability to read a book like @PERSON1 then they would have no problem making inferences on what matierial was said, and the ideas in the writing are going to be realized	7
26593	4385	The other fact is that taking out mature level books completley from the libraries is not a possible solution either	8
26594	4385	If you take out the diversity in your product your going to lose the diversity in your customer's as well	9
26595	4385	For instance think about a movie store	10
26596	4385	If the only movies sold were @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 there would be a lot less people wanting to go to that store, because then it just turns into a child's store	11
26597	4385	Even censoring the movies would not be effective because your taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie	12
26598	4385	So my simple solution is obvious	13
26599	4385	Movies have ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books	14
26600	4385	Books that deal with more controversal content shouldn't be placed in the shelves next to young readers' books, and they should have a label indicating that the specific book @MONTH1 contain material not suitable for a person under a specific age	15
26601	4385	People trying to censor entertainment and look into the best interest of their loved ones is perfectly fine, but you cant blindfold them forever	16
26602	4385	Were all on the same planet and we all reach the age of realization of reality.	17
26603	4387	Do you think books, music, movies, magazines, etc	0
26604	4387	that could be offenesive should or should not be pulled off the shelves	1
26605	4387	I beleave they shouldn't	2
26606	4387	All kinds of people buy books or movies and they all have diffrent types they like	3
26607	4387	Companies that manufactor books, movies, music, and magazines would be looseing out on money if people cant find something they like	4
26608	4387	and if they dont have the money to make whatever it is they make then they will go out of buiesness	5
26609	4387	They you might be out of luck for what you are looking for	6
26610	4387	All kinds of people buy things that they like	7
26611	4387	How would you like it if your favorite candy was taken off the shevles because it offened people	8
26612	4387	Well thats how they feel when that happens to them	9
26613	4387	What would be put in there places	10
26614	4387	Stores have to have something to fill the shevles	11
26615	4387	Would they put more candy to make the world fat	12
26616	4387	If you come across something you think is offensive just dont pay attenion to it	13
26617	4387	Others @MONTH1 like it like you like your favorite candy	14
26618	4387	We have a great number of other things you can pick from	15
26619	4388	A curious child goes into the library for the first time to find a story to read	0
26620	4388	Yet, when she goes to the children's section, the book she wants is not allowed in this library becuase it is said to promote certain ideals to children	1
26621	4388	The child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book	2
26622	4388	The older sister is to busy looking for her own book	3
26623	4388	She had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic	4
26624	4388	She can't find the book she wants, the library has censored it	5
26625	4388	Why would we censor librairies if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech	6
26626	4388	It is not right to censor libraries becuase that is restricitng what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom	7
26627	4388	The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it	8
26628	4388	Will that be the next thing that is censored	9
26629	4388	A book is just like the newspaper, it is relaying a story to entertain the auidence that is reading it	10
26630	4388	By censoring libraires that is taking away the freedom of speech	11
26631	4388	Writing is a way to express yourself	12
26632	4388	Authors share there expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance	13
26633	4388	Whether the book helps its reader to escape a horrendus day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager	14
26634	4388	I use books daily to escape the stresses of life, the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind, I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me	15
26635	4388	Some @MONTH1 say that offensive things should be censored	16
26636	4388	In our culture the slightest thing can called 'offensive' now	17
26637	4388	If we never learn about these 'offensive' things how would we understand history	18
26638	4388	There will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it	19
26639	4388	By censoring these items we will never learn and  neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas	20
26640	4388	Instead of censoring items, there is another solution	21
26641	4388	Make certain items restricted and red flagged	22
26642	4388	If certain items become restricted	23
26643	4388	it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them	24
26644	4388	By doing this a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them	25
26645	4388	If there was a system to red flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose their selves to it if they did not want to, but others could	26
26646	4388	This would work becuase the books could stay in the library and still be used but there would be a warning system for those who do not want to be around it or allow their children to be around it	27
26647	4388	In conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea	28
26648	4388	It takes away our freedom of the press and speech.We are also making ourselves ignorant this way	29
26649	4388	If we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone	30
26650	4388	The 'offensive' matterial can stay in the libaries but people will know ahead of time what they are being exposed to and what their children are to	31
26651	4389	I think that no source of knowledge should taken off any shelf in any librairy because a few people think it's offensive	0
26652	4389	In my own personal opinion someone could find a book offensive and another person could think it is reasonable	1
26653	4389	People can't make the judgment to say this is offensive to me so therefore it's offensive to everyone who reads it	2
26654	4389	Some of the best books on our shevles are the ones that @MONTH1 be offensive	3
26655	4389	Some books are racist	4
26656	4389	Of @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 for example has some racist and sexist comments and remarks	5
26657	4389	If everyone got mad about that then a very good book wouldn't be read by the people who are going to run the country when i'm older	6
26658	4389	I know that all the older books would be gone to and then no one would know about what happened in the @NUM1's	7
26659	4389	Also some of the @ORGANIZATION1 shows people watch are ten times worse then the books people read,if you find a book offensive don't read it	8
26660	4389	When i hear about a book being offensive it makes me want to read it	9
26661	4389	It gives the book charactor and makes it humorouse	10
26662	4389	We can't just have the same old books talking about the same old things because that gets boring after a while	11
26663	4389	Sometimes from thoughs books you even learn something about your self that makes you wonder if i didn't read this book would i still have found this out	12
26664	4389	Sometimes it brings out the best in people and thats the best part about reading a book like that	13
26665	4389	Libraries are a place to go and look at all the books you could ever think of reading and no one should be able to take that away from people	14
26666	4389	I want my kids to be able to have the same options that i had growing up plus all the new books coming out	15
26667	4389	If you ask me it's just not right to take away someone elses choice of knowledge	16
26668	4389	Thats my personal opinion on taking books off the shelves of public libraries.	17
26669	4390	I believe that things shouldn't be taken off the shelfs because a few people are offended	0
26670	4390	There @MONTH1 be a few that don't like something but for every few that don't like it there are some who do	1
26671	4390	For example there might be a book that makes females look dumb but personally it doesn't affect me but there are some girls who get offended because thier superior knowledge	2
26672	4390	I have a friend who gets offended by movies that the black guy always gets in trouble or dies first	3
26673	4390	So if we removed every movie that offended him what would be left	4
26674	4390	I feel offensive when a magazine shows girls are pretty because it makes people feel insecure about themselves	5
26675	4390	Even though I feel offended I'm not going to request them to remove it because there are some magazines that give tips and actually helps people feel better about themselves and if I took that away from them it could cause issues	6
26676	4390	If there is something that is removed from shelves it should have a good reason	7
26677	4390	Like if there was a magazine that showed nudity I would understand them removing it so a kid doesn't see it.Some libraries remove things that could potentially cause a great issue	8
26678	4390	Maybe a newspaper talks about a great disaster and every one swarms the stand attacking each other	9
26679	4390	Something like that can cause people to be hospitalized and then the library will be sued	10
26680	4390	Yes I agree that there are some people who would request the  stuff to be removed but you can't always get your way	11
26681	4390	I know people would say thats not fair but there is a saying that says 'life isn't fair' and thats true	12
26682	4390	So next time you hear some one wanting something removed tall them this or next time you want some thing removed you refer back to this	13
26683	4390	So in conclusion things shouldn't be removed unless nessecary	14
26684	4390	So when someone is offended thats their problem	15
26685	4390	You can always walk away you dont have to look or listen.	16
26686	4391	I believe that the certain materials such as books,music,movies, magazines, ect	0
26687	4391	they are here for a reason	1
26688	4391	People like them	2
26689	4391	Maybe there are some books and things that people @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not find offensive	3
26690	4391	Thats ok I'm not try to say it isn't, but you don't have to look at that book	4
26691	4391	There are so many others to pick from it doesn't have to be the first one you pick up	5
26692	4391	The objects we are talking about are our entertainment it brings us joy and many smiles	6
26693	4391	People need to understand that children are going to have to get their education not only from their teachers,but through these tools	7
26694	4391	Tools is a better word for these things	8
26695	4391	It makes them have a meaning	9
26696	4391	Children now day love books, music,movies, magazines,ect	10
26697	4391	As a teenager I can say that most of us who like music we love it	11
26698	4391	It builds our charater	12
26699	4391	People don't make books and magazines just for them to sit on a shelf and gather dust	13
26700	4391	They were ment to be picked up and look at	14
26701	4391	I also have to say that some people make a big deal about a subject like this	15
26702	4391	Don't get me wrong I can understand were their opinon stands,but that doesn't mean I have to agree	16
26703	4391	Children,@CAPS1,and @CAPS2 all have to learn in one way or another	17
26704	4391	Some of these ways are what some people are trying to get removed from our libraries and other places as well	18
26705	4391	If people want this is going to be a big war	19
26706	4391	Only because they are not the only people on the planet	20
26707	4391	People want these tools of ours to be removed this will only be the begin	21
26708	4391	Next couple of years from now people will want to get rid of something else then, something else	22
26709	4391	Its just one right after another it won't stop	23
26710	4391	This just shows how our communities agree and disagree with each other	24
26711	4391	Everyone is intitled to their own opinion some are good and some are bad	25
26712	4391	In this case, my opinion I totally and completely disagree with getting rid of the tools that can inprove our world as we know it to be.	26
26713	4392	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	0
26714	4392	No	1
26715	4392	I strongly disagree	2
26716	4392	D     @CAPS1 you know that there is more than @CAPS5 radio station	3
26717	4392	Well, @CAPS3 you do	4
26718	4392	Not just @CAPS5 person should be able to talk for everyone	5
26719	4392	I enjoy every genre of music and books	6
26720	4392	@CAPS4's pretty much my life	7
26721	4392	All I know is that when I get offended by a song, I change @CAPS4	8
26722	4392	When I'm reading a book I don't like, I put @CAPS4 down	9
26723	4392	@CAPS4's not your job to make my decisions	10
26724	4392	I live my own life and personally think you should live yours as well	11
26725	4392	Books, movies, plays, games, magazines, all things of that sort are for our entertainment	12
26726	4392	If they began taking them off shelves because of vulgar things and things that offend people, then why do we have freedom of speech	13
26727	4392	Those people that are offended need to put whatever @CAPS4 is down and move on	14
26728	4392	Just because a handful of people are offended by the everyday things that people use to stay amused, doesn't mean they need to be taken away	15
26729	4392	Authors and directors spend months, even years making movies and writing books just to entertain us and feel accomplished	16
26730	4392	If they started taking them off our shelves and off the big screens, people would lose jobs	17
26731	4392	For example look at the @PERSON2 @ORGANIZATION1	18
26732	4392	That can easily offend a person, but those are brilliant pieces of work	19
26733	4392	I am personally the kind of person that reads books that are suspenseful, books that keep me on the edge of my seat	20
26734	4392	People enjoy books that they can relate to, and some people can relate to those books that are 'offensive.' I, myself, have read a book that cinsisted of drugs and viloence that I related to and @CAPS4 helped me out, @CAPS4 made me realize its not always the right thing to do	21
26735	4392	I think people need to realize that all those books, movies, magazines, and all the aboe that 'offend' them, are reality	22
26736	4392	No matter where you go, what you do, what you throw out, or what you keep in the house, your kids, parenst, friends, everyone will see @CAPS4 sometime in theirlives	23
26737	4392	Viloence and drugs are seen everyday	24
26738	4392	Many more things that offend people are always going to be there	25
26739	4392	If all of those things are offensive to some people, then they need a reality check	26
26740	4392	Books like that can influence kids to wanna go the rightdirection	27
26741	4392	They read a book or see a movie with a drug addict in prison and theyll think, '@CAPS2, I'm never going there.' @CAPS3, I can't say that goes for all kids in this world, but you get the jist of what I'm trying to say	28
26742	4392	If @CAPS4's the parents that are worried about their kids getting into that kind of stuff, be my guest to remove @CAPS4 from your household, but not from everyone, not from the people who enjoy @CAPS4	29
26743	4392	I'm a strong believer that people know right from wrong, so why not just grow up a little bit and do what's right	30
26744	4392	Those books, movies, and magazines that are offensive, are enjoyable to me	31
26745	4392	This makes me think of drama	32
26746	4392	People say they hate @CAPS4, but no matter what, @CAPS4's everywhere, and @CAPS4 will always be everywhere	33
26747	4392	If you can't get through life being offended every @CAPS3 and then, then how do you think you'll survuve	34
26748	4392	What do you think is in store for the next years to come	35
26749	4392	You must learn to deal with @CAPS4	36
26750	4392	Taking away all of these things, I think, is a mistake	37
26751	4392	If people are against @CAPS4, they need to worry about themselves and just leave @CAPS4 alone	38
26752	4392	They can make their own decisions, they don't have to pick up and @PERSON1 book when there is a @ORGANIZATION1 in their reach	39
26753	4392	That is what literature is about, writing	40
26754	4392	Do you honeslty think the author was worried about offending anyone	41
26755	4392	No, because the author or director whom wrote the book or made the movie, they knew what is was about and they know that not all of the world will see @CAPS4	42
26756	4392	Not all of the world will care to see @CAPS4	43
26757	4392	They know that people are smart enough to read the summary before they get'offended.'      @CAPS4 irritates me when people think they need to live for everyone	44
26758	4392	@CAPS4's like the saying, '@CAPS5 man's trash is another man's treasure.' You might not like @CAPS4, you might even hate @CAPS4	45
26759	4392	But once @CAPS4's out of your hands, the next person might come back and drastically fall in love with @CAPS4	46
26760	4392	I think that just because someone picks up a book and @CAPS4 offends them, @CAPS4 doesn't mean they needed to whiped off the shelves	47
26761	4392	Grow up, put whatever @CAPS4 is that offends you down, and walk away.	48
26762	4393	In this world you never know what someone might writing	0
26763	4393	There're many materials in this world that I think aren't appropiate for someone to be reading, watching or listenning, ect	1
26764	4393	You @MONTH1 be thinking that anyone makes his/her own decision of what they read, watch, listen	2
26765	4393	Well, I do agree with that, but I do believe that some materials aren't rate it properly to age	3
26766	4393	I do think that some materials should be banned from people under age, some from kids, and some from everyone	4
26767	4393	You @MONTH1 be thinking that all of this is wrong and that there is nothing wrong with books, music, movies, ect., but in my opinion some materials are just offensive and not proper	5
26768	4393	I seen so many materials that I think are not proper for people under age to been looking at	6
26769	4393	In some movies, for example, the rating is just not right because some movies have so much violence or language	7
26770	4393	You might not think it's that big of a deal, of course, but I do	8
26771	4393	In my opinion, some materials are not too low in rating, and should not be for people under age	9
26772	4393	It's not surprising to me that kids are now yelling, hitting, and or acting like a rebels to their parents	10
26773	4393	Many of this things kids get it from books, music, movies, ect	11
26774	4393	This is many of the reasons some materials should be banned from kids	12
26775	4393	You ask yourself why	13
26776	4393	Well, first of all, kids are just learnning and they do everything they watch, see, or listen	14
26777	4393	I mean now kids don't even think about what their about to do	15
26778	4393	They just do, they don't care, they think it's okay	16
26779	4393	I think that parents should be alert to offensive materials in the shelves, and should say something about it so they banned them	17
26780	4393	Why banned some materials from everyone	18
26781	4393	Well, first of all, why do we even want to watch, see, or listen to things that are not right	19
26782	4393	You @MONTH1 be thinking that we just do it for fun and that it's enjoyable and nothing wrong with it	20
26783	4393	Well, you @MONTH1 be right but also wrong	21
26784	4393	I certainly do agree with you, we all watched things for fun and to enjoy them, but some things are just too out of this world for us	22
26785	4393	Why do people do crazy things now in these day	23
26786	4393	In my opinion, I think is because they mostly get it from books, music, movies, ect	24
26787	4393	I think that if a book shows very offensive things they should be banned from everyone no matter what	25
26788	4393	It's the right thing to do	26
26789	4393	If you don't want to see this world get more out of control than it already is	27
26790	4393	Well, we need to do something about all these materials that are offensive and banned them for good	28
26791	4393	We certainly don't want to see our kids yelling, hitting, or and actting like rebels to us	29
26792	4393	We don't want some crazy person coming to our hosue and do crazy things to us just because that's what they learn from those materials they had on the shelves	30
26793	4393	It's come to me that some materials should be banned from people under age, from kids, and some from everyone	31
26794	4394	A place fill of knowleged should be a place where you can find all the news that is making the world what it is today, a person should be able to find out things from the past also	0
26795	4394	A library has many different things found in it: books, magazines, movies, and some have music	1
26796	4394	The books range from encyclopedia's to @PERSON1, the varity of books and information is to the extreme	2
26797	4394	But then again with all the good things there always comes a bad side of the information	3
26798	4394	With all the profanity found in today's society you would not want a child seeing or hearing any of it while at a public library	4
26799	4394	Books are put into a library so that people have the chance to read them and become more knowledgable	5
26800	4394	The thought of a younger person going into the older, adult area is very upsetting but then again who's to say that that individual is not allowed to read an article or magazine that has more mature type's of information or language found in them	6
26801	4394	I feel that a person will see what they want to see and what they want to read, fact of the matter is they have the right to	7
26802	4394	Both, young and older people need to be educated in the worlds past history and the present news	8
26803	4394	One reason being to prevent things that happend in the past, happening again	9
26804	4394	Another reason is just so that they know what is going on around them and so that the individual is informed	10
26805	4394	Libraries should have banners or flaps up saying what is in a certain section of that specific area and people can make the decision to go over to those area's or not	11
26806	4394	Things that are found 'not right' in one's eyes @MONTH1 not seem so bad to anothers, it's all in personal preference	12
26807	4394	Things should still be out for the public to read or see	13
26808	4394	Making the choice to go into a library is an individuals decision	14
26809	4394	Fact is that the library is a place where a person should be able to get knowledge, no matter what type of information	15
26810	4394	A person should be able to get their information without the censorship of others.	16
26811	4395	I think that your parents should have to sign a peice of paper saying that it is ok or its not ok for the person to go to that side of the library	0
26812	4395	It is up to the parents and the way there kids will handle it	1
26813	4395	On one side of the library it would be more geared to a more mature audience no pornagraphic material of course but stuff that wouldnt be considered @NUM1	2
26814	4395	Kids fifteen and and older would understand	3
26815	4395	They might also have to have an adult with them	4
26816	4395	On the other side of the library it would be more of a childrens area with child storys	5
26817	4395	It would be targeted for more kids that are fourteen years and younger would like	6
26818	4395	There would have to be some one in the dividing line being shown the pass that says its ok or not	7
26819	4395	It would be a little difficult but it would satisfy both parties	8
26820	4395	It is up to the parent to decide if it is ok for there children to read a certain content of language and description	9
26821	4395	The child must be at least @NUM2 in order to get a pass from the parent though	10
26822	4395	I deffinately agree with Katherine Paterson eventually your kids will find out what all those things are	11
26823	4395	I would rather have my kids learn from a book and ask me then find it out on the streets where they could end up getting hurt or in trouble with the law	12
26824	4395	Or even going to a party and end up doing something that might kill them.	13
26825	4396	Do your rights end where mine begin	0
26826	4396	In such a diverse society, clashing opinions are unavoidable	1
26827	4396	Does that mean another human's rights should be abused because we don't agree with their practices, beliefs, or lifestyle	2
26828	4396	Everyone in this world is entitaled to their own opinion	3
26829	4396	What is wrong to some people @MONTH1 be right to others	4
26830	4396	For example, one family @MONTH1 view their children using curse words as offensive while another @MONTH1 see no problem	5
26831	4396	Diversity in beliefs does not mean that it is acceptable to censor society from cursing, religion, or violence disscused in published works	6
26832	4396	These concepts exist in the world and censoring them will not make them disappear	7
26833	4396	It is understood that there is both bad and good in the world, and pulling materials from the shelves of libraries will not change that	8
26834	4396	Censoring books, magazines, music, and other media is denying someone the ability so see ideas from all points of view	9
26835	4396	Whether or not you prevent a young child from seeing all perspecitves does not mean the bad and good do not exist	10
26836	4396	The saying 'one year older, one year wiser' can refer to the aknowledgement of different ideas and opinions	11
26837	4396	As a child grows, he will learn more about the materials that were censored	12
26838	4396	In some cases, such as in the classroom, your rights do end where mine begin	13
26839	4396	When it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity, everyone is able to choose what they pick from the shelf	14
26840	4396	The definition of 'offensive material' is simply a matter of opinion.	15
26841	4397	Do i think that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, ect., should be removed from the shelves.	0
26842	4397	No i do not think that some of these materials should be removed	1
26843	4397	Why	2
26844	4397	because nowadays kids read things such as gang violevce and things that dont involve school material but some kids find the books that they read interesting	3
26845	4397	Now, do i thing that the books should be not given to students who are very young of age	4
26846	4397	Yes, due to the fact that some books are a little above others age of reading	5
26847	4397	Sometimes you @MONTH1 have kids who are intrested in what others dont read	6
26848	4397	Books such as gang violence and drug abuse are some of those books in categories of which some cant read	7
26849	4397	I think that in this case kids under certain age shouldnt read these books because of some of the content that is involved in it	8
26850	4397	Kids find these books, movies and magazines interesting because many things that happen in the world today happen inside those books	9
26851	4397	Im not saying that its a good thing, but im saying that the things they read and see in those books and movies are things that some of us have seen in a everyday life	10
26852	4397	When I was younger, I went to a library in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 and whenever a kid would choose a big that wasn't for hiim/her they would always say 'you need your parents permission to check this book or magazine ect	11
26853	4397	out'	12
26854	4397	Once I actually noticed and got the point of why they would do this I thought that it was a good idea	13
26855	4397	I figure that all libraries should be like this considering that kids shouldnt read books that arent for them	14
26856	4397	This is also a good way to get kids from reading things that not age appropriate to finding something that is	15
26857	4397	So the main answer to this suggestion is, no, I dont think that these materials should be moved from shelves out of libraries	16
26858	4397	Why	17
26859	4397	because once they are gone then some kids might not even attend the library anymore because of the books that they find interesting are gone	18
26860	4397	So my suggestion is to not move them and let them stay on shelves just as any other book would	19
26861	4398	Do you believe that certain books, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelf in a library due to censorship	0
26862	4398	There are many times when you hear a parent tell their child not to look at that magazine because they don't want them to see the vulgar things on the inside	1
26863	4398	I've heard parents tell their children not to ever watch that movie because it'll show things that they don't need to be seeing	2
26864	4398	Almost every day we're put in situations like these, not knowing whether we should pick up the magazine or just leave it on the shelf	3
26865	4398	In my opinion, I believe that libraries should remove anything vulgar from the shelves	4
26866	4398	Kids are encouraged to go to the library as much as possible, but not if there is vulgar things on the shelves	5
26867	4398	Kids are told many times a week by their parents, teachers, and other adults to go the library	6
26868	4398	They can work on their homework, read a book, or do some studying for school	7
26869	4398	When they get distracted from finding the book they want with a book that has vulgar things in it, they're going to be curious	8
26870	4398	The main reason I disagree with having vulgar things on the shelves is because of young children	9
26871	4398	The last thing they need to be looking at is something that isn't appropriate for their age	10
26872	4398	It's hard for a child to turn down a movie or magazine they've never seen or looked at before	11
26873	4398	In most libraries the adult section is seperated from the childrens section	12
26874	4398	This doesn't mean that a child can't over hear something that the adults are listening to or watching	13
26875	4398	The childrens section is made for fairytale stories and kid movies, but when the adult section has things going on over there that aren't the most appropriate then kids can over hear	14
26876	4398	If children and adults are going to be in the same library then I think they should make it completely impossible for children to veer over there and see what's new on that side of the library	15
26877	4398	Another reason I think libraries should censor themselves more is because of teenages in the community	16
26878	4398	After school hours, a lot of teenagers in our community enjoy going to the library	17
26879	4398	If this is such a good environment for teenagers to be then why are they able to download bad music off of the internet	18
26880	4398	Some teenagers listen to bad music with cursing, vulgar language, and much more	19
26881	4398	Libraries should make it impossible for teenagers to do this	20
26882	4398	If they want to download bad music then they need to do it somewhere else where youngers can't get ahold of any of it	21
26883	4398	My last argument for this is a heads up for the parents	22
26884	4398	Parents should check out what stuff their kids are looking at when they go to the library	23
26885	4398	You might not think your child would look at something with vulgar things, but sometimes, they're curious	24
26886	4398	All children are and it's human nature to be curious	25
26887	4398	I, myself, would go with my child a few times just to see what's in the library and tell them not to take things off the shelves that look bad	26
26888	4398	Some libraries can't completely fix everything	27
26889	4398	They can't take every bad or vulgar thing off of the shelves	28
26890	4398	In the quote it says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.', I can think of books and magazines that I  would never want any child to look at, especially at a young age	29
26891	4398	Libraries need to be more interested in taking vulgar things off the shelves so that younger children cannot get ahold of	30
26892	4398	It's one thing for a child to see a book or magazine that isn't necessarily appropriate, but in a library it's a completely different story	31
26893	4399	There are certain books that no child should ever read but in some libraries they don't care whats on there shelf	0
26894	4399	They don't care if a little kid starts reading a book full of cusswords and other profanity	1
26895	4399	As long as hes reading thats all that matters to them	2
26896	4399	Even though in libraries there are kid sections that doesn't mean he can't walk over and grab an @CAPS1 book or what ever he can get his hands on	3
26897	4399	When I was little I was always in the library and it was never hard to get a book with bad language	4
26898	4399	We even thought it was funny when ever the book had cursewords in it cause we would just repeat	5
26899	4399	I remember in school even books the teacher would read to us had cursewords and we would all laugh at it, even the teacher thought it was funny	6
26900	4399	But if we ever repeated that word while not reading it we would get sent down to the office	7
26901	4399	Even though we thought it was ok to say just because we read it out of a book	8
26902	4399	I do agree that books with bad language should never be on the shelf to where a kid can grab it	9
26903	4399	I think its fine to have cursewords in books when there in junior high but elementary school is to early	10
26904	4399	Those books are meant for adults only cause some books sound better with cursewords in them	11
26905	4399	My parents thought it was wrong when I would bring home a book from the library and it would be full of cursewords or slang	12
26906	4399	But they would never say anything to the library cause they know that I will be hearing these words all the time when I get older	13
26907	4399	Those are all the reasons why I think books with curse words should not be handed out to little kids.	14
26908	4400	Billions of books float from shelf to shelf each day: fictional and nonfictional, horror and comedy	0
26909	4400	Writers reside in every part of the world composing works from complex life experiences to simple dreams	1
26910	4400	Being an author, who has the right to freedom of speech, story plots become to have endless combinations	2
26911	4400	Every reader seeks out a different style	3
26912	4400	Libraries contain books that tower to the ceilings, any kind, every kind	4
26913	4400	Books are divided into their individual sections according to truth, kind and cover, each category holding about four options	5
26914	4400	The necessity for censorship should never be an option	6
26915	4400	Writers compose for all sorts of people	7
26916	4400	For some to say what's 'right' or 'wrong' is not a legitamate reason for a piece of work to be removed from a shelf	8
26917	4400	If, perhaps, more books had ratings such as movies do, an @CAPS1 @NUM1 cubicle could be created instead of allowing young people to have access to such vulgarity	9
26918	4400	Taking away the enjoyment for some readers, however, is unethical	10
26919	4400	Whether pertaining to books, music, magazines, etc., censorship is unnecessary	11
26920	4400	Those who compose the entertainment should not have to worry about the content of their expression and/or interpretation	12
26921	4400	If the worry is concerning youth, parental guidance should be in affect	13
26922	4400	Resulting in cancellation can affect those who relate to the source so it's important to consider all options	14
26923	4400	To each, its own.	15
26924	4401	Censorship, or the ability to control what is seen or heard, is a term that is taken very differently from one person to the next	0
26925	4401	Music, if it is found offensive or inappropriate, can be consored or even banned from listening	1
26926	4401	Some magazines that are found at grocery stores, libraries, and sometimes even airports, have @ORGANIZATION1 covers on the front to visually censor the front page of the magazine	2
26927	4401	Movies are given ratings based on their level of explicit material, and when shown on basic cable, they sometimes can have either silenced words, or more appropriate words brought in to fit the dialougue in the movie	3
26928	4401	Books, although very rarely, have been banned from libraries and censored from the entire world	4
26929	4401	Some books have been previously censored, but became uncensored and brought back to libraries	5
26930	4401	In my opinion, censorship should not be based on a single person's view of the material, but rather on the viewpoint of the public	6
26931	4401	Growing up, my parents would watch carefully about what shows I watched, what music I listened to, or the types of magazines that i looked at	7
26932	4401	When I was growing up, I loved to watch professional wrestling	8
26933	4401	I loved to watch big scary guys as tall as seven feet hitting each other with steel chairs, crashing each other into tables, or throwing each other off of twenty-foot steel cages	9
26934	4401	My brother and I used to have a favorite wrestler that we would for every week, @PERSON1 @CAPS1 could freighten any other wrestler who stood in his way	10
26935	4401	My brother and I loved to watch @PERSON1 @CAPS1 compete every week for a chance at a world chamionship belt	11
26936	4401	As time passed, professional wrestling began to welcome in beautiful women into their business	12
26937	4401	These women would come out onto the ring with tight, shiny, lingerie on as they became eye-candy for the men who watched professional wrestling	13
26938	4401	One day, I'm watching two girls fighting in a match when my mom walks in	14
26939	4401	She takes one look at the half-naked girls fighting each other and turns off the @CAPS3 and declares that professional wrestling is too adult for me	15
26940	4401	Even though I was twelve at the time, I didn't want to get in an argument with my mom about how much I should be allowed to see	16
26941	4401	Censorship can be based on the ideas and viewpoints of the parents and guardians	17
26942	4401	I was in grade school when I fell in love with the show, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6.' @CAPS7 is a show about four boys who go on unintentional adventures to save their @CAPS4 @CAPS5	18
26943	4401	These four boys, who are all around eleven years old, use curse words that some adults would be afraid to use in every day life	19
26944	4401	Their behavior is very controversial and the show itself has been forced to ban a few of their episodes for safety reasons	20
26945	4401	One problem with @CAPS7 show was that my dad loved @CAPS7 show as well, and tried to get my mom to like the show	21
26946	4401	When my mom saw the show, she immediately banned me from watching it because of its explicit content	22
26947	4401	Now that I am older, I am able to make my own decisions about what I watch, but as a kid, my parents decided what was appropriate for me	23
26948	4401	I grew up listening to several different types of music	24
26949	4401	My brother listened to rap, alternative, and even songs that were in musicals because he was in show choir	25
26950	4401	My dad introduced me to classic rock, and my mom loved soft rock	26
26951	4401	Although I didn't necessarily like the music that my mom liked, I learned to love my dad's music and my brother's music	27
26952	4401	I loved to listen to music from artists like @ORGANIZATION4, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and so on	28
26953	4401	My musical tastes branched out into a variety of different genres	29
26954	4401	One day, I'm walking in the hallway when I hear some music coming from the living room	30
26955	4401	I go to see what is playing because it sounds unfamiliar	31
26956	4401	My dad and my brother told me to go into another room and not listen to the music	32
26957	4401	The song was by a band named @ORGANIZATION2	33
26958	4401	Even though it might seem unfair, censorship, given by the parents and guardians, is very necessary	34
26959	4401	Although some people might find a certain piece of material offensive, it doesn't mean that the entire world should be banned from the material itself	35
26960	4401	If that person wants to keep away from the material and keep their kids from seeing or listening to that material, they are able to do that	36
26961	4401	Censorship, given by the parents or guardians, is the best way to view censorship	37
26962	4401	Nothing should be banned from a library, music store, or any other place that sells these materials	38
26963	4401	Censorship is important, but the entire banning of a certain piece of material is unjust.	39
26964	4402	Yes there are many things today that have censorship,but should keep them out of our libraries.I think not.They should not be taken items out of the libraries do to censorships.Maybe if they are such a big concern they could do something else with them besides taking them out	0
26965	4402	I don't believe that they shouldn't take out censorship items out of the libraries just becase some people have a problem with it.Becase now a days you can go out in public and hear the same stuff they put in those censored movies,games,@CAPS1's,etc.I think that if they are even thinking about taking cencored product out of the library it should be up to the library and not the goverment	1
26966	4402	If censorship is such a big problem with people they dont have to check it out or look at it	2
26967	4402	So maybe if they are having problem's with parents becase there kids are checking he censored items out they should have a band.Like if you want to out a item with a censorship you either have to be @NUM1 or have a parent or guardin with you.But if it is still have a problem with it make it like tabacco products were you have to be @NUM1	3
26968	4402	Then if the libraries don't want to do that they could make a whole room just for censored items.They sould also put the room in a corner or in a less populated area of the library.There should also have to have a sign saying there are sencorhip items in that room and, maybe a sign saying @NUM1 and older	4
26969	4402	So there are many other was to dealing with censored items.Sence there are so many was to deal with them why take them out.We should not have to take censorship item out just becase some people do not like it.why punish every one becase of a few people	5
26970	4403	What would you do if a woman walked into a library and started throwing a tantraum about how inappropriate a book was, and she wanted it removed from the shelves	0
26971	4403	Would you just stare and wonder if she was crazy	1
26972	4403	Would you think that this is a public place, and everyone has their own opinions	2
26973	4403	I believe that even if someone thinks a material in a library is inappropriate, the material should not be taken off shelves	3
26974	4403	Many people actually believe materials in a library are too offensive or inappropriate	4
26975	4403	Unsurprisingly, libraries can't exactly do much about that except remove them from the shelves if absolutely nessessary	5
26976	4403	However, when you think about it, if everyone complained about a certain book being offensive, there would eventually be no more books	6
26977	4403	For example, I would not want my little brother reading @PERSON1 books because some chapters @MONTH1 contain a sex scene	7
26978	4403	However, my brother will eventually be older, and he'll be able to understand	8
26979	4403	If I would have gotten rid of that book, I wouldn't be letting other people enjoy it	9
26980	4403	If you were to get books removed that were about @CAPS1 because you were @CAPS2, many @CAPS3 wouldn't be happy to say the least	10
26981	4403	This could be about any subject matter, however	11
26982	4403	The more books that are removed from the library, the less people will know about the subject	12
26983	4403	Eventually, as I've said before, there will be no more books left	13
26984	4403	Everyone has their own opinion of what is appropriate or not, and everyone's views are different	14
26985	4403	The solution to this problem is simply to not remove the books	15
26986	4403	Sure, you might get complaints	16
26987	4403	But odds are, more people are unoffended rather than offended	17
26988	4403	Americans do have the right to fight for this, but with the majority being unoffended, it's a tough case to win	18
26989	4403	I believe all books would be fine left on shelves	19
26990	4403	If you take off one book, you might as well take off the rest	20
26991	4403	Next time you are picking out a book, and you find it offensive, think about how other people might want to read it	21
26992	4403	They might even need the information for a paper they're writing for a class	22
26993	4403	You never know who might need the information	23
26994	4403	Don't be selfish	24
26995	4403	keep the books on the library shelf.	25
26996	4404	Tuff @CAPS1 for a little @CAPS2      Censorship is a problem we are faced with today	0
26997	4404	I believe there are certain instances where censorship is necessary, but I also feel it must be kept in check	1
26998	4404	Thats why i have a great deal of reespect for organizations and industries that try and stop or put of censorship media untill your more mature and responsible enough to handle it	2
26999	4404	The most common categories where censorship is not all right in my world are, books and music	3
27000	4404	A lot of book are very well writen and fabulous to read, but in history or racial, and more cultural books they use words/terms that are offensive to me and a lot of other people to	4
27001	4404	Also, the main cause in thius is music	5
27002	4404	In today's society, nearly every person has an ipod and downloaded onto that ipod is music	6
27003	4404	Im not saying all music is terribly bad, but in most cases i hear about every word in the book and race topics	7
27004	4404	Rappers are setting bad examples for young adolecents like myself, who pose with guns and have marijuna and crack	8
27005	4404	Why do they do this	9
27006	4404	Just to mkae themselves more popular	10
27007	4404	That is hurting our education and making us think we shyould be criminals	11
27008	4404	I in my opinion enjoy magazines and tru informative facts from professional reporters	12
27009	4404	Tghe reporters are on the citizens side and trying to get the true facts out there for us the people	13
27010	4404	Maqgazines also, tell about annual celbrations and good things happening in the world	14
27011	4404	Whyere you can find out the scores of sports game and what the weather is going to be like	15
27012	4404	Last year, i remeber reading 'To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4'	16
27013	4404	It was so contraversial and talked about blackl slaves and whites treatinbg them like dirt	17
27014	4404	Also, about black never win a trial and there treated unfairly	18
27015	4404	I felt embaressed and i was the only african american in the class	19
27016	4404	It was akward	20
27017	4404	I felt like if we had a discussion people would talk badly about iot then remember i was in the room then theyd stop	21
27018	4404	What is the world going to do	22
27019	4404	Censorship covers an entire multi media spectrum of what is bad and good censorship	23
27020	4404	It is up to the right people to stand up for what is right and wrong for your children and young adolecents in the world	24
27021	4404	To help fight this cause	25
27022	4404	Bring down all that is bad	26
27023	4404	We can do it, we will fight	27
27024	4404	Like @PERSON1 says, 'dont hope for a better change or wish for a new world.' If you want change you need to make it happen and stand up for whats right and make a differnce in the world	28
27025	4405	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
27026	4405	The material should be removed if they offend their gender	1
27027	4405	Also, the material should be removed if it offend's their religion	2
27028	4405	Finally, it should be removed if it offend's their race	3
27029	4405	The material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's gender	4
27030	4405	First, the material can make a person feel unworthy	5
27031	4405	Second, the material can cause an large altercation between the author and the person who is being offended and maybe others	6
27032	4405	Third, the material can also harm someone by them picking up the book and reading the text	7
27033	4405	Also, the material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's religion	8
27034	4405	This can cause someone to hate every other person with the same religion as the writer, song writer, actor, and/or director	9
27035	4405	Second, the library should be about education, fun, and interesting contents not by offending someones religion	10
27036	4405	Finally, this can cause a person or people to act as terrostist from this offensive content	11
27037	4405	The material also should be removed if it is offending someones race	12
27038	4405	First, the material @MONTH1 call the race of the person that is reading, listening or watching a name that's very offensive name( not directly but in general)	13
27039	4405	Second the material can speak of the race as if was bad	14
27040	4405	Last, the material can influence other kids to disrespect that race and not like people of that race	15
27041	4405	The material that is offensive to anyones gender,religion, and/or race should be removed from the shelves of a library	16
27042	4405	the library is a place where everyone can read, listen, or watch about something that is interesting not to offend other people in all ways.	17
27043	4406	Often we go to the library searching for a good book or magazine to read without actually knowing what books are available	0
27044	4406	In order to find a book that interests you, you have to explore by picking up the book and looking at the cover and reading its background	1
27045	4406	Sometimes we come across a book or magazine that is innapropriete for children, and wonder why that book is still on the shelf for anyone to pick up	2
27046	4406	I believe materials that are offensive to some people should be permitted from the public library	3
27047	4406	To begin, the books selected to advertise on the shelves of a library are not restricted for a certain age level	4
27048	4406	Libraries are broken up into different sections on where to find a genre, but a young child @MONTH1 not be aware	5
27049	4406	I believe they're certain materials found in a library that should not be put out for the public	6
27050	4406	Perhaps you have a five year old child pick up a book about sex and drugs, this could lead the child to learn things they shouldn't know until they are older	7
27051	4406	To continue, offensive books should not be put into libraries because they give that library a bad reputation	8
27052	4406	If someone were to come from out of town and the first thing they seen on the shelves of a library was a book with a naked body or drugs, they would immediately be taken back	9
27053	4406	Offensive types of books can include books you wouldn't want a first grader to see and also books about racial or religion	10
27054	4406	Certain people would take offense to a book that was against what they believed in	11
27055	4406	This could result in a huge confrontation	12
27056	4406	Lastly, offensive books can include books about someone's opinion on a certain topic	13
27057	4406	If someone against the writer's opinion started to read the book, they would automatically be offended by what the writer was saying	14
27058	4406	There is never an agreement when two people have a different look on something	15
27059	4406	To conclude, although some books are offensive to some people and not to others, we have to be aware of what @MONTH1 cause problems to certain people	16
27060	4406	I believe any book open about opinion, and books that would be 'x-rated' should not be kept in a public library	17
27061	4406	We could easily solve this problem by making a seperate place to hold these books so people will not take offense to it.	18
27062	4407	What do you think about them taking books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive	0
27063	4407	Everyone has a different look on it	1
27064	4407	It is an important thing to think about	2
27065	4407	Just stop and think do you want your child looking at that when you are not around	3
27066	4407	Many would say no, because they are to young to know about stuff that shows to much and other reasons also.Taking all the ones found offensive off the shelves would be the best idea for the case of young teens, and childern	4
27067	4407	I believe that they should be taking off the shelves, and you have to be @NUM1 or older to buy them in many reason	5
27068	4407	The biggest reason I think they should is, kids under the age of @NUM1 want to look cool like the older teenagers, but really don't need to see that	6
27069	4407	With the young teenager think they need to do things like the stuff in music, movies, to be cool and think if they do that they @MONTH1 look cool	7
27070	4407	Young teenager don't think about what they are doing, and just think it ok because the older ones are doing it and they see it	8
27071	4407	With magazines, and movies, and music they need to be of age to buy	9
27072	4407	One big reason to believe that they should be taking off the shelves is because, a lot of kids and young teens thinks they can go in anywhere and look at things that are found offensive	10
27073	4407	There are a lot of different types, and you have to be of age to go into some places.With believing that they should take them off the shelves, it gives the @CAPS1 a fill free about your child to look at things without think about the offensive ones	11
27074	4407	I hope with reading my persuasive essay, I hope i relate to someone about the books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive can relize what i'm talking about with young teens around the ages of @NUM3 and if you take your child with you and they see something like that	12
27075	4407	With the a stuff  I gave you it helps you see the out look on stuff that is offensive on the shelves	13
27076	4408	Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc	0
27077	4408	be removed from libraries if they are found offensive	1
27078	4408	My opinion on this is no	2
27079	4408	In this essay I will explain my opinion and hopefully change other peoples opinions	3
27080	4408	I will also explain how the past has an effect on present day	4
27081	4408	In some cases books, music, movies, magazines, etc	5
27082	4408	@MONTH1 offend any race or a sertain sex, but that is what happened in the history of the @LOCATION1	6
27083	4408	Some @MONTH1 be very offensive but it only shows a past, others @MONTH1 just be plain out racist or sexist	7
27084	4408	Those that show the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 history are an education sorce so we can learn from mistakes	8
27085	4408	Here is exactly why I state this opinion, taking this material off shelves is like taking someones freedom of speach away	9
27086	4408	I hate when I here music that disrespects women but im not going to try and get it taken away because it might just be expressing how the artist of the song loved someone or how history for their family @MONTH1 have been	10
27087	4408	In conclusion, I believe this material should not be taken off the shelves	11
27088	4408	After explaining my opinion think about what is offensive or just someone expressing a past memory	12
27089	4408	If a past was offensive something tody might be offensive, as I was told earlier in my life treat others as you want to be treated	13
27090	4408	I hope i caught attention and changed some opinions because alot of offence today has resulted from the past	14
27091	4409	Censorship in libraries	0
27092	4409	A yes or a No	1
27093	4409	I believe that there should not be censorship in libraries	2
27094	4409	There are not many things 'offensive' or 'harmful' in most libraries in @LOCATION1	3
27095	4409	I dont see who would come up with such an abserd idea	4
27096	4409	To me there are just way to many ways for people to get offended	5
27097	4409	@MONTH1 I remind you that we almost changed our plege to the flag of our country by getting rid of the word 'god' all because some people dont believe in god	6
27098	4409	Now we are suppose to get rid of good books just because they are child friendly?	7
27099	4409	Think about all the amazing books, movies and magazines that would have to be removed from our libraries just because one person says, 'I find this book offensive' or says, 'I dont think this book is apporaite for my child.' @CAPS1 about the people that do like that book and now wont be able to read it anymore all beacuse of that one person	8
27100	4409	There are sections in libraries for a reason	9
27101	4409	Just put the naughty books in the eight-teen year or older section so younger kids dont see them	10
27102	4409	The people who want to get rid of so called dangerous books to childern make libraries sound like there porngrapic shops	11
27103	4409	Most libraries are not filled with horrible bad books that will cause there child to be mentaly scared forever	12
27104	4409	Hell there are really that mant books out there anyways	13
27105	4409	Now sometimes a bad book @MONTH1 end up in the kids section but that dose not mean we have to remove that book forever form all the other people who want to read that book	14
27106	4409	All librarie workers just have to make sure to put all books in there rightfull spots and nothing bad will happen	15
27107	4409	The bad books will be in the adult section and the child frendily books will be in another	16
27108	4409	Have some libabrie workers watching the area and make aure little kids dont go in the libabrie	17
27109	4409	This will prevent childern from seeing the bad books because they will be in the adult section	18
27110	4409	In conclusion I answer this question by saying no	19
27111	4409	There are just way to many good books that would have to be gone forever	20
27112	4410	I belive that all literature of any kind is useful even though it could be offensive	0
27113	4410	If society plans on taking something off the shelf because it offends a race or gender, than many life-lesson books, movies, magazines, music, etc., would be removed from the shelves	1
27114	4410	Things such as books or movies are there to take people to different worlds, to help them learn knowledge, to teach them lessons that the real world @MONTH1 not teach them	2
27115	4410	If materials are taken off the shelf in fear of offending someone, then not very many things will be left just like Katherine Paterson says in her quote	3
27116	4410	If certian literature were not around anymore then it definitly would not be the same as it is now	4
27117	4410	Literature are there for us, they teach us, and if if one @CAPS1 was taken away, it would start a riot	5
27118	4410	Books are always there for us, when we are bored, lonely, or just want to escape reality	6
27119	4410	Imagine if you we not able to read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for society	7
27120	4410	If all books had to be appropriate for every age, it would take all the interesting out of everything	8
27121	4410	Whether it is a novel or a regular encyclopedia, all books would be dulled down to exceed the needs of our 'non offending' society	9
27122	4410	Lots of music would lose it's luster and magazines would not be able to gossip about the 'hottest new things.'  Movies would get too boring to watch and many things in society would fall apart	10
27123	4410	Books, documentaries, magazines, are there to help people learn, either if its a lesson about what not to do while your young, such as smoking, if books about smoking were taken away because it offended the part of society that chose to smoke then how would any of the teens today know not to start smoking	11
27124	4410	Novels are usually fiction, but the characters come to life to readers	12
27125	4410	They have problems just life people of the real world even though they @MONTH1 not be real themsleves, so if one reads that book, the way that character handles the situation could help a real life person decide on what they should do about there problem	13
27126	4410	Important history books of movies could be taken away becaus it 'offends' @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to have students learn about slaves	14
27127	4410	If one @CAPS1 was taken from the shelf because of offending someone then more and more materials would be taken away form society	15
27128	4410	What good does that do anyone	16
27129	4410	It leaves many students uneducated about many things that they need to be educated about	17
27130	4410	It would disrupt the order in libraries if books were being removed because of aproppriateness	18
27131	4410	If books were being judged on appropriateness then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now	19
27132	4410	No good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries	20
27133	4410	Books, movies, magazines, music, it is all too important to society, it keep us company, it teaches us, is makes life easier at times when the world wants to kick you while you are down	21
27134	4410	If one person decided that a book was not appropriate then they can chose not to read it, but they should not decide to help remove that book from the shelves of libraries	22
27135	4410	They would start a landslide of trouble that would effect everyone in the @LOCATION1 and maybe even across the globe	23
27136	4410	Information of any kind is a good @CAPS1 no matter the content of it	24
27137	4410	So removing any sort of material from our libraries is a horrible idea.	25
27138	4411	The content in todays materials are not always subtible for young children	0
27139	4411	Information now distributed in the media and other networks can be harmful for some young children to read or be surrounded by, including video games	1
27140	4411	By growing up in a violent enviornment, children observe and have the greater chance at becoming violent	2
27141	4411	The continuence of censorship in todays materials are a necessity to the well being of the children in todays society	3
27142	4411	In video games there are ratings that help explain wat is subtible for each age throughout childhood and adolesence	4
27143	4411	Movies are also the same, making it harder for younger children to see certain movies	5
27144	4411	Books and magazines are not as well protected although they should be	6
27145	4411	Age and maturity plays a huge role in whether or not a child should be aloud to read and be introduced to specific material	7
27146	4411	Violence is a major trend in video games in todays world, and some of the influence it brings on children is unecessary and eventually detrimental to their well being	8
27147	4411	The reason ratings should be changed is because children obsorb their enviornment and become what they see, so if they are introduced to violent behavior they have a greater chance in becoming violent children	9
27148	4411	In libraries there are sections for every age group, specific genre of books, fiction, and non fiction	10
27149	4411	But some of the explicit material in books and magazines should also be censored before they are distributed on shelves and allowed available for young teenagers and children	11
27150	4411	As a part of the community libraries should take apart in the well being of the children and not expose them to information earlier than necessary	12
27151	4411	Throughout my own experience, I have seen children grow up too fast when exposed to certain knowledge	13
27152	4411	Especially in todays music, radios do a good job in editing content in songs, by puting parental advisory on certain cd's, but this still does not stop them from buying the material	14
27153	4411	In games including, @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, @NUM1, etc	15
27154	4411	teens are now becoming accostumed to this type of behavior, that is not safe nor condusive for children	16
27155	4411	By censoring certain material it disallows the continuence of bad behavior amongst our youth today	17
27156	4412	READ WITH @CAPS1     I do not believe that libraries carry the responsibilty to censor reading materials	0
27157	4412	When a person enters a library, they immediately must infer that, because libraries are place in which knowledge is accumulated, that some of that information they find @MONTH1 not cooincide with what they believe	1
27158	4412	If a person believes a book is offensive, they can just as easily put it down as they had picked it up	2
27159	4412	Obviously, however, there are certain exceptions	3
27160	4412	Childrens' sections, of course, should be limited to those intended for younger readers	4
27161	4412	Putting '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' into a childrens' section hardly seems logical	5
27162	4412	just as much as putting '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' into the adults section	6
27163	4412	In addition, author @PERSON1 once stated that if she was able to ban a book from a library, the same right would have to be given to all other patrons as well	7
27164	4412	Thus leading to all the books in a library being unable to be read	8
27165	4412	the knowledge contained within them unknown	9
27166	4412	There are, as with any ordinance, exceptions	10
27167	4412	For example, if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences, censorship should hardly be considered a crime	11
27168	4412	The exclusion of inappropriate items, such as permisquous reading material, keeps childeren from formulating ideas about concepts they @MONTH1 not be able to fully understand	12
27169	4412	With all these things considered, banning books from a library hardly seems to be the best course of action	13
27170	4412	A library should be a place of enlightenment	14
27171	4412	Opposing ideas should be presented	15
27172	4412	Leaving the readers to formulate their own decisions about what they believe	16
27173	4412	Because books are like atoms	17
27174	4412	When two opposing types collide, a burst of energy is released.	18
27175	4413	A @CAPS1 is a place for people of all ages to come and get a book, magazine, music, movies and much more	0
27176	4413	Libraries are a key essential to learning and helping those with reading skills	1
27177	4413	Studies show that reading will make you much smarter and able to understand and comprehend well	2
27178	4413	However, in my opinion, offensive reading, viewing or listening material does not belong in libraries, to some extent	3
27179	4413	As I stated earlier, libraries are a place of learning and for developing skills	4
27180	4413	Books that are for 'adults' can be found in adult type stores or even at a regular local book store	5
27181	4413	Parents bring their children to the @CAPS1 to support their reading ability and to advance it	6
27182	4413	They don't want to have to worry about making sure their kids are not looking at anything bad	7
27183	4413	A few years back, I herd about a teenage boy that would go into the @CAPS1 about once a week to look for movies that this parnents would not approve of	8
27184	4413	Later on that boy was caught and punished	9
27185	4413	If those kinds of movies were not there in the first place, his parents would not of had to worry about it	10
27186	4413	Almost everywhere you go and everything to see and hear has some type of wrong background to it	11
27187	4413	Parents should feel okay and worry-free when it comes to letting their kids do something as simple as going to the @CAPS1	12
27188	4413	This problem can be easily fixed with removing that issue	13
27189	4413	I strongly believe that @CAPS1 material should be censored in the way that those who should not see it, can not see it	14
27190	4413	On the other hand, material such as religious or cultural learning items that people find offensive should not be taken off the shelves	15
27191	4413	Religious and cultural books, music, movies, and/or magazines are for those to learn	16
27192	4413	Form what I have seen, someone @MONTH1 want, for example, a book about @CAPS2 taken off the shelf because they are @CAPS3 and might not support their religious ways	17
27193	4413	I find this wrong because it is a free country that includes freedom of religion and they can't be denied informing others about that religion	18
27194	4413	Libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed	19
27195	4413	Everyone likes to sit in the @CAPS1 for hours and soak in a good novel	20
27196	4413	Material that is found offensive does not belong their, unless it is for real educational learning.	21
27197	4414	The subject of censorship in libraries has been brought upon many times	0
27198	4414	Censorship is a rule prohibiting the view of a book, music, movies, magazines, etc	1
27199	4414	This censorship is because of it's rating or the content in it is inapropriate for some viewers/readers	2
27200	4414	Of course, many people have their own opinions about this censorship in libraries, as do I	3
27201	4414	I believe that censorship is a good idea in some cases	4
27202	4414	These cases being music, or movies	5
27203	4414	However, I don't believe censorship is a good idea in books	6
27204	4414	Children all over the world read books and as time goes on, our children are becoming more and more advanced and read on higher levels	7
27205	4414	This is where censorship comes into play	8
27206	4414	Libraries want to censor higher reading level books because these books include profanity, violence, sex, drugs, and any other aspect of adultry	9
27207	4414	I disagree with the censorship of these books because this is basically telling our children that they can't challenge themselves or they can't learn about certain things because of their age	10
27208	4414	These books, in my opinion, can only help them	11
27209	4414	These books will help them learn about society, what's wrong and what's right, and will help them, grow as they get older	12
27210	4414	The higher reading level books help them understand words better, and also help them learn about literature and past times	13
27211	4414	When I was in middle school, I was not an advanced reader by any means, but I did like to read occasionally	14
27212	4414	One day, I went to the library in search of a challenging book	15
27213	4414	The book I found was a book called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' by @PERSON1	16
27214	4414	This book was a fictional story taking place during the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3	17
27215	4414	As I put in my pin number to check out the book at the front desk, the librarian informed me that I couldn't check out the book because it was a young adult book, meaning 'too advanced' for me	18
27216	4414	She said I needed parent consent before I was able to check it out	19
27217	4414	That night, I asked my parents about it and asked if I could read it	20
27218	4414	They said yes, mostly because they were so thrilled that I even wanted to read a book so challenging	21
27219	4414	The next day I got a note from home informing the librarian that I could read the book	22
27220	4414	I was so thrilled when I was finally able to check out the book and read it	23
27221	4414	From my experience with the library censorship, I think that the best route to take is that if there is a parent/guardian who is over @NUM1, and they approve of the checking out of the book/magazine or whatever it @MONTH1 be, then the child or student is allowed to check out said book/magazine etc	24
27222	4414	In conclusion, the censorship of books, magazines, etc	25
27223	4414	is an overall mediocre idea, with some exceptions	26
27224	4414	The rule of parent/guardian consent is the best route to take in my opinion.Of course, this subject will be argued for many years to come and many people will have their own opinions	27
27225	4414	Each side of the argument has valid points, but I think that it is imparative that we keep censorship out of books and keep our children learning and reading at their highest ability, no matter what the reading level is.	28
27226	4415	Should certain materials in libraries be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	0
27227	4415	I do not think books or any other materials should be taken off the shelves for some people	1
27228	4415	There are many reasons that the books should stay on the shelves	2
27229	4415	I am going to tell you all of the reasons I think the books should stay on the shelves	3
27230	4415	One reason I think the books should stay on the shelves is because some people might need the books for a school project	4
27231	4415	For example, a student could have a project over @CAPS1	5
27232	4415	A book on @CAPS1 could offend many people	6
27233	4415	Just because it offends some people does not mean it should be taken off the shelf because other people might need that book	7
27234	4415	Someone might need a certain book for a project	8
27235	4415	If the one book they need is taken off a shelf because it offended someone they could fail a class	9
27236	4415	That is one reason I think the books should stay on the shelves	10
27237	4415	Another reason I think they should stay on the shelves it's their opinion if the book offends them	11
27238	4415	Just because they don't like the book and it offends them doesn't mean other people do not want to read it	12
27239	4415	Why would you take a book off of a shelf because it offends one or a couple people	13
27240	4415	There could be many more people who want to check out that book and read it	14
27241	4415	If a book offends you just dont look at it	15
27242	4415	Why would you look at something that offends you	16
27243	4415	I don't understand why libraries would have to removed a book from the shelf just because it offends someone	17
27244	4415	Especially, when that person could just ignore the book and pay no attention to it	18
27245	4415	That is my last reason my opinion is what it is	19
27246	4415	So after reading this I hope you understand why my opinion is what it is	20
27247	4415	There is no point in taking books off the shelves	21
27248	4415	People need them for research and projects	22
27249	4415	It is someones opinion if they do not like what the book is about and if it offends them	23
27250	4415	For example, if i didn't like something on a menu at a resteraunt they are not going to take it off the menu for me	24
27251	4415	My last reason the books should stay on the shelves is the people can just ignore the books and not look at them that would be easier than taking books off the shelves	25
27252	4415	THE @CAPS3	26
27253	4416	Is @CAPS1 Right	0
27254	4416	Is @CAPS1 right to have censorship in libraries	1
27255	4416	This question could be answered in two very different opinions	2
27256	4416	Some people @MONTH1 want all censorship items out of public areas	3
27257	4416	On the other hand, there are people that @MONTH1 like to read this type of material	4
27258	4416	This is a very opinionated topic	5
27259	4416	In my opinion, libraries are places I go to find a book to read, research, listen to music, rent movies, or relax while looking at a magazine	6
27260	4416	Libraries are puble areas and not everyone is going to agree	7
27261	4416	Everyone has their own favorite book or genre	8
27262	4416	I believe @CAPS1 is unjustiful to take away censorship in libraries because this @MONTH1 be ones favorite genre	9
27263	4416	Why do libraries need to limit their choice while noone else does	10
27264	4416	For example, many parents would love if all clothes stores would ban holes in jeans because they are to revealing	11
27265	4416	The stores don't	12
27266	4416	They do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans	13
27267	4416	American @CAPS2 is not going to band capris just because I do not like them	14
27268	4416	There are different favorites, likes, dislikes, and opinions	15
27269	4416	A great resolution for this dissagreement is catorigizing	16
27270	4416	By putting all of the censorshiped books, movies, magazines, and music in one area, @CAPS1 will decrease arguments on this topic because all of the people that like censorship in libraries will be together in their area	17
27271	4416	Where as the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around @CAPS1	18
27272	4416	This is a quick and easy fix	19
27273	4416	There is no reason to take away ones favorite genre because someone doesn't like @CAPS1	20
27274	4416	If this is true then our world will have nothing because not everyone likes one certain thing	21
27275	4416	For instance, I do not like blue aeropostale shirts	22
27276	4416	Pink are my favorite	23
27277	4416	My friend @CAPS3 likes the blue shirts and hates the pink shirts	24
27278	4416	We both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like	25
27279	4416	This is nonbenifical for either of us because now the one we do not like is got but so is the one we do like	26
27280	4416	This is nonsense	27
27281	4416	There will be nothing left in the store	28
27282	4416	Pople in charge can easily sort material at a store or a library to make @CAPS1 fit the communities likings	29
27283	4416	Getting rid of material is not the answer	30
27284	4416	Catorigizing is the fix that needs to be put into action immediatly	31
27285	4417	In our society today there is an enormous amount of exposure to materials that many adults didn't have when they were a child	0
27286	4417	Young children today see drugs, alcohol, sex, and teen pregnancy portrayed as things a normal child's everyday life consists of	1
27287	4417	Certain television shows, books, and even some popular songs condone these behaviors that many @CAPS1 are opposed to	2
27288	4417	While libraries @MONTH1 seem to be the most unusual place to have access to these materials, many young children can checkout books that are simply not appropriate for their age	3
27289	4417	Censorship of materials, such as books, movies, and music, that are found offensive or inappropriate are a way to teach young children that life isn't all about what the media portrayes it to be	4
27290	4417	One very important reason to allow censorship of materials in libraries is that you might not know what type of book you're looking at	5
27291	4417	Many children, and adults too, walk into the library and look among the books until they see a cover or a title that grabs their attention	6
27292	4417	While most of the books in a library are age appropriate a child can still grab a book that isn't something they should be reading	7
27293	4417	There are mass amounts of influential materials from the media and also from peers that a child is subject to	8
27294	4417	Censorship in a library will make it a safer place for children to go and pick up any book in the proper section for them and will also allow the @CAPS1 to not have to worry about what their child has selected	9
27295	4417	As author Katherine Paterson so rightly said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 should never have to worry about what their child can get ahold of in a public library	10
27296	4417	A second reason to allow censorship in libraries is that video stores already have censorship in their shops, along with ratings on all their movies and video games	11
27297	4417	Most video stores have a seperate section of movies that are deemed to have 'adult content' in them	12
27298	4417	A minor cannot walk into a movie store and go to the section of movies deemed for adults, or someone over the age of eighteen	13
27299	4417	A minor can't rent an @CAPS2-rated movie without proving that they are seventeen, or they have an adult to rent it for them	14
27300	4417	The same thing occurs with video games, for example a video game with a rating of @CAPS3, or mature, cannot be rented or bought by anyone under the age of eighteen	15
27301	4417	@CAPS5 censorship should be applied to libraries	16
27302	4417	Having seperate sections based on adult content allow movies and books to be set in a seperate location so that no child can possibly rent something that they have no intention of watching or reading	17
27303	4417	@CAPS5 type of censorship also allows for a parent to choose if their child can see it	18
27304	4417	An example of @CAPS5 would be for a sixteen year old boy	19
27305	4417	While he cannot go and rent the @CAPS2-rated movie, if his @CAPS1 deem it acceptable for him to see, then they can rent it for him	20
27306	4417	@CAPS5 gives the parent control of what their child sees, instead of the child having full control	21
27307	4417	@CAPS5 same type of censorship that video stores have is a perfect way to place censorship in a library	22
27308	4417	Perhaps the most important reason for censorship in libraries is the early exposure the materials give to the children	23
27309	4417	Many young children have been watching television shows or hearing things on the news that make it seem acceptable in our society to drink at parties when you're not of age, do illegal drugs for the feeling, and have sex at an extremely young age because it's what 'everyone's doing.' @CAPS5 is a very risky path to let the young children in our society take	24
27310	4417	Allowing our culture to become @CAPS5 way can lead to various sorts of problems, as we have seen all to well	25
27311	4417	Many young kids, some as young as fourteen or fifteen years old, go to parties and drink	26
27312	4417	When it comes to getting a ride home they go with their seventeen-year-old friend who has a license, and who has also been drinking at the party	27
27313	4417	Now hopefully the story ends that all of the children make it home safely, but that is not how it works in many cases	28
27314	4417	There have been so many drunk driving crashes recently in our nation with children who should not have even been drinking	29
27315	4417	@CAPS5 ties back to censorship because of the way these kids were pressured into drinking	30
27316	4417	Many adults in the society blame it on peer pressure	31
27317	4417	but where do the peers get the idea that @CAPS5 is acceptable	32
27318	4417	These ideas come from the influences that the society's children are susceptable to	33
27319	4417	Censorship in libraries is one way of restricting the ideas children are exposed to, and hopefully allowing them lead safer and healtheir lives	34
27320	4417	While there are so many other factors in the exposure to children of these materials, stopping the exposure in libraries is one way of eradicating early exposure	35
27321	4417	Young children in today's society and culture are exposed to excessive amounts of inappropriate materials	36
27322	4417	These three factors, the inability to know what you might be checking out at the library, the fact that video stores already have censorship, and the unecessary exposure to young children, all lead to the need for censorship in libraries	37
27323	4417	Today's society is all about the freedom to allow anything to happen than is acceptable	38
27324	4417	While some @MONTH1 see these books or movies as their own freedom to speech the truth is that it is harming the society, hence the need for censorship in libraries and other places where children have access to movies, books, magazines, music, and video games	39
27325	4417	Removing the offensive books, magazines, and movies from shelves in libraries around the country will lead to a safer culture for children to grow up in, and a society where things such as drugs, alcohol, and sex aren't condoned near as often	40
27326	4418	Library books offensive	0
27327	4418	The right to remove a book or not isn't up to us ,people, per our opinions	1
27328	4418	If someone has an issue with the book	2
27329	4418	next time don't get it	3
27330	4418	I know that we shouldn't have the right to remove books from the librarys	4
27331	4418	It's not up to us to make that choice	5
27332	4418	I know people sometimes find somethings wrong or inappropriate in a book at the librarys', but if it wasn't to your liking don't read the rest of it or refer it to a friend	6
27333	4418	I have had problems with this before	7
27334	4418	I went to check out a book and my mom said that she didn't like the topic that it was about: honestly its her opinion	8
27335	4418	A person should have a right to his/her opinions but it shouldn't affect someone elses	9
27336	4418	One person @MONTH1 really like the book and someone else @MONTH1 hate it, obviously their are people out there who enjoy that type of book so there isn't a really good reason to get rid of it	10
27337	4418	The only person who should have a say in getting rid of a book would have to be the librarian	11
27338	4418	That person knows what is acceptable and what isn't for the library	12
27339	4418	If it includes something graphic or racist, you can talk to them about it in a clam conversation, because they maybe a librarian but they dont read every single book that is in the library	13
27340	4418	Some items can be offensive to some but not others	14
27341	4418	The library is there for knowledge and entertainment	15
27342	4418	We can have opinions on matters and discuss them appropriately without causing a big ordeal  because their could be reasons why things are where they are	16
27343	4418	You need to leave the choice up to the person who is educated on the matter/ who is in charge of the library	17
27344	4419	To whom it @MONTH1 concern,     Censorship is an issue that has plagued our society for centuries	0
27345	4419	It is not only unnecessary, but unconstitutional	1
27346	4419	As @CAPS1, we have certain @ORGANIZATION1 that we are guarenteed by the documents that keep our society out of anarchy	2
27347	4419	If the right to pick what liturature to read, watch, or listen to is taken away, where will that put our country	3
27348	4419	Censorship should by no means be allowed in our country today	4
27349	4419	In the @CAPS2, the @CAPS3, and the @ORGANIZATION1, we are given certain @ORGANIZATION1	5
27350	4419	Some of these @ORGANIZATION1, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press, have already been contricted, which is 'wrong' in the eyes of the government, but nevertheless, it is taking place	6
27351	4419	We @MONTH1 not have 'lost' these @ORGANIZATION1, but they have definitely been constricted	7
27352	4419	Why should the government be able to tell us what to read	8
27353	4419	If censorship is allowed, what is to come is frightening	9
27354	4419	If our government, which is supposed to be 'for the people' tells us what we can read and not read, what is going to stop them from telling us what to wear, drink, or even eat	10
27355	4419	Censorship in libraries is one of our biggest issues	11
27356	4419	There are countless examples on why censorship of written liturature should not be allowed	12
27357	4419	For instance, if a college student is writting a research paper about the effects of rape on a child, but the government sees rape as 'too graphic', what is this student to do	13
27358	4419	He or she should be given the right to use what materials are necessary to write a fully-informed paper	14
27359	4419	But by censoring our libraries, and taking books out, the government is hindering the education of it's countries youth	15
27360	4419	Some @CAPS4 classics are also being speculated against	16
27361	4419	The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2 has been known as a classic since it was written	17
27362	4419	It is used in classrooms everywhere around the country for education	18
27363	4419	But recently, the availability of the book has been questioned	19
27364	4419	Throughout the novel, the 'n-word' is used, but never as an insult	20
27365	4419	During the time-period of its writing, this word was more common, and had a much less severe meaning than it does in modern day societies	21
27366	4419	But because time has changed it's meaning, it is being removed from libraries and curriculums across the country	22
27367	4419	This is unlawful censorship	23
27368	4419	One of the greatest books of our time, an @CAPS4 classic, is being removed from the lives of our youth because of 'racy language'	24
27369	4419	Censorship is not only taking place in written liturature	25
27370	4419	Movies and music are also under the magnifying glass of censorship	26
27371	4419	Movies are rated for a reason, to give the viewers an age group for which the movie is appropriate	27
27372	4419	This is helpful to parents to be able to self-censor their children	28
27373	4419	But it is not up the the government to be able to choose what a specific child is able to view	29
27374	4419	It is a parents right to be able to expose or not expose their child to whatever they see fit, not that of our country's lawmakers	30
27375	4419	Music is one of the biggest part of our society today	31
27376	4419	With the invention of iPods and @NUM1 devices, music has become much more common, and portable	32
27377	4419	Censorship is becoming more severe with the change of music style	33
27378	4419	The music styles of modern teenagers greatly differs from that of their grandparents	34
27379	4419	Almost nothing is seen as unacceptable by many of today's rappers, as displayed in their choice of lyrics	35
27380	4419	The music business is taking quite a beating for what has become the most popular	36
27381	4419	With the most common themes of sex, drugs, and money, it @MONTH1 seem offensive to some citizens, but others @MONTH1 just shrug it off as a normalcy	37
27382	4419	So how can someone say 'No, you @MONTH1 not listen to that,'	38
27383	4419	This should not be allowed, yet it is	39
27384	4419	How can one person, or a group of people decide what is acceptable and what is not	40
27385	4419	They cannot	41
27386	4419	Censorship is morally wrong, as well as lawfully wrong	42
27387	4419	Taking the media from its citizens, such as books, movies, and music, is unconstitutional	43
27388	4419	What would our forefathers think of what censorship has become	44
27389	4419	Before you pull that 'unacceptable' book off the shelf, remember the @ORGANIZATION1 of our great countries citizens, and the @ORGANIZATION1 of individuals like yourself	45
27390	4419	Sincerely,                                             @PERSON1	46
27391	4420	It is a prominent question of debate whether or not certain materials in libraries such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
27392	4420	Although there are materials that @MONTH1 me harmful to children, freedom of information is far more importiant than protection because censorship is unconstitutional, prevents readers from an impartial perspective, and in some cases hides pressing societal issues that are deemed improper by the censors	1
27393	4420	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 states that freedom of speech, religion and the press shall not be denied or abridged	2
27394	4420	In more general terms, the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 grants freedom of expression	3
27395	4420	Censorship is effectively unconstitutional	4
27396	4420	It prevents freedom of expression	5
27397	4420	Students and scholars alike cannot access all information that should be avaliable to them if not for censorship	6
27398	4420	Although private business and libraries can be permitted to censor because they have their own contracts that permit this, public libraries and schools are effectively breaching the constitution when they censor	7
27399	4420	Censorship prevents a whole and complete perspective on an issue	8
27400	4420	Censors often ban particular books because of personal views of alleged 'immorality.' @CAPS5 a clear and complete access to all information, how can one make any valid conclusion about anything	9
27401	4420	If, for example, one wants to learn the difference between an agnostic philosophy and a deist one, but has no access to any agnostic books, which were banned by intolerant religious zealots, you cannot effectively learn anything	10
27402	4420	Every special interest group wants to ban a certain type of material	11
27403	4420	Author Katherine Paterson said that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	12
27404	4420	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS6 this is true	13
27405	4420	If every special interest group deems it proper to censor material that is against their interests, there will be no material left	14
27406	4420	There will be no knoledge left	15
27407	4420	Withought knowledge, we as a human race are left in the dark	16
27408	4420	Many books are banned that address great problems of society	17
27409	4420	@PERSON3's @CAPS7 @NUM1 addressed the growing problems of censorship and the dangers of technology	18
27410	4420	As the fireman @CAPS8 @PERSON4 burnt books, so ironically the novel was censored	19
27411	4420	Perhaps this is a ploy by the censors to defend theire special interest, that is censorship	20
27412	4420	They feel powerfull when they restrict other people's freedoms	21
27413	4420	A novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS9 @CAPS10, was banned	22
27414	4420	Apart from vulgar language in the book, @CAPS9 @CAPS10 also denounced free will and portrayed the US's brutal bombing of @LOCATION1 in @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS15	23
27415	4420	This book reveals much about human truth, yet it was banned	24
27416	4420	How will society ever change if any time a revolutionary book is written it is banned	25
27417	4420	Censorship is a great problem	26
27418	4420	Although there are many works that are meaninglessly violent, brutal and cruel, no book or any other material should be censored	27
27419	4420	In public libraries and schools, censorship is blatently unconstitutional	28
27420	4420	Censorship prevents people from seeing the whole perspective, and censorship hinders societal change	29
27421	4420	Censorship must be denounced as a restriction on our inteligence and liberty.	30
27422	4421	Children are our future because when I am old they will be the ones who are caring for me, so for me censorship is big deal for me	0
27423	4421	It's a big deal not only because of how it will affect my children, but because it will affect me and what everybody else will be able to read	1
27424	4421	I agree that censorship is an importaint issue but to what extent should it be taken	2
27425	4421	People should have the right to read what they want to	3
27426	4421	They should also be allowed to find it in their local public libraries	4
27427	4421	My veiw on censorship in public libraries is that most things should be allowed to stay on the book shelf	5
27428	4421	I can understand censorship to an extent, but taking books out of a public libraries makes it hard to chose where to draw the line	6
27429	4421	You don't want a book taken out just because it has a bad word in it	7
27430	4421	Just because some books are classics that everyone knows, does that mean that we shouldn't take that book out of a public library	8
27431	4421	I do beleive that some books should stay because adults don't want to be reading kids books they most likely want to be reading a more complex book	9
27432	4421	I think their are some books that should stay out of the library though	10
27433	4421	A example is books that are extremly racist	11
27434	4421	These books should be kept far away from are children	12
27435	4421	This is needed because younger children might try to act out things they might hear or read because there are audio books and those would just make them say those things	13
27436	4421	This could cause them to get in trouble for things they don't understand yet	14
27437	4421	There is things that you can do as an alterative to keep these things out of the hands of children	15
27438	4421	There is already one that is used in public libraries and it is seperateing the adutl books from the children books	16
27439	4421	You could also move these two sections to oppisite sides of the library	17
27440	4421	the books that are more explicit cold be put higher up such as on a top shelf	18
27441	4421	Most kids would not be able to reach as high as a adult	19
27442	4421	These are my veiws and ideas on censorship in libraries	20
27443	4421	The ideas and veiws that I have are most likely different than most people	21
27444	4421	I thought that they were good ideas though	22
27445	4421	Ones such as seperate section for kids and adults	23
27446	4421	I thought my best one was puting the more explicit books up higher and moving the sections farther a part.	24
27447	4422	Books, music, movies, and magazines are all a form of expression	0
27448	4422	We have the freedom to @ORGANIZATION1 the way we feel or think, but can it be to graphic for some to read	1
27449	4422	I believe censorship in libraries are needed to protect the minds of children and people who are easily influenced by the thoughts of others	2
27450	4422	Books are a major factor in expressing the way one feels about a topic from romance to horror	3
27451	4422	Many children like to read books or comic books that invovle a great deal of violence	4
27452	4422	Childrens mind's are like sponges, which means they soke up anything they read about and it has a great chance at influencing their functioning to everyday activities	5
27453	4422	If you go into a music store you will find many different types of music from rap to blue grass	6
27454	4422	I've noticed in my school that a particular type of music that stands out is rap and the favorite artist is @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1	7
27455	4422	@ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 has been known for rapping about drugs, sex, money, and violence	8
27456	4422	Many teens think that if their favorite artist can do all this why can't they	9
27457	4422	I've only listened to a few songs by @ORGANIZATION2 and in every song one of those four key topics comes up	10
27458	4422	Like @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 the movie industry is starting to come out with more and more movies about drugs, sex, money, and violence	11
27459	4422	Many students in my school talk about the latest comedy movies like '@ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS1', '@CAPS2' ect	12
27460	4422	and how they turned their life into something like those movies when they go on @DATE1 or @DATE2 break	13
27461	4422	Movies like those are funny to watch but for someone who is easily influenced shouldn't be watching them	14
27462	4422	Books, music, movies, and magazines, they surround us with their stories and thoughts of another human being	15
27463	4422	We do have the freedom and the right to @ORGANIZATION1 ourselves but we also have the right to take it away if we feel it is endangering the minds of others	16
27464	4422	I think censorship in a library from certain things is a good option in cleaning up a mind poisoning mess	17
27465	4425	Katherine Paterson made a valid point in stating that some books are to offensive for some people to read, but that does not mean they they should not be read	0
27466	4425	Time and time throughout someone's life we hear things that we do not like nor want to be bothered with, but it is good that we do	1
27467	4425	Libraries should have to right to open all types of books to their shelves and not have them be censored by the public, this is why	2
27468	4425	We, as people of the @CAPS1 have battled through hard times	3
27469	4425	@CAPS2, racistism, and extreme poverty or depression are just a few to recall	4
27470	4425	Having delt with those issues we alwaying tend to repeat them out of lack of knowledge	5
27471	4425	Slavery and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were some of the @CAPS1's lowest moments and they were also very gruesome	6
27472	4425	Recalling those memeries is difficult but something that needs to be done	7
27473	4425	if books were to be cencored then many young adults would not be educated and could repeat such horrible actions	8
27474	4425	Pertaning to movies, music and magzines the same laws applies	9
27475	4425	Though not in the same way, many times these publications are written about current news or social aspects of life	10
27476	4425	Music is a form a expression and everyone has their own taste	11
27477	4425	Not having to opition to chose froma variety of styles is wrong and unfair	12
27478	4425	Music can not only be an expression feeling about love or angry but it can also teach life lesson's	13
27479	4425	Some artist like to sing or rap on their life journey	14
27480	4425	This can educate others in to knowing that if you do this then this is the result, good or bad	15
27481	4425	In a magzine they tend to lean towards more current topics such a politics, jobs, or young adults lifestyles	16
27482	4425	Movies apply to the same rights and topics	17
27483	4425	Each on is egualily as important and if a group of citizens feel that it is not then who are they to make that call	18
27484	4425	What gives a group of people the right to say this is inapporicate and that you should not read it	19
27485	4425	They do not have it	20
27486	4425	In the constitution is states that you have freedom of speech and that means you can express it anyway you choose	21
27487	4425	By censoring what people read that is in a way taking away that author right to speak	22
27488	4425	Now, that is unfair	23
27489	4425	Though Katherine Paterson made a vaild point in saying that some books are to offensive to read, she just simiply is not right	24
27490	4425	A library is supposed to be a place where people can find a book, music, movie, magazine of any genre  and read it	25
27491	4425	If matericals were cencored then that is unfair to someone else who does want to read it	26
27492	4425	Bottom line is that you have free will and you have to power to choose weather or not you want to read something	27
27493	4426	There are things in the world that are not ment for certain people to see	0
27494	4426	Things like rated @CAPS1 movies, @CAPS2 books, alcohol, and @CAPS2 music are not ment for children	1
27495	4426	Yes people have rights, they can view whatever they want	2
27496	4426	If a @CAPS4 wants to see a rated @CAPS1 movie or drink a beer that is the parents choice to let that @CAPS4 see that movie not the person running the store	3
27497	4426	If you are under the age limit a store keeper should have the right to tell you, you can't go in the store or buy his product	4
27498	4426	Is it okay for a storkeeper to to tell your @CAPS4 no	5
27499	4426	Some would say yes to this and others would say no	6
27500	4426	If your @CAPS4 is trying to buy a movie with guns, blood, and killing, and you don't want your @CAPS4 to have this movie you might be mad if a store keeper let your @CAPS4 buy it	7
27501	4426	On the other hand you might be mad if this store keeper told your @CAPS4 he wasnt allowed to buy this movie	8
27502	4426	If the rated @CAPS1 is based on maturaty how does this store keeper know how mature your @CAPS4 really is	9
27503	4426	Your @CAPS4 could be a one that likes to copy the things they see on movies, the store keeper doesn't know if this is true or not	10
27504	4426	He doesn't know this @CAPS4, he can't say if he is mature enough to watch this movie with guns, blood, and killing	11
27505	4426	How would this store keeper feel if this @CAPS4 watched this movie he let the @CAPS4 buy and the @CAPS4 went out and killed someone, how would you feel if this happened	12
27506	4426	This wouldn't happen if there was an age limit	13
27507	4426	If a group of @NUM1 year olds who just got their license go into a liquor store and try to buy beer, who is going to stop them from drinking and driving if there is no age limit on drinking	14
27508	4426	Lives get wasted when teenagers make choices like drinking and driving	15
27509	4426	When your @NUM2 years old you don't think about whats going to happen after you make a choice, you just think about how fun it's going to be while your doing it	16
27510	4426	Most 12-@NUM2 year olds aren't mature enough to make decisions in the spure of the moment	17
27511	4426	There for there should be an age limit for some things, maybe not all things in the world, like weather or not your @CAPS4 can buy a candy bar or a soda	18
27512	4426	But an age limit on buying an @CAPS1 rated movie, alcohol, guns, knives exc	19
27513	4426	What would the world be like if children went around with these things	20
27514	4426	With an age limit on ceritain this there wouldn't be a probelm with these things	21
27515	4427	What do you go to the library for	0
27516	4427	In earlier times libraries used to be the place where you went to study	1
27517	4427	They were no computers, and so you had to go look up your work in a educational book at the library	2
27518	4427	Is that truly what people are doing at the libraries now, or are people there to look at vulgar books, magazines, and movies	3
27519	4427	A library is meant to be the place where you can go to work in peace and have a helpful resource of educational books	4
27520	4427	But, now you can go to the library and be tempted to look at books you shouldn't be looking at	5
27521	4427	Instead you could be on the computer the whole time playing games of some sort	6
27522	4427	The possibilites are endless	7
27523	4427	People now could go to the library and check out a magazine, movie, or book on: pornagrophy, drugs, achlocol, or worse	8
27524	4427	Is that really what you want your kid to accidently pick up at the library	9
27525	4427	Presonally I myself witnessed a little kid pick up a porn magazine at the library, and his mom had to grab it very fast before he had the chance to look at the magazine	10
27526	4427	The library should not be used for this, and the treat of young kids accidently looking at these materials should not be happening in the library	11
27527	4427	The music some one could listen is also very bad, and your child could listen to that	12
27528	4427	Then what if they want to keep listening to it	13
27529	4427	Yes, the world does have a huge impact on what is put into the library	14
27530	4427	because, drugs, sex, scandals, and achlocol seem to be what most teenagers are intereseted in at some point in their young life	15
27531	4427	But a library is a community building and there is no stopping some one from coming in and easily getting these vuglar things	16
27532	4427	The thoughts of the youth is completely swayed after they watch, read, or listen to this	17
27533	4427	And, this needs to be controled	18
27534	4427	Women and children can find all of these materials offensive	19
27535	4427	These materials need to be censored more then what the are right now	20
27536	4427	Libraries should be a safe place where people can go to study or get a book, and not to be tempted to look at something they should not be looking at	21
27537	4427	Many people find this offensive	22
27538	4427	Yes, in the end libraries are a great place, but the people who do not use libraries for the right reasons are why these materials need to be censored at the libraries	23
27539	4428	A library card is one thing a kid always looked forward to	0
27540	4428	It's the first piece of identification that many kids have that they are allowed to carry around themselves.The card opens up a whole new world of entertainment and storys that can take you anywhere you want to go	1
27541	4428	Once a kid owned a library card, they were allowed to check out any book they wanted out of the huge selection of items in a library	2
27542	4428	But how do you keep a young child from checking out a book, movie, or magazine about inappropriate adult material	3
27543	4428	A solution to this problem should be formed so that people can be protected from material they don't want to see in a book, movie, or any other source of entertainment	4
27544	4428	Libraries today normally have a specified children's section, where picture books and short stories litter the shelves	5
27545	4428	The rest of the building is a scattering of books and other materials sorted only by author name and genre	6
27546	4428	The only way to understand what the item is about is to flip through the pages or read the back cover and try to find a hint of how the plot goes	7
27547	4428	This could be dangerous at times because not all materials give a specific summary of what happens	8
27548	4428	I once rented a movie expecting it to be a scary thriller about a killer in a trailer park	9
27549	4428	It ended up being scary for another reason, as multiple uncensored sex scenes were displayed throughout the first couple minutes of the feature	10
27550	4428	I had no idea the movie was going to involve scenes like that and I was disgusted that there was no warning	11
27551	4428	I believe items like that should be placed in a seperate area or at least be required to give a summary of the kind of offensive material in them	12
27552	4428	Libraries could collect viewer comments, allowing people who had checked out an item to write what they thought about it	13
27553	4428	People could then read these comments before checking out that item	14
27554	4428	Viewer comments would be a good way to get someones else's opinion on what the item contained before another decided to rent it	15
27555	4428	Another effective way to help this problem would be to give materials a certain rating, like the ratings of movies when they come out in theaters	16
27556	4428	A specific rating would warn viewers or readers from checking out an item that is offensive or inappropriate	17
27557	4428	Libraries could also give specific age ranges according to the ratings on an item, not allowing anyone under a certain age limit to check out a book from the building	18
27558	4428	Ratings would help keep offensive books out of a child's hands, or that of anyone else who didn't want to be exposed	19
27559	4428	Libraries hold all different kinds of materials about any subject you could think of	20
27560	4428	They can open a whole new world to learn and be entertained but also a world of inappropriate items	21
27561	4428	I believe items with offensive material should be either put in a seperate area, or given a certain rating in order to warn people before checking it out	22
27562	4428	Allowing viewers to make comments about the material could also be very helpful	23
27563	4428	Libraries are a wonderful place full of great stories and adventures, so they should not be polluted with offensive and inappropriate material	24
27564	4429	Do you find books you read offensive	0
27565	4429	How about music, or magazines	1
27566	4429	I sure don't	2
27567	4429	I can't think of why someone would be offended about a book they chose to read	3
27568	4429	If you sit back and think about it, there should be a low amout of reasons that someone should be offended by a book that is written for the general public	4
27569	4429	I believe that it is possible for there to be books that have offensive words or actions in them, but unless they are directed towards the reader, or intentionally being used to offend someone then it is just a book	5
27570	4429	A lot of books, especially ones on history, use language and actions that were used during that time	6
27571	4429	They use them to show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during the time	7
27572	4429	Not very often, or that I have ever seen, do the authors make a book to just to put someone down	8
27573	4429	I tend to see books just explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set a tone of the book	9
27574	4429	Music on the other hand could be thought of as different	10
27575	4429	Many people could take music in the wrong way	11
27576	4429	A majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap	12
27577	4429	Rappers tend to express themselves throughly, and in doing that often times use very offensive language	13
27578	4429	I personally don't get botherd by the music, because they are usually refering to their own life and how things went with them	14
27579	4429	Music can also be on the good side too	15
27580	4429	When you get the calm and collective music, it tends to help people and can be used to help people relax	16
27581	4429	Therefore music can be either way, but it mostly goes about who the person is and how they react to what they listen to	17
27582	4429	Then you have magazines	18
27583	4429	Personally I think they are the worst of all	19
27584	4429	Magazines tend to go one way or the other	20
27585	4429	They either put a person down and be completely negative towards them, or they are positive and say nothing but good about them	21
27586	4429	One big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear, not always knowing the full story	22
27587	4429	In that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about	23
27588	4429	Magazines always have a positive, but where there is a positive they have a harsh negative thing to put in with it	24
27589	4429	In these regaurds, I believe that there is nothing wrong with a library	25
27590	4429	There are always going to be negatives and positives, but libraries tend to stick with the positive side	26
27591	4429	Plus if a book looks like it might end up being offensive towards you, then there is no one that can tell you that you can't just put it down and stop reading it	27
27592	4429	With music, only get stuff that you like and if you are easily offended don't listen to that music	28
27593	4429	Libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy	29
27594	4429	There is no reason someone would not be able to refrain from going in and getting an offensive book	30
27595	4429	In saying this, it can go either way	31
27596	4429	I don't believe there is anything worng with libraries censorship as long as you can use your own good judgement.	32
27597	4430	Imagine your favorite book, song, and movie	0
27598	4430	The ones that you love to watch, listen to, or read a million times over	1
27599	4430	The ones that you keep on checking out from the library again and again because you love it so much	2
27600	4430	Now imagine it gone from the libraries	3
27601	4430	What happened to it	4
27602	4430	You think that it has been checked out, but later you find that it has been removed from the shelves because someone found it offensive	5
27603	4430	What can you do	6
27604	4430	When you go to the library, you usually expect a huge selections of books and other materials to choose from	7
27605	4430	A library helps many people of all ages be able to choose whatever they are interested in	8
27606	4430	This is one reason why libraries are so popular among all people	9
27607	4430	If the libraries were to begin to remove items off of the shelves that they found offensive, many people would not be able to find all the items that they enjoyed anymore	10
27608	4430	I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinions	11
27609	4430	Libraries should accomodate as many people as they are able	12
27610	4430	Removing material from the shelves @MONTH1 make some people happy, but it would also take away items that many people find enjoyable	13
27611	4430	Libraries should not remove items from the shelves if they are found offensive	14
27612	4430	Doing this could result in less material for people of all ages	15
27613	4430	If you find something to be offensive, all that you have to do is not check the book or other material out	16
27614	4430	In Katherine Paterson's words, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	17
27615	4430	And then we have no books left on teh shelf for any of us.' I believe that if items were to be removed from the shelves, there would be less for others to enjoy	18
27616	4430	Taking materials off of the shelves would be unfair to all readers	19
27617	4430	Everyone has a favorite book or movie that they love to read or watch	20
27618	4430	If someone were to disagree with this, this would not only disable you from reading or watching what you love, but it also takes away from other readers who didn't have a chance to make their own opinions on the material	21
27619	4430	Many people have different ideas on what they feel is offensive	22
27620	4430	While some @MONTH1 think that some books have subjects too racy for readers, others @MONTH1 not feel that this is not the case	23
27621	4430	Take a popular childrens book like @LOCATION1's @CAPS1	24
27622	4430	To some, this @MONTH1 be one of the best books ever written	25
27623	4430	If someone disagreed with this and felt that it was too serious or offensive to young readers, many new readers would never know this book	26
27624	4430	They would have never had the chance to make their own opinions	27
27625	4430	I feel that censorship in libraries is an extreme show of personal opinion	28
27626	4430	It is only natural to disagree with someone	29
27627	4430	You can always run into people that don't share the same feelings about certain types of music or movies	30
27628	4430	Eliminating material from the shelves would be unfair to people	31
27629	4430	If everyone were to take their least favorite book off of the shelves and replace it with one they like better, soon the libraries would be filled with items that would only reach out to a certain audience	32
27630	4430	Libraries are meant to fulfill everyone's desires and taste	33
27631	4430	To conclude, taking items off the shelves because they are offensive to someone would not be fair	34
27632	4430	In fact, I believe that doing so would create more problems for people	35
27633	4430	If an item that someone was looking forward to checking out was no longer available due to censorship, many people @MONTH1 even decide that they don't want to go to the library anymore	36
27634	4430	What is great about the library is that you have a huge selection of items to choose from	37
27635	4430	If censorship were to take place, the library would no longer be a place to enjoy	38
27636	4430	Censoring material would be like telling a reader that their opinions were not as important as those of the people who found it offensive	39
27637	4430	I believe that if you find something so terribly offensive that you don't want it available to check out at the library, first think to yourself what you would do if the library didn't have your favorite things	40
27638	4430	Because after all, what you think is offensive @MONTH1 be the best thing in the world to someone else.	41
27639	4431	Everyone has books that they do not like or do not approve of	0
27640	4431	What if one of your children came home from a library with one of those books	1
27641	4431	My view on censorship in a library is that if you don't like it then don't read it	2
27642	4431	I think they should have a childrens section and an adult section in the library so you won't have to worry about the problem	3
27643	4431	If a child wants a book from the adult section then he or she would need to have a parent with them	4
27644	4431	That way the kid wouldn't bring home any books that there parent wouldn't approve of or allow them read	5
27645	4431	If you are an adult and you don't like a book then simply just don't read it	6
27646	4431	Maybe other readers like the book and don't want it taken off of the shelf	7
27647	4431	They wouldn't be able to say that the reason they want it off of the shelf is because they don't want there children to see it because there children would need there permission to check out the book anyways	8
27648	4431	I think this way would be much easier for all readers to enjoy the library and they would not have to worry about picking out a book they don't like or there parents would not approve of	9
27649	4432	Do I think that certain books, music, movies, magazines should be removed from our librarys	0
27650	4432	No i dont think they should be removed, they could be placed in another part of the library away from all the other books that aren't offensive	1
27651	4432	If they did decide to remove these books are kids would have a hard time learning about the truth	2
27652	4432	Book publishers put only what they want are kids to learn	3
27653	4432	Most of the time they leave out bits and pecies about what really happened	4
27654	4432	So if they took the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines out, a lot of kids would just go home everyday and sit around or cause trouble	5
27655	4432	From my own experience, I enjoyed reading, listening, and watching the offensive materials they want to take out of our librarys	6
27656	4432	So if you don't like the offensive materials then don't even look at them, that will solve your problem, and teach your children that to	7
27657	4432	Overall I think they should keep the offensive materials	8
27658	4432	If people still complain, move it to another part of the library, in seperate room or somethin of that kind	9
27659	4432	This should solve the problem of kids reading, listening, and watching these kinds of things.	10
27660	4433	Be a parent or responsible child  if you are against censorship	0
27661	4433	Censorship is really unavoidable, and it should not be an issue	1
27662	4433	If you dont want to read the magazine, book or watch the movie then just dont watch it	2
27663	4433	Myriads amount of people avoid it every day if they dont want to see it, and many people do read and watch those bad types of movies	3
27664	4433	It is a personal choice and you dont have to be exposed to it if you dont want to	4
27665	4433	Those who are against censorship try some ways of keeping your children away from the bad or yourself, but dont try to remove it completly	5
27666	4433	One reason for censorship is because it provides hordes of information and expands your mind in different ways	6
27667	4433	The material or bad material you get out of it is your choice to read	7
27668	4433	but i think some of it is good for kids not so that they can be corrupted	8
27669	4433	It is so the kids can expand there imagination as well	9
27670	4433	However i do think children should wait until they are of certain age to read or watch this material until they are mature enough to seperate reality from fiction	10
27671	4433	Also it teaches good @CAPS1 that you might not have learned anywhere else	11
27672	4433	Numerous of these articles are about real life and what is going on today	12
27673	4433	I think it is great for kids and adults to know what is going on in the world	13
27674	4433	If you leave kids in darkness then you leave them with no right of an oponion	14
27675	4433	Any parent can tell there child that something is bad for them, but you can never really know unless you experience it for themselves	15
27676	4433	The can make up there own minds, and usually they do what is best	16
27677	4433	Another reason for censorship is that it can be an escape for some people	17
27678	4433	There are people who enjoy reading about fiction or tacky things in life	18
27679	4433	It keeps them going on a regular day basis	19
27680	4433	You never know what somebody enjoys doing	20
27681	4433	If somebody is having a bad day and they want to read or watch what they like and find out they are unable now there is a good chance poeple will be furious	21
27682	4433	If i was unable to do what I like to do i would probably be angry or depressed	22
27683	4433	It is not alway a ferocious topic	23
27684	4433	If you want to keep your children sheltered from it then fine, but the people who can handle it dont want it to be out of public access	24
27685	4433	Also keep it in libraries because if you dont want it dont give your kids library passes	25
27686	4433	However if  you do,  supervise them while they are there	26
27687	4433	It costs money to go out and buy books when you can just borrow them from the library	27
27688	4433	People who dont have money or dont want to own the books shouldnt have to go pay for them when it can be kept from whoever it needs to be kept from	28
27689	4433	The last reason for Censorship is it keeps people interested	29
27690	4433	It also teaches oodles of information	30
27691	4433	Not only does it entertain, but also there is so much vocab you pick up on from these books	31
27692	4433	I have personally learned most of my @CAPS1 from books, and i hardly had to pay for any of them	32
27693	4433	When you dont have the money to guy buy all the books you want the library has the same information for you, but its just more availiable rather than going to the store	33
27694	4433	Whoever finds it offensive thats fine	34
27695	4433	There is nobody forcing you to take these items off of the shelves, and its not there business what other people see either	35
27696	4433	If people really want to read these items they are going to one way or another banning them from one place is not going to remove censorship from our world	36
27697	4433	Children are already exposed to this in school and on telivision	37
27698	4433	They need to learn more than just appropriate material if they want to understand the real world.Censorship is viewed as good, bad, and neutral	38
27699	4433	Nobody is forcing you to view it, but on the other hand nobody can force you to stay away from it	39
27700	4433	Let people make there own decisions	40
27701	4433	If you keep complaining there will be numerous amounts of complaints right back at you	41
27702	4433	Censhorship should be taken as 'sticks and stones will break my bones , but words will never hurt me'	42
27703	4433	With that being said dont avoid the inevitable.	43
27704	4434	I do not believe that these types of books should be taken off of the shelves	0
27705	4434	Everybody has their likes and dislikes with music, books, movies, magazines, etc	1
27706	4434	If the reader does not like the book, then the reader will not continue reading the book	2
27707	4434	If the listener does not enjoy rap music, then they will stop listening and try to find a different kind of music	3
27708	4434	This topic is about personal opinion and choice	4
27709	4434	If it was me, then I would say yes to allowing censored materials	5
27710	4434	I like getting the full effect out of things	6
27711	4434	I wanna hear the rawness of a song or the anger of a character in a book	7
27712	4434	I don't want to read and see a bunch of little stars on a censored word	8
27713	4434	I want to see that word and feel its full effect	9
27714	4434	I am actually reading the very controversial book '@CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1'	10
27715	4434	As you @MONTH1 know the author of this book is named @PERSON1	11
27716	4434	Another thing you @MONTH1 know is the use of the '@CAPS2-word'	12
27717	4434	This is a very controversial book because he doesn't call colored people black or colored, he calls them the '@CAPS2-word' throughout most of the book	13
27718	4434	Most people now think this is very racist	14
27719	4434	But back in @LOCATION1's time it was very commonly said and used in his society	15
27720	4434	It wasn't racist back in that time, I mean it still was but it wasn't as controversial as it is today	16
27721	4434	Now critics and some readers don't agree with this term and think the book should not be held in libraries or read at all for that fact	17
27722	4434	I have to disagree though	18
27723	4434	I understand why he used the word, it was a common word in his time	19
27724	4434	If you take that word away from the book, you lose some history of the old south	20
27725	4434	People have the freedom of speech to say whatever they want to say, whether that be in written form or verbally said	21
27726	4434	I honestly say some of these censored words	22
27727	4434	Most of the time these words are said when I am angry at myself or another person	23
27728	4434	People can't control what we say, so why should they be able to control what we write or sing	24
27729	4434	Just a thought	25
27730	4434	Saying that, on the other hand I can see why people don't want these censored words	26
27731	4434	Maybe they just don't want their little kid to say a censored word in class to the teacher or to another classmate	27
27732	4434	That's understandable, but you can't protect your kids from censored words	28
27733	4434	They are everywhere	29
27734	4434	From video games, to movies, and even most books now	30
27735	4434	You cannot control what other people do or say	31
27736	4434	It is their freedom to do whatever they want.	32
27737	4435	I don't think that censorship in labraries is right, for many reasons	0
27738	4435	First reason is that all books and contents that a public library offers to the community should be open to everyone	1
27739	4435	Second reason is that what you might think is not appropiate, to someone it might not be	2
27740	4435	Last reason is that an author has the right to express himself on is book how he feels, without having to worry that his book might be taken off the shelves of public labraries	3
27741	4435	My first reason why I think that censorship is not right is that all contents of a library should be open to the community	4
27742	4435	For example if a student needed to do research on how black slaves were treated back in history,he might not be able to find a book, to find information on it because someone thought books like that are offensive to black people, so in this case this student wouldn't be able to find any information on his topic, because of the censorship in his library, so instead of going to a library he will have to go somewhere else, where he might find the wrong type of information	5
27743	4435	Second reason is that what you might think is offensive, might not be to another person	6
27744	4435	So why should your point of view affect another person	7
27745	4435	It wouldn't be fair that a point of view of one person would limit the choices that a person has when he goes to the library	8
27746	4435	Censorship could take away your favorite series of books of the public library because of group of people thought it was offensive	9
27747	4435	My last reason is that an author has the right to express himself on his book how he wants, without having to worry that his book might get taken off the shelves of public libraries for its contents	10
27748	4435	Sometimes the content that books have is needed to make the book for discriptive, and interisting to the reader	11
27749	4435	Content that you might think is offensive, is the content that really helps the reader understand the book better	12
27750	4435	This are the reasons why i think that censorship is not right	13
27751	4435	Because if we had censorship on public libraries, then we wouldn't have any books left on the shelves for us to read	14
27752	4435	So this are my reasons to support my opinion.	15
27753	4436	No book should be taken off the shelves for any reason	0
27754	4436	Books are a very important part of most peoples daily lives	1
27755	4436	Whether they are used for school or just entertainment they are used for a good purpose and are always helpful	2
27756	4436	People have different likes and interests and everyone wants to be able to read what they want without having to worry whether the books will still be on shelves tomorrow	3
27757	4436	For some people books are a great past time	4
27758	4436	They help you learn and even help with hard life situations	5
27759	4436	Books are the world to most people and without them those people would not know what to do with their lives	6
27760	4436	No one should be aloud to take something away that is important to other people even if it is offensive	7
27761	4436	All books have a purpose and a message that they want to get out or else the authors would not have taken time out of their lives to write them down and have them published	8
27762	4436	The author writes to tell people a story whether good or bad, he or she wanted to get that story out there to inform people	9
27763	4436	The stories are obviously important to the author and important to the readers that enjoy their books	10
27764	4436	The authors should not be punished just because someone is offended by what he or she wrote	11
27765	4436	If people are so offended then they should just stay away from the books that the certain author writes	12
27766	4436	There are plenty of books out there and many different authors that the person can choose from	13
27767	4436	They do not have to take it out on certain authors just because they did not enjoy what other people might	14
27768	4436	There are so many books out there and odds are there is always going to be a book that offends someone	15
27769	4436	If we get rid of every single book that offends people then we are not going to have many books left, and without books we have nothing	16
27770	4436	Books are the key point to education and most peoples daily lives	17
27771	4436	We will not learn the new ideas that authors put out there for us if people just keep getting offended and taking them off the shelves	18
27772	4436	Books need to stay on the shelves	19
27773	4436	They are important to everyone, whether they want to admit it or not	20
27774	4436	Without books people would not be where they are today	21
27775	4437	Libraries should censor some of the materials that they have available to the public	0
27776	4437	This is important because a child could easily gain access to the offensive material	1
27777	4437	Censorship is very important for libraries because we do not want our children getting influenced by offensive materials found in their libraries	2
27778	4437	The libraries would not even have to get rid of the offensive materials that they took from the shelves	3
27779	4437	A good idea for them to do is to move all of them to an section for adults so the children will not be able to see them	4
27780	4437	The libraries would not be losing any money and they would be keeping the youth away from things that are not appropriate for them	5
27781	4437	Their is no reason to give people access to material that could be offensive to other people	6
27782	4437	There are only a few reasons why I think that people should have access to offensive materials	7
27783	4437	Someone could need to use a book that has something offensive in it, but they would all be taken away to somewhere else	8
27784	4437	I think that it depends how offensive the materials are, as to whether or not they should be removed from the shelves	9
27785	4437	Although I am sort of split on this issue, there are some very good reasons why to move the offensive materials away from the shelves	10
27786	4437	Those materials are not appropriate for the youth of our country, and they should not have access to them	11
27787	4437	We should censor the libraries so that nobody gets hurt	12
27788	4439	Although possibly offending some people, materials that are in libraries that could possibly be considered 'offensive' are actually good to keep around	0
27789	4439	If people who find the materials in libraries offensive are getting upset over the lack of censorship within the library itsself, they should re-think the situation and consider that the 'offensive' materials that are left within libraries could be considered appropriate IF the viewer is ready to experience them	1
27790	4439	If a person does not want to be exposed to things in libraries that could be considered offensive, then they can altogether avoid these materials	2
27791	4439	If parents find the materials that are within libraries offensive, they should monitor their children while they are visiting their library	3
27792	4439	The mateirals that could be considered offensive @MONTH1 actually be good, educational media that a person could learn from	4
27793	4439	If @CAPS1 within libraries increases, 'then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 in libraries should remain the same as it is now	5
27794	4439	Some books, movies, and any other number of things that can be found within libraries are bieng labeled as innapropriate	6
27795	4439	These materials can be educational, however, and should not be removed from libraries altogether just because some of the materials are found to be too crude, vulgar, or adult-like for younger ages	7
27796	4439	Parents should monitor their children while in a library as to not let them stumble upon something that they would not want them to see yet	8
27797	4439	If something is labeled as innappropriate for children to view by parents, then it is the parents responsibility to make sure thier child does not stumble upon it	9
27798	4439	Much of what @MONTH1 be considered as innapropriate and needing cencoroship in libraries to this day @MONTH1 actually hold some educational value or meaning to it	10
27799	4439	There are books and movies that are based off of true stories that have taken place that could be announced by parents as 'not appropriate to be viewed by children'	11
27800	4439	However, this does not mean that libraries should have to remove the material from their shelves just because parents @MONTH1 not think or necessarily agree that it would be appropriate for their child to read or see	12
27801	4439	It is the parents resposibility to see that their child does not check out what they would consider innappropriate	13
27802	4439	Much of the things within libraries that might be considered innappropriate for children hold good eduactional value and should not have to be removed from the shelves of the library simply because parents find it not age appropriate for their children	14
27803	4439	@CAPS1 in libraries should remain the same as it is now so that those who want to see or read the stories or movies can do so without having to buy them	15
27804	4439	If parents want to make a big deal out of how libraries hold materials that are not appropriate for their children, they can either altogether not go to a library or they can monitor their children closely if they bring them along on a library visit	16
27805	4439	I have found that when I visit my library, I look at it as a source of knowledge that has been pooled in one place, written and created by thousands of authors, all of which took time out of their own lives to create it	17
27806	4439	If we are going to remove these books or movies from libraries, I think it would be taking away the rights that people have to the materials that SHOULD be provided by a library	18
27807	4439	@CAPS1 in libraries should remain the same as it is today so that people can enjoy all that should be within it, even if some of it is labeled as innappropriate by parents	19
27808	4440	Imagine a world where nearly every other book is banned for some reason or another	0
27809	4440	That world is not a world I want to live in	1
27810	4440	I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong	2
27811	4440	For three reasons, really, the first being that people have the right to any information that they desire to have	3
27812	4440	The second, people do not have the power to take opportunities away from other people	4
27813	4440	The last point I will make is that no information is bad information	5
27814	4440	Because we are in @LOCATION1, I asume that we are talking about censorship in @CAPS1 libraries	6
27815	4440	If that is the case, then I think that it is unconstituitional to ban any book, or censor any material	7
27816	4440	Censoring books is like putting a blind fold on whoever is reading the material	8
27817	4440	they don't see it for what it really is, or for what the intended purpose is	9
27818	4440	If the prompt does happen to be including foreign countries, then I think humans do not have the right to influence what other people read	10
27819	4440	This is idealistic, yes, and in a perfect world, all countires would have equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or gender	11
27820	4440	I think that people should see everything the way it is	12
27821	4440	If something is offensive, it's offensive	13
27822	4440	It's the person's choice whether or not they read or listen	14
27823	4440	That leads me to my last point, that no information can be bad information	15
27824	4440	Whether it is profane, or offensive in any way, there is always some kind of meaning behind it	16
27825	4440	From rappers like @PERSON2 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, who I've found all of their songs have meaning, whether it's personal, or they are trying to send a message out to the people	17
27826	4440	There are books like @CAPS4 for @LOCATION2, by @ORGANIZATION1, which has recently been banned by some school libraries because of graphic scenes	18
27827	4440	The people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes	19
27828	4440	There is a much deeper message about guilt and grief, and redemption beneath it	20
27829	4440	Another, more famous book that was banned from school libraries is The @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6, by @PERSON1, which is a coming of age story about a boy	21
27830	4440	In conclusion, I don not think it is right to ban books or music from libraries	22
27831	4440	No one has the right to.There is always meaning within	23
27832	4440	The way an author writes a story or a piece of music always has meaning	24
27833	4440	they made the conscious decision to write it that way for a reason	25
27834	4440	By banning books, they are taking people's chances to grow and expand.	26
27835	4441	Censorship is very important, especially when you are reffering to libraries	0
27836	4441	I believe that each individual person is entitled to an opinion	1
27837	4441	If a certain book, magazine, movie, etc., is offensive to one specific person or a wide variety of people, those individuals should consult an official who has authority and decides what goes on and off the shelfs about what they think or feel about their choice of selection	2
27838	4441	In the world, there are many different types of minorites, racial groups, and also differences in political groups, (@CAPS1 and @CAPS2)	3
27839	4441	Even though these seperate groups are extremly different from one another, they all share one thing in common	4
27840	4441	No matter who believes what or who supports who, everyone will always have a difference in voice	5
27841	4441	Some people @MONTH1 feel that having particular material displayed on shelves of libraries is rather offensive to specific individuals	6
27842	4441	Where as others like myself say, as said earlier, if you are to have a problem with something displayed, then you should contact someone who will listen to what you have to say	7
27843	4441	For example, I cannot express that I desire to have something removed from a library shelf just because I am the one who finds the material a concern	8
27844	4441	Not everything is decided by me	9
27845	4441	It would be incredibly rude to state that something is offensive to me might not be to someone else	10
27846	4441	Just because I don't approve of something gives me no right to purposely remove something from the shelf	11
27847	4441	That is all related to freedom of speech	12
27848	4441	However, yes, you do in fact have the right to say what bothers you, but you do not own the privledge of doing what you want at any time because you have opposesed views	13
27849	4441	It is true to say that we all argee we do not want to see inapropriate material displayed on library shelfs, especially for childrens sake, ergo, libraries should take major consideration of restricting specific areas of a library for adult views only	14
27850	4441	I know suggestive material might be a concern for one, so not allowing children of a certain age to see certain material would be a highly good idea for any worried officals, adults, and parents.	15
27851	4442	A few months ago I was at the local library searching for the perfect book	0
27852	4442	After an hour of searching I decided on one	1
27853	4442	I was happy with my choice as I checked it out	2
27854	4442	As I anxiously started reading my book, I found language, drug abuse, and sexual content	3
27855	4442	As a teenager, I do not want or need to be exposed to any innapropriate material	4
27856	4442	No one should be exposed to that, and because of that experiance, I believe that censorship in libraries is a must	5
27857	4442	Due to sexual content, drug abuse, and vulgar language, one must be seventeen to purchase a ticket for a rated-@CAPS1 movie	6
27858	4442	I believe that since that is true for movies, it should also be true for books, magazines, and music	7
27859	4442	@CAPS2 literature is not necessary and innapropriate for any age	8
27860	4442	The world exposes certain literature to children, and then is shocked when they see children in jails, gangs, and other horrible situations	9
27861	4442	The world has set their standards too low, and the children of todays society are following after our footsteps	10
27862	4442	Author, Katherine Paterson once said,     '...if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right so does everyone else.' @CAPS2 quote shows the impact that people have on generations to come	11
27863	4442	Everyone has their own opinion and @CAPS2 is mine	12
27864	4442	As a daily newspaper reader, I could not quiet my voice any longer	13
27865	4442	I had to step-up and say something	14
27866	4442	I am apart of a generation that is being affected greatly by the world in a negative way	15
27867	4442	The first step to changing that is to set the standards high	16
27868	4442	Protect the future generations and censor what children are allowed to be exposed to	17
27869	4442	Situations will become better when libraries choose to censor and remove offensive materials from shelves	18
27870	4442	If libraries censor materials, then next time I wnat to find the perfect book, I will.	19
27871	4443	Every individual has their own opinion on censorship	0
27872	4443	Some people believe that, in some instances, it is perfectly fine, but others disagree	1
27873	4443	I'm one person that thinks that, in some instances, things should be censored	2
27874	4443	Schools have the right to censor what is put in their libraries for their students to read, especially magazines	3
27875	4443	Some of the magazines out there have articles in them that arent appropriate for school hours or even in the school building	4
27876	4443	Schools @MONTH1 not want something inapropriate on their shelves where students can see it	5
27877	4443	Censorship is even more understandable in elementary schools	6
27878	4443	Younger students' libraries should be monitored even more carefully	7
27879	4443	Younger kids, such as elementary age, don't really know what they should and shouldn't read	8
27880	4443	In public libraries, things are a little different	9
27881	4443	Parents can usually monitor what their kids check out	10
27882	4443	Most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out	11
27883	4443	If the summary is too vague, then they know to read a few pages inside the book	12
27884	4443	A couple of times, I've gone to the public library and I checked out a book that I thought was a suspense	13
27885	4443	When I got home and began reading it, it turned out I was wrong	14
27886	4443	The book was a romance book that I didn't care to read	15
27887	4443	So, I returned the book to the library	16
27888	4443	Most of the time you can read the synopsis on the back of the book, but that doesn't always reveal too much about the book	17
27889	4443	So, the best thing you can do is read a couple of pages out of the book before you check it out	18
27890	4443	Everyone has a right to their own opinion on censorship	19
27891	4443	I believe that in some instances things available to be checked out should be censored	20
27892	4443	In other instances, things should be left up to the adults and the parents to decided what they want to be allowed  to checked out.	21
27893	4445	WHAT DO I THINK	0
27894	4445	When I heard about the problems some librares were having	1
27895	4445	I thought to myself	2
27896	4445	What is the big issue over censoring movies, disks, books, and magazines	3
27897	4445	I know that children should not be around volgure language heard or read	4
27898	4445	Book that have pics @MONTH1 not be eseptible for the eyes of our young chidren either	5
27899	4445	The librares should come up with a solution	6
27900	4445	I was thinking that if they want to, they could make rooms of books that are only for certin ages	7
27901	4445	When people take these books of the shelf to report it or put that book somewhere else away from their children, they make the people that works their jobs much harder	8
27902	4445	Their should also be an adult with you if entering into the room	9
27903	4445	The adult must be @NUM1 or older	10
27904	4445	If a child is found in their aloun, the workers of the library will contact the childs parents as a @NUM2 offinse	11
27905	4445	The same thing goes for the second time your caght	12
27906	4445	The @NUM3 time you are caught, you will get a phone call to your parents and baned from the librery for @NUM4 mounths	13
27907	4445	If you live in a big city, you @MONTH1 have bigger better libraries	14
27908	4445	Some libraries have so many books, that you might have to get a cherrie picker to reach them	15
27909	4445	I know im a little off topic now but it is part of what im going to talk about	16
27910	4445	Their are massive libraries and small liebrareis	17
27911	4445	Its almost like the difference between pre- school and college	18
27912	4445	Now that is a big difference	19
27913	4445	What i think the cities that have a bigger population should consist of two libraries side buy side	20
27914	4445	The one on the left would be for todlers ranging from @NUM5 -@NUM6.this library will be buissy alot	21
27915	4445	The library will consist of a day care so parents can look for a book in complet silence	22
27916	4445	The cidren at the ages of @NUM7- @DATE1 will also be in the librarie on the left,but upstars.They will have books made just for their age ranges	23
27917	4445	The will also be capabull of watch t.v	24
27918	4445	or playing minor games that dont posses violents on the computer	25
27919	4445	The librarie on the right will look like a duplicate of the one on the left but is completly different on the inside	26
27920	4445	The reason the would do that is so kides would not try to get in because it looks cooler than the other	27
27921	4445	Our children look up to us in lots of differnt ways	28
27922	4445	Some @MONTH1 inlude coping our every move	29
27923	4445	So when they see what you watch, listin to, and even read	30
27924	4445	they might want to do that too	31
27925	4445	Know what i think most of you have learned from this is how to keep your children same	32
27926	4445	I dont mean like they are getting hurt or anything, but helps keep them grouing up and not knowing about things they shoiuldent at age @NUM8	33
27927	4445	So, once again, I would like to let you know that we can fix this	34
27928	4445	We want to keep your children away from the bad things	35
27929	4446	No I do not believe that certain materials should not be remove from the shelves because I dont see how they are offensive to other people	0
27930	4446	Even if its war movies its telling what these men have gone through and they fought and lost there friends	1
27931	4446	You just dont see people just killing and shooting you see the emoutions of the men and its emoution to you to see that	2
27932	4446	Every book in there should stay there because some people need it for a project or to study about that person and a lot of books has lots of history that you can learn from	3
27933	4446	The only thing that I think that should be remove is the music because if its rap or anything like that should not be allow in libraries, it brings hatered and often killing to the country and that should not be allowed	4
27934	4446	Some Magazines should be allowed like raceing, sports, or military but all of the other bad stuff should stay out because if they do see, the kind of stuff that shouldnt be seen it will get into there mind	5
27935	4446	Thats what I think about this whole idea	6
27936	4447	There are all kinds of books, movies, and even magazines out there	0
27937	4447	Most libraries have a huge selection for all types of readers or people who would like to watch a movie	1
27938	4447	They could even have stuff that the young minds should not read	2
27939	4447	Have you ever thought about what would happen if a little kid grabbed onto something that he/she was not supposed to read	3
27940	4447	When it comes to things like this, there is a huge range of topics	4
27941	4447	Some of them are not supposed to be looked at until an older age	5
27942	4447	Thats why I think there should be a certain section where only a certain amount of ages are allowed to go	6
27943	4447	When it comes to books, there will always be some books that are not apporbiate for the young mind	7
27944	4447	They could include multiple things that could scar a kid for life	8
27945	4447	Some of the things that they might read are probably things that their parents would like to talk to them about later on in the future	9
27946	4447	Books are great for learning, dont get me wrong, but there are some that are more adult related	10
27947	4447	Now there are a ton of books that kids can read and parents won't need to worry about them reading	11
27948	4447	Another way libraries can help is put the movies in a certain section	12
27949	4447	The library could make a section called 'family and kids'	13
27950	4447	This section would hold a perfect spot where parents wouldn't have to worry about their kids getting the wrong ideas from movies	14
27951	4447	In our library, we have this section	15
27952	4447	My grandma and I would always go there and find an incredible family movie to watch together	16
27953	4447	Finding a great family movie to watch is the best feeling ever	17
27954	4447	Finally the last way a library could help is by making sure the child is old enough to check out a book or a movie	18
27955	4447	Clearly a child of @NUM1 shouldn't check out a movie that is rated @CAPS1, thats just wrong	19
27956	4447	Libraries should make sure the child is at the correct age to check out the movie	20
27957	4447	Thats why the movie companys rate movies, so they can give people heads up about whats good and bad about the movie	21
27958	4447	Also the libraries should make sure a kid is checking out the apporbiate type of magazine or book	22
27959	4447	The people that work there could look through it before and make sure its the right type of book they should read	23
27960	4447	There are an infinte amount of ways we can protect the minds of young ones	24
27961	4447	I dont think libraries should banned books, magazines, movies, or even music	25
27962	4447	I think they should just make sure the kids are checking out what their allowed to read	26
27963	4447	Books are a great way to learn things, but they should be learning about the stuff that is sustable for their age	27
27964	4447	Libraries are there for us to learn and enjoy ourselves	28
27965	4447	I believe people would get upset if they would banned the stuff they love	29
27966	4447	They should just keep an eye out of what kids are looking at	30
27967	4447	Thank you for your time.	31
27968	4448	The last thing I would want my children seeing in a @CAPS1 is offensive material	0
27969	4448	a @CAPS1 is thought of as a learning zone	1
27970	4448	Somewhere for people to learn about new things and expand their knowldge	2
27971	4448	If there are dirty magazines, movies on sexuality, offensive music or inappropriate websites available to children it completely defeats the purpose of having a safe learning enviornment	3
27972	4448	My opinion is that libraries should be used primarily for educational purposes	4
27973	4448	That means that there should be appropriate books and magazines that are also age appropriate	5
27974	4448	Computers are also a great resource but can contain many offensive material	6
27975	4448	My standpoint on this issue is that the computers in the @CAPS1 should be monitored	7
27976	4448	If someone wants to look up inappropraite images and websites, then they should do it on their own time, in the privacy of their own home	8
27977	4448	It should not be allowed in public where innocent children will be exposed to it	9
27978	4448	That isn't fair to the kids, and it isn't fair to the parents who have tried to protect them from that kind of suggestive material	10
27979	4448	I'm sure that there are many people out there that would disagree with my proposal	11
27980	4448	However those @MONTH1 be the type of people who aren't morally structured as I, or those who don't have kids to look out for	12
27981	4448	Or perhaps they just aren't as concerned about the issue	13
27982	4448	They will argue that there is really no severe need for the computers to be monitored, or that they have blocked websites	14
27983	4448	Yes, they @MONTH1 think that there is no real harm	15
27984	4448	But that @MONTH1 just be because that is the way they were raised, causing them to think in that same respect	16
27985	4448	With the magazines, some @MONTH1 argue that children will be exposed to suggestive material sometime, so why not now	17
27986	4448	But if everyone were to start thinking like this all morals would be forgotten	18
27987	4448	In some cases morality might not be the issue at all	19
27988	4448	In fact, religion might be the most important issue	20
27989	4448	A lot of people are religious and their particular religion @MONTH1 be against looking at suggestive and 'unholy' material	21
27990	4448	Parents will not want to walk into a @CAPS1 with their children and find them starting at images that go against what they believe in	22
27991	4448	They will think of it as losing their child's innocense	23
27992	4448	Having these things out in the open and accessable to kids and teenagers could unintentionally send a message to them that indulging in sexual activities is acceptable when according to their religion it is not	24
27993	4448	When I was a little girl I remember going to the @CAPS1 often with my mother to pick out books for school	25
27994	4448	I distinctly remember seeing naughty magazines laying across a table as I was walking toward the children's section	26
27995	4448	My mother was appauled that they had those laying out in the open like that, and especially right next to where the children's books were	27
27996	4448	She complained to one of the librarians and asked that they please remove them	28
27997	4448	The librarian apologized and agreed that the placement of the magazines was a little out of line	29
27998	4448	Ever since then my mom has been a little sceptical and dreads going to that @CAPS1	30
27999	4448	I suppose that is why I am so involved in this issue and the reason for this informative article	31
28000	4448	I did not write this to place blame on anyone or to judge people for their beliefs	32
28001	4448	On the contrary, the purpose for my writing this was to inform general public of these issues and to explain my side of the arguement	33
28002	4448	I don't see the reason of having these materials on hand at a @CAPS1 where almost anyone has access to them	34
28003	4448	I do not understand the need for them to be obtainable at a @CAPS1, or if there is a need at all	35
28004	4448	I'm hoping that by reading this I have opened the eyes of some concerned parents out there, or have at least made them aware of the matter	36
28005	4448	Thank you for your time	37
28006	4448	Sincerely, @PERSON1	38
28007	4449	How would you like it if someone took a book away from you, just because it had @CAPS1 language or nasty meaning	0
28008	4449	I mean of course there are certain books that should be censored, but in doing so you exclude @CAPS1 great novels from the past	1
28009	4449	These novels were acceptable back then	2
28010	4449	If you want to censor boks do so in your own library	3
28011	4449	Personaly, I don't believe in the censorship of books	4
28012	4449	It the author meant to write the book that way then the writing should stay that exact way	5
28013	4449	Censoring destroys books and the learning curriculum of multiple students	6
28014	4449	You would censor a school book if it had @CAPS1 graphic text between its covers	7
28015	4449	There are tons of books that have bad language and perverse ideas	8
28016	4449	These books were penned to educate our civilization	9
28017	4449	If you take away those books, then you will be harming our societies ability to learn	10
28018	4449	Books, I believe should not be offensive unless your a self-conscious person	11
28019	4449	Reading a book is a delightful experience, it shouldn't be marred by censorships	12
28020	4449	In my personal experience, I have had no problem reading a exquisit novel that has @CAPS1 minor graphic details	13
28021	4449	I do not care if there is a explicit word in my reading	14
28022	4449	Albeit, @CAPS1 neive persons have it in there will to remove offensive articles, not for public good, but for personal gain	15
28023	4449	These offensive tactics are a disgrace to literature and culture	16
28024	4449	@CAPS1 of the books writen in today's world are far less explicit then before	17
28025	4449	Thus, we would be creating that unwanted barrier	18
28026	4449	When the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 burned the @CAPS4 books, we almost lost a whole civilizations culture and literature	19
28027	4449	This should never happen to today's literature	20
28028	4449	If we censor the books in our libraries, then we will be loosing a certain aspect of our culture	21
28029	4449	The censorship of the articles of reading in our libraries should be kept to personal libraries and only to personal libraries	22
28030	4449	The libraries are public for a reason	23
28031	4449	In conclusion, Censorship should not be placed in libraries because it disrupts the public literature	24
28032	4449	If the books were meant to be read that way, then so be it	25
28033	4449	We are not the destroyer of classic literature, and it should never come to that.	26
28034	4450	I do not belive that they should be takein off the shelfs beacuse @CAPS1 people still come to get that sort of stuff	0
28035	4450	@CAPS1 people say is not plite for little kids 'well keek your kids away from it then.'             @CAPS1 people dont like it and @CAPS1 people do	1
28036	4450	I am one of the people that like that kind of stuff, beacuse no one can tell us what we can and cant watch or say	2
28037	4450	It is our life if we wanna watch that kind of stuff or read about it we can	3
28038	4450	Noone is telling people that they half to read it or even look at it	4
28039	4450	If you dont like it dont look at it	5
28040	4450	@CAPS2 kind of stuff should be off to the side where you know what your goin to look at and away from kids                       @CAPS2 shouldnt even be a problem	6
28041	4450	@CAPS2 is just people that think they are high class and think if you look at that or watch that or read that you are a dirt bag	7
28042	4450	That is there opinon	8
28043	4450	In conclusion  I think if you dont read @CAPS2 stuff or watch @CAPS2 stuff you are trying to be something you are not	9
28044	4450	Trying to act better than every cause your to high class to read something like that	10
28045	4450	We all get a laugh out of @CAPS2 kind of stuff.	11
28046	4451	In my opinion, books that @MONTH1 seem offensive to someone should be kept on the shelf	0
28047	4451	Meaning that people should be allowed to check them out in the library and read them even if some people think those books in particular are offensive, or @MONTH1 come off as offensive	1
28048	4451	A person should be able to read an article without feeling like somone wrote that book, article, or magazine to be offensive	2
28049	4451	Yes, but at the same time it is up to you, the reader, to pick a book that does and will not make you feel uncomfortable	3
28050	4451	Do not pick a book to read that discriminates against football players if you are a football player, because most likely it is going to upset you, or make you uncomfortable	4
28051	4451	Well say you want to read a book that discriminates against football players, and it does make you feel uncomfortable, do not take the book, and go complain to someone about how the book, or article makes you feel if you picked it out to begin with	5
28052	4451	If it makes you uncomfortable, put the book, or article down	6
28053	4451	No one is forcing you to read it or look at it	7
28054	4451	People should be allowed to read whatever type of books they would like, and about anything that interests them	8
28055	4451	Just because an article, or book is offensive to you, does not mean it is offensive to other people	9
28056	4451	If we were to take all the books, articles, magazines off the shelfs of library's there would not be any books left for us to read because every book written offends at least one person	10
28057	4451	Movies are a whole other issue in itself	11
28058	4451	There are many types of movies, and within those types of movies are types of things people do in the movies to make it funny, scary, shocking, stupid, etc	12
28059	4451	If you do not cuss and say you go watch '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a cuss word	13
28060	4451	If you do not like @CAPS4 people jump out of strange places and scare the crap out of you, then you are not going to watch '@CAPS3.' @CAPS4 people find movies offensive or not to their liking the usually go and try to make a big deal out of it, and sue the people who made the movie	14
28061	4451	You doing that is causing more trouble than it is actually worth	15
28062	4451	The same thing with movies as books, if we were to take all the movies out of movie stores, and just stores in general that were offensive to at least one person in any way, we would not have any movies left to watch because at the end of the day	16
28063	4451	there are tons of movies that would offend some people, and make them uncomfortable	17
28064	4451	In conclusion, if you find a movie, song, book, article, or magazine that is offensive to you, get over it	18
28065	4451	Keep that book or whatever it is out of your reach and in other peoples, because at the end of the day no one is going to help you sue an author, producer, or music production company because something they wrote, directed, or sung offends you	19
28066	4451	In my opinion you should just read what interests you, watch what you like, and listen to the songs you usually listen to	20
28067	4452	Should books,music,magazines, etc., be removed form shelves that are found offensive	0
28068	4452	Everyone has their own oppion on that question	1
28069	4452	In my years of reading I have read a few books that were questionable	2
28070	4452	I wouldn't say someone else couldn't relate to it	3
28071	4452	Personaly i don't think anything should be removed from the shelves	4
28072	4452	While growning up our parents try to keep us from things, at that point in life don't need to see	5
28073	4452	I can agree with age limit but you can't hide everything	6
28074	4452	Isn't it best to let the children know whats out there before you just letting them go to find out on there own	7
28075	4452	You would probably get multiple answers to that question	8
28076	4452	My personal views @MONTH1 be different from the person sitting bestide me, but I think you should be able to have the right to read, see, and litsen to what you want	9
28077	4452	The world is not a safe place, its scary and mean to the people	10
28078	4452	When I raise my children, when they're younger there will be certin things that they wont know and wont see	11
28079	4452	But thats just part of raising your kids, when they get older and start asking quesions i'm going to answer with the truth	12
28080	4452	Is keeping these things from our children lying to them	13
28081	4452	I would have to say yes to that question	14
28082	4452	By taking these things away from the youth we are telling them that its not out there, that the world is perfect and there is no wrong	15
28083	4452	Some people would actually say that, but I have to say to them that they haven't lived	16
28084	4452	Still to this day there is segregation to all people not just against races but in our own race itself	17
28085	4452	To conclude my oppion I would have to say that we should be free to read and see what we want	18
28086	4452	We shouldn't, not let anyone see it and them and then let them out in the world, and have a complete culture shock	19
28087	4452	Teach your children whats out there, let them know the truth about the world	20
28088	4452	Should certain materials be removed from shelves	21
28089	4452	No, @CAPS1 is to judge what we see and hear?	22
28090	4453	Children all around the world find themselves wandering through the library every day	0
28091	4453	These children are exploring the literature world to learn and grow	1
28092	4453	The library @CAPS2 a wonderful place with many genres of literature such as children books, nonfiction books, fiction books, adult books, movies, etc	2
28093	4453	There are certain genres for certain age groups, and there are a lot of materials in libraries that parents do @CAPS1 want their children to even hear the name	3
28094	4453	I think that it @CAPS2 normal for parents to feel this way but it @CAPS2 @CAPS1 neccesary	4
28095	4453	Children should have the right to explore the literature world however they want	5
28096	4453	Reading different types of literature @CAPS2 a terrific way of learning and library shelves should @CAPS1 be stripped of the books occupying the space	6
28097	4453	There are many different types of books, movies, magazines, and music on the shelves in a library	7
28098	4453	These are all great forms of literature and a way of learning different things	8
28099	4453	Although, there are a lot of parents who do @CAPS1 want there children 'exposed' so such materials	9
28100	4453	If a child want's to read a book, let he or she read it for crying out loud	10
28101	4453	Parents might say that it @CAPS2 'corrupting' their child but, books and music don't corrupt children, it's the environment and people around them that have said ability to cause such corruption	11
28102	4453	It @CAPS2 a very normal thing for a parent to be protective of his or her child, but to a certain extent	12
28103	4453	A parent @CAPS2 supposed to help their child grow and learn right from wrong	13
28104	4453	They have every right to protect their child from dangers in the world, but @CAPS1 to keep them from learning the art of literature	14
28105	4453	They're @CAPS1 supposed to sheild their child from all the faults the world has, even if it @CAPS2 a book	15
28106	4453	Literature in every form @CAPS2 a great way of learning	16
28107	4453	Libraries shouldn't have to strip the shelves of wonderful books crated in the literature world for one's entertainment or learning	17
28108	4453	If a child want's to read a book they should have every right to read that book	18
28109	4453	They should be able to explore however they desire.	19
28110	4455	Libraries, they are everywhere and all together they contain millions of books that influence everyone who reads them	0
28111	4455	Whether a book is being read about @PERSON1 or the @CAPS1 there is always something influential to be read	1
28112	4455	Some books have more adult themes or references to certain subjects which most adults find inappropriate for readers of certain ages	2
28113	4455	The question is, is it a good idea for those books that are now being censored to be taken off the shelves	3
28114	4455	In personal opinion	4
28115	4455	yes those types of books are influential, yes it is possible that it could negatively effect the youth of @DATE1, but everyone has the right to read what interests them	5
28116	4455	Being influential is one of the main priorities of most reading materials	6
28117	4455	There is a point to be proven or a side story to be shared within most books	7
28118	4455	Is this a bad thing	8
28119	4455	Is it 'bad' to explain a point of view or to explain a life experience	9
28120	4455	No, having experiences is only half the point of living	10
28121	4455	sharing it is the rest	11
28122	4455	The @ORGANIZATION1 explains one of the more major downfalls in @LOCATION1 and how it brutally effected the people struggling for life and money	12
28123	4455	Twilight shows the softer side of love and that anyone can be happy if they set their hearts on someone	13
28124	4455	These are not only experiences but things to ponder upon, and losing these factors in life would be a horrible mistake	14
28125	4455	The youth of @DATE1 is portrayed in mostly a negative light	15
28126	4455	Whether they are considered monsters or maybe even the devils offspring	16
28127	4455	our youth need influences	17
28128	4455	Reading is one of the major sources of inspiration for students to grow and prosper	18
28129	4455	Most students find reading to be boring	19
28130	4455	In school you are not offered what you want to read	20
28131	4455	Lists are made, and guidelines are created so that only certain things are read and taught	21
28132	4455	Young adults need creativity and books are there to shine a light on their eager minds	22
28133	4455	Taking away the books students and young adults are interested in is one of the many growing problems contributing to people not wanting to read	23
28134	4455	Teachers, principals, business men, and even children deserve the right to reading what they like	24
28135	4455	If you were a sports major and suddenly the population decided sports journals and sports themselves were too harmful and badly influential to people	25
28136	4455	what would you do when suddenly everything sports related was taken away	26
28137	4455	You would lose your career	27
28138	4455	Romance novelists use sensual or even sexual experiences to convey something everyone has trembling inside their minds	28
28139	4455	Taking away something that is related to something so natural in every day life would have severe reprocussions	29
28140	4455	especially for those who greatly enjoy those books	30
28141	4455	Revoking the rights to the literary works of thousands of authors would also take away an intellectual culture that is conveyed	31
28142	4455	Influencing people to think about things that are viewed by everyone is not a bad thing when it can be used to inspire people in their lives	32
28143	4455	Just because someone is a student or a child doesn't mean that a literary work could rot their mind	33
28144	4455	Taking away something that can contribute to the every day art of life would slowly create a less creative, inventive, and inspired world	34
28145	4455	Not everyone believes that certain books are bad, and i, am one of those  thousands of people.	35
28146	4456	Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and etc., be removed from sheleves if they are found offensive	0
28147	4456	Should them magazines and etc., but put up in a place for that age group	1
28148	4456	Should them type of things but in the @CAPS1 with children	2
28149	4456	Should they be in @CAPS1's period	3
28150	4456	I thing that the @CAPS1 should have all type of books in there because that's what a @CAPS1 is for	4
28151	4456	But I do think that if people are finding it offensive to have them type of books open to children they should ask the @CAPS1 to change how they have the books	5
28152	4456	But I also think the @CAPS1 should put them book up in a part were they have adult things and book at	6
28153	4456	Because them type of book isn't made for children eyes	7
28154	4456	The @CAPS1 should put people ages on the @CAPS1 cards so that this want be a problem to the poeple or the @CAPS1	8
28155	4456	Because then you would no how old they are 	9
28156	4456	And only @NUM1 years of age can she the books and magnizines, etc., that isn't right for young children eyes	10
28157	4456	But I Do think that it is offensive to people that have young children and there children are reading it 	11
28158	4456	And it is offensive to the people that just dont like what the book, music and magazines stand for	12
28159	4456	One thing I don't agree on is that books should be taking off the shelves because there are so people that comes to the @CAPS1 just to read them books	13
28160	4456	And the people who read them books are going to be upset that you took the books off the shelves	14
28161	4456	Because me personal I like the magnizes, books , music and the movies and I don't find nothing offensive about them	15
28162	4456	And I like the movies to because it gives me somthing to do and watch when I am at home	16
28163	4456	I also think that the movies and music is something we all love that's in the @CAPS1	17
28164	4456	Because it give me and my friends something to do after school	18
28165	4456	So if you take away the thing we like what will we have to do after school when we go to the @CAPS1	19
28166	4456	And the thing's that was named make the @CAPS1 so fun an peaceful	20
28167	4456	The @CAPS1 is a place were you can come and whine your day down	21
28168	4456	With out them thing there trying to take of the shelves it's going to be boring	22
28169	4456	People who don't have nothing to do doing the day come to the @CAPS1 and look for that offensive stuff.	23
28170	4457	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed	0
28171	4457	People should have the choice to read or watch whatever they want to	1
28172	4457	Just becuase one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean that another person will also find it offensive	2
28173	4457	The libray's need to let the community deem what they find offensive or not	3
28174	4457	Some parents say that they do not want bad or certain materials in the library becuase their children might read it	4
28175	4457	If parents are that concerned about what their children see, then  they should sit down with their child and discuss why they should not be able to read or watch that type of material	5
28176	4457	Parents should be able to make their children understand why they shouldn't read or watch the certain material instead of accusing the library's themselves just for having the material	6
28177	4457	If some books or movies are deemed very offensive by public, then they should be placed in a special area	7
28178	4457	This special area should be clearly marked with a sign that says '@CAPS1 content' and should only be able to be viewed by adults	8
28179	4457	This would solve many problems such as children being able to check out certain materials	9
28180	4457	Doing this would grant the people who wish to see this type of material access to the material	10
28181	4457	This would also solve a problem becuase it would be in a back corner or area that not many people go to so children will not very easily see it	11
28182	4457	The best solution to this problem would still allow the library's to put certain material that are found offensive in their library's	12
28183	4457	But instead put age restrictions to being able to check out the material and also putting it in a differnet section of the library than the normal material	13
28184	4458	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
28185	4458	I understand that some parents wouldn't want their kids reading a book about drugs or watching a movie about gangs, but libraries shouldn't have to remove them from their shelves	1
28186	4458	There is not one movie, book, or magazine where everyone will approve of it	2
28187	4458	Just because a couple of people find it offensive doesn't mean they should have the power to determine what materials libraries have or don't have on their shelves	3
28188	4458	One reason why I believe certain items shouldn't be removed from a library just because a couple of people find it offensive is because what Katherine Paterson said in her quote	4
28189	4458	She is saying if there was a book a couple of parents didn't want their kids to see and they were to complain and have the right to remove it from the libraries shelf	5
28190	4458	Then sooner or later, more and more parents will be coming in complaining about a different book, movie, or magazine every other day	6
28191	4458	Soon, there wouldn't be any books, movies, magazines in the library	7
28192	4458	Another reason why I believe we should have no say in what items libraries hold is this	8
28193	4458	As you know, there is many different cultural familes living in the @LOCATION1	9
28194	4458	Some people say bibles should be allowed in libraries	10
28195	4458	Half the population agrees on that statement, the other half thinks that is ridiculous and they're thinking how they would even suggest doing such a thing	11
28196	4458	How would a library handle this situation	12
28197	4458	If we gave people the right to decide what was held in libraries	13
28198	4458	There would be a group of people walking in there and saying they don't believe in @CAPS1 so they must take those bibles off the shelf before their children read it	14
28199	4458	Then, as soon as the believers in @CAPS1 hear about it	15
28200	4458	They would come to that library and complain about them actually taking that off the shelves	16
28201	4458	There would be no way in pleasing everyone, so the libraries should be able to put whatever they want on their shelves	17
28202	4458	My third and final reason why I think the public should have no say in this matter is if libraries were forced to take items off their shelves just because a couple people complain about certain books or movies	18
28203	4458	Then why couldn't people do that at restaurants, or movie rental business, or outlet stores with clothes they don't approve	19
28204	4458	If it was to happen to one business, then it should happen to every business and in my perspective	20
28205	4458	The only person who should have the say in what they have in their store/library is the person who is paying for it and that is the owner	21
28206	4458	It's their responsibility to know what's too far concerning movies or books, etc	22
28207	4458	The public has to accept those choices	23
28208	4458	You have to look at it from their view	24
28209	4458	Would you want them to come into your business and start complaining and then you are forced to get rid of that item because of them	25
28210	4458	It's just not the right way to handle things	26
28211	4458	After reading all those opinions of mine, I would hope that you see where I'm coming from and you see that it just wouldn't be humane to do that	27
28212	4458	It's never been that way and it should never be that way	28
28213	4458	Obviously parents don't want their kids to see things inappropiate	29
28214	4458	But it's not our say and we just have to face the fact that's the way it should be	30
28215	4459	Today, we live in a world where there are many different political, religious and personal views	0
28216	4459	and with time, these views are only going to become more varied and more wide spread	1
28217	4459	Unfortunately, it is not always easy to cater to every single persons individual takes on the world	2
28218	4459	When it comes to libraries, it is even harder to have different books for all the different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions	3
28219	4459	Let's take @LOCATION1 for example	4
28220	4459	There are many different races and people with different religions living here	5
28221	4459	This is a place that has already been through a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and has fought against racism and slavery	6
28222	4459	Although these are things that our country has overcome, there are still going to be arguments and disagreements over these problems	7
28223	4459	When there are different opinions, there are always going to be different books out there about the same topic from multiple points of view	8
28224	4459	As the readers of these books we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs	9
28225	4459	This is where the offensiveness comes from	10
28226	4459	We live with many different people and we need to understand that not everyone is going to have the same views on life that we do	11
28227	4459	When I was in eighth grade, I was @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 with some friends	12
28228	4459	One of them was pulling her eyes back (like someone would do if they were imitating an @CAPS3 person) because they were itchy	13
28229	4459	A very pregnant @CAPS3 @CAPS5 woman walked in and took offense to my friends eye movements	14
28230	4459	She yelled @CAPS6 us and said, 'I would have thought your parents raised you better than that.' @CAPS6 first, we did not understand what this woman was talking about until we realized that our friend had been pulling her eyes back	15
28231	4459	This showed us that different people can take offense to different things because of their heritage	16
28232	4459	There is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country	17
28233	4459	We cannot change the views of certain people in order to match those of our own beliefs nor can we change the fact that all the different people are going to voice their opinions and view them as 'right'	18
28234	4459	However, we can change the way that we view these people	19
28235	4459	We need to understand that there is no 'right' when you are dealing with multiple opinions	20
28236	4459	@CAPS6 this point we need to embrace everyone else for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs	21
28237	4459	So next time you pick up a book @CAPS6 the library, read the summary and check to see that the author agrees with you before you take the book home or there are going to be disagreements in your views	22
28238	4459	If you get a book and you don't agree with it or if you are offended by it, there is no one to be mad @CAPS6 but yourself for not checking to see the author's stance on the topic before you started reading it	23
28239	4460	I strongly feel that every book was created for people to read and gain knowledge, on what every aspect of what the book is	0
28240	4460	If your children are looking at things they should not be looking at, you should keep you child away from that section	1
28241	4460	Every person has a different style of book's that they like to read, they should not have to lose those book's because children are looking at things their not supose to	2
28242	4460	What would be the point in a library if you can not have certain materials in side it	3
28243	4460	My view on censorship in libraries would have to be that those bad sections should be off limits to childeren	4
28244	4460	All libraries are divided up in to different sections like	5
28245	4460	fiction, non- fiction, fantasy, children's books	6
28246	4460	Those sections were created for a reason	7
28247	4460	If people choose to let their children read books then that is fine with me	8
28248	4460	Although those parents that do not approve of this can go to a different library	9
28249	4460	I feel that if that one parent complains and no one else has that they should not be allowed in that library anymore	10
28250	4460	I do not beleive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be excluded  from a library	11
28251	4460	Just because, a person does not appreciate their child picking up a book they should not have	12
28252	4460	I feel that parents should be responsiable for what their kid's are looking at, and not make libraries take books off their shelves	13
28253	4460	Everything from books to movies were put in the libraries for educational reasons	14
28254	4460	Their should be  laws that say those things are put into a library for a certain reason, and if customers do not like that they can go some where's else	15
28255	4460	My own experience being a volunteer at a local library is that there are many things that were put into a libray for a reason	16
28256	4460	Every movie, book, and magazine have information about something that you @MONTH1 want to know	17
28257	4460	Books are put in  libraries for people's pleasure and love for reading	18
28258	4460	All those types of books are made from people that find excitement in reading	19
28259	4460	Movies at a library are put their for educational reason  like: to teach kids to count, and to learn something about a certain topic	20
28260	4460	Magazines could just be in a  library for people to read and relax, and learn something new in the world	21
28261	4460	I really feel that parent's should watch what their children are reading, you should think the same	22
28262	4460	Library's should not have to remove books from their shelves that have been there for a really long time	23
28263	4460	Materials like movies, books, magazines, and music should never be taken away from a library	24
28264	4460	What would be the point in having a library around if you could not go check a book , movie or cd out that interest's you	25
28265	4460	After reading this should feel the same, that certain thing should not be removed from a library because parent's do not know how to watch their children	26
28266	4461	Have you ever seen a book or magazine on a shelf that looked offensive	0
28267	4461	Say, maybe some sort of book that highly deals with drugs, alcohol or even sex	1
28268	4461	Well, some parents don't want their kids to 'accidently' pick up this book and read it	2
28269	4461	It could scar them mentally for life	3
28270	4461	Offensive books are not meant for kids or even some kids in the early teens	4
28271	4461	They are too young to learn about drugs, alcohol and/or sex	5
28272	4461	If a kid picks up a book about sex, which I highly doubt would be on a library shelf, what would they say to their parents	6
28273	4461	'@CAPS1, look what I found.' is exactly what the kid would say and show the book to their parent	7
28274	4461	The parent, in shock, could sue the library for having such an offensive book	8
28275	4461	However, some @CAPS2 do not find books like that on library shelves offensive	9
28276	4461	It might 'provide' good information for their lives or even someone else's life	10
28277	4461	@CAPS2 are the ones who should be reading those kinds of books, not their children	11
28278	4461	It can and will mentally scar them for life	12
28279	4461	The library could do simple things, like for example: they could make a room just for @CAPS2 and have the offensive movies/books/magazines, ect in there	13
28280	4461	Kids can't enter unless they are @NUM1 or older	14
28281	4461	That could be a good idea because their children wouldn't be picking up those kinds of offensive books and it will keep their mind safer	15
28282	4461	Us children are always curious to know things, especially when we are growing up	16
28283	4461	We'll ask about drugs, alcohol and even sex when the time is right	17
28284	4461	But for the library to have things like that on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and other @CAPS2	18
28285	4461	The library staff should take action and make a separate room for @CAPS2 @CAPS3	19
28286	4462	I believe censorship is necessary	0
28287	4462	If all of the kids in the world grew up listening to hardcore gangster rap and watching porn @DATE1 we would have shiftless and violent leaders tomorrow	1
28288	4462	It's inmportant that we are held back some what by these offensive outlets in order that we grow into mentally healthy adults	2
28289	4462	However, censorship can go to far	3
28290	4462	When it comes to the removing an author's work from a public library altogether, we have crossed the line	4
28291	4462	With the @CAPS2 given us by our founding fathers, our @CAPS2 given to us at birth, and the duty we have to express our opinion, I submit that it is a crime to remove the hardwork of authors and artists from the shelves	5
28292	4462	Of course the first point of argument that comes to mind to defend my postion is the fact that we are all given a legal right to express oursleves through the @NUM1 amendment of our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2	6
28293	4462	The writers of this @CAPS1 were aware that freedom of creativity should not be held back from the people	7
28294	4462	That law still exists @DATE1 and has been used many times to defend people arguing to keep their work, their words, and their ideas out in the world	8
28295	4462	As far as I know, taking any form of media, book, or entertainment away from the general public would be illegal	9
28296	4462	Still, even with this point made, some @MONTH1 not be convinced that we are allowed to say what we want	10
28297	4462	A man by the name of @PERSON4 comes to my mind when asked about censorship in the media	11
28298	4462	@PERSON4 was a musician, composer, writer, public speaker, and human @CAPS2 activist	12
28299	4462	I think many people believe him to be a bit too wild and deranged to be a convincing argument	13
28300	4462	@PERSON4 was known to be a firm athiest and secular humanist (one who believes that there is nothing more important than the physical human body), but he gave the same argument I'm giving @DATE1, and I'm a catholic	14
28301	4462	@PERSON4 spoke out against censorship, saying that it was a way to judge artists on their work when it wasn't even listened to fully	15
28302	4462	If someone as convincing and passionate as @PERSON4 could feel that way when he didn't even believe in a @CAPS4, then everyone should see that the human race, whether they believe in a @CAPS4 or not, is given the right for their creation to be revealed	16
28303	4462	In some cases, it's necessary and needed for people to show their ideas to the public	17
28304	4462	@PERSON1, @PERSON2, @PERSON3 even, and the list goes on	18
28305	4462	These people, although from different worlds and different times and different people, were all avid believers in the @CAPS2 of humans	19
28306	4462	Imagine if @CAPS3 had just said, 'I don't think people want to hear me so I'll just stop and let someone else take over for a little bit.' Do you think the world would by as amazing and of intergrated as a place	20
28307	4462	The point is, we never know how great and life-changing someone's point of view could be	21
28308	4462	Whether it's leading a civil @CAPS2 movement, or attempting to bring peace to a world that needs it the most, censorship might be the one thing from stopping the people from seeing the most influential person that they need	22
28309	4462	In fact, we are all called to share our ideas	23
28310	4462	It's our duty to make sure people see the world not only from their view, but from the view of a poor homeless man, and from a single mother of five, and from a kid in elementary school, and from a rebellious teenager	24
28311	4462	The world might not be ready for change, but it needs it	25
28312	4462	Who's right is it to judge an artist's work	26
28313	4462	Some call him @CAPS4, some call him the man, and others call him the government	27
28314	4462	It's hard getting your work acknowledged by someone, let alone a whole nation	28
28315	4462	However, that doesn't mean we are to just give up	29
28316	4462	Censorship in public places is a crime against the law, nature, and our inaliable @CAPS2, and it's our job to go out into the world to create a new one.	30
28317	4463	Censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society	0
28318	4463	Wanting to take and hide even the smallest of discreet history, politic corruption, and inappropriate sights to a generation can turn them all ignorant and unaware of their past, present, and possibly future	1
28319	4463	Censorship is extremely dangerous to a soceity because it leaves them vulnerable to the future	2
28320	4463	For example, if people tried to censor @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and many other environmentalist around the globe of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 possibility, then the world would not be able to have the chance to stop or at least slow the upcoming disaster by going green	3
28321	4463	Instead, we would most likely die a few hundred years before that deadline	4
28322	4463	Also, maybe if more people knew about @PERSON2's censorship of his oil distribution among the @LOCATION2 (during his presidency) people might have at least discussed of impeachment	5
28323	4463	Try to think how the future would have been if racism, terrorism, wars, or even an event like the holocaust were censored	6
28324	4463	That could be taken as brainwashing	7
28325	4463	Even though that @MONTH1 cause peace and happiness around the world, we still would know nothing of our history leaving us historically, unintellilectual	8
28326	4463	Then think of all the sudden problem it would cause if that information was suddenly found	9
28327	4463	In the book series of 'The @CAPS5' by @PERSON1, a city has been isolated from their past, who they call 'the @CAPS6', and they are basically brainwashed to think that they almost destroyed the world by war and destruction by the new government and their new technology	10
28328	4463	Luckily, in our own era I do not believe we are censored from most things except of course politics going on between other countries	11
28329	4463	For example, the @LOCATION1 bin @CAPS7 killing was nothing of anyones awareness except the @CAPS8 of @ORGANIZATION1, military, and @CAPS9	12
28330	4463	That was a thoughtful choice from @CAPS10 as well instead of announcing it on @NUM1 news	13
28331	4463	I'd rather of coursebe notified about my history, because it's interesting and it shows why things are now	14
28332	4463	Books like 'To @CAPS11 a @CAPS12' or '@PERSON3' should never be taken off shelves for young pupils or old matures	15
28333	4463	Although it would seem a bit more offensive to hearing a historical racist cocasian singing about negroes than a racist book, I would always be interested in hearing about it	16
28334	4463	Censorship should definitely be illegal itself in libraries, @CAPS13 stores, and any other selling stores of books, music, movies, and/or magazines	17
28335	4463	Although, I have not heard of any recent censorships, but then again should I not be able to	18
28336	4463	It is censorship..	19
28337	4465	This writing is socially unacceptable	0
28338	4465	There are many books and media sources, that include: lauguage, sexual tones, and other immoral things and ideas	1
28339	4465	However culture does need to be obtained, although immorally on this earth is at an all-time high,we need to stop focusing on books that will always be on the sheves and turn our attention to people's hearts, and turn to morally right things	2
28340	4465	When a person walks into a library, @CAPS8 or she can expect certain things, for example: the smell of the older books, the noise of a group of kids, and the yelling of the librarian to keep them quiet.What @CAPS8 or she would not expect is: kids doing drugs, and watching porn on the computers	3
28341	4465	This is not a book's fault or 'the evil computers' fault	4
28342	4465	This is the fault of an immoral world	5
28343	4465	I myself have witnessed some evil things kids do in the school system and it gets worst everyday, there is good, but it certainly is not because they themselves are caring and loving about what they do on this planet	6
28344	4465	I can quote from many, in my @NUM1 grade class that have told me 'The only thing that is wrong, is telling someone they are'	7
28345	4465	This thought process is immoral	8
28346	4465	But who is going to tell them that, and what is the answer	9
28347	4465	@CAPS2 is the answer, in the @CAPS1 it says, @CAPS2 is the way, the truth, and the life.This is truth	10
28348	4465	In the book of @CAPS3 it says, @CAPS4 gave many people over to their sinful passions	11
28349	4465	@CAPS4 is the only good, and the only light comes from @CAPS5	12
28350	4465	The only man to live a perfect life was @CAPS2 @CAPS7 and @CAPS8 was @CAPS4 in a human body	13
28351	4465	we as a planet need to turn to @CAPS5, the only good thing	14
28352	4465	And try to be like @CAPS5, because this world needs @CAPS5	15
28353	4465	Only @CAPS4 can change a heart	16
28354	4465	We need the focus on @CAPS5, once we do that, the way we think, and the way we write, and the way we act, will change and we will not need to disgust this problem any longer	17
28355	4468	Everyone has an opinion	0
28356	4468	Don't you agree	1
28357	4468	That's what makes us different, this is why some of us would rather watch @CAPS1 compared to @CAPS2, or why some want to listen to pop instead of country	2
28358	4468	A library is a place that brings all sorts of people together	3
28359	4468	It's a place of interest and information, a place for research and enjoyment	4
28360	4468	So here is my question: 'Do we really want to remove certain materials from library shelves just because some people find them offensive.'?I don't believe so, as the quote says by the author, Katherine Paterson, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I agree with that statement	5
28361	4468	Think about this, if we allowed people to get rid of the library books they just don't like, if everyone had that right	6
28362	4468	We would have no more books, no materials left to study or pleasure read.I have to admit I've seen things that I don't necessarily agree with, but other people might	7
28363	4468	You can't just have a library all to yourself	8
28364	4468	Something for just your interests and nobody elses	9
28365	4468	That's not what a library is for, millions of people use libraries for different purposes	10
28366	4468	So no I really don't think we should remove items from the shelves	11
28367	4468	Only pick up what you find interresting and leave it at that	12
28368	4468	We all have rights just like we all have likes, dislikes, and minds of our own.Opinions define us, choices shape us, but libraries do so much more, they advance our knowledge, make our dreams a reality, and sometimes even broaden our horizons	13
28369	4468	We need books, music, movies, and even magazines, but we need them all together	14
28370	4468	That's my position on this topic, I hope this helped form yours.	15
28371	4469	Books in libraries are available to everyone, so who's job is it to decide which ones are appropriate and which are not	0
28372	4469	This is a very controversial topic	1
28373	4469	On one side, parents are worried about what their children have access to at local libraries	2
28374	4469	They believe libraries shouldn't contain any books that might be found offensive	3
28375	4469	On the other hand, whose job is it to decide what is offensive and what is not	4
28376	4469	If people are given the right to remove books that they think are not appropriate, eventually libraries will have so few books that it would be worthless to even get a library card	5
28377	4469	I believe that it is the job of parents and other adults to teach a child morals and what is right and wrong	6
28378	4469	If kids have developed morals and values, parents wouldn't have to worry so much about what they're checking out of the local library	7
28379	4469	Kids are faced with issues of right and wrong everyday, and parents should learn to trust that their child is making the right decision	8
28380	4469	As a teenager, I know that people have access to far worse things on the internet than in libraries	9
28381	4469	If people begin to censor libraries, surely they will begin to censor the internet, and the idea of freedom of speech will be thrown out the window	10
28382	4469	People have a right to be heard and share their opinions, and who has the right to say that a person's opinion doesn't matter	11
28383	4469	In my opinion, the act of removing books from a library says just that	12
28384	4469	Just a few months ago I had to write a research paper about the @PERSON1, and in order to find information about the topic, I had to check out books from the library	13
28385	4469	Some of the information I read about the topic was horrible and very offensive, but I couldn't have written my paper without it	14
28386	4469	Books in libraries have information that is vital, whether the books are offensive or not	15
28387	4469	Books can be used to teach people lessons on what is right or wrong	16
28388	4469	By being educated about even the most offensive things, people can learn from them and form their beliefs	17
28389	4469	Removing offensive books from libraries will not lessen the chance that someone's child will run across the information that they contain	18
28390	4469	There are many sources for information, offensive or not, and a library is just one of them	19
28391	4469	People are responsible for their decisions, and it is each individual's choice on what they choose to read, watch, or listen to	20
28392	4469	We are faced with choices everyday	21
28393	4469	Should we watch a movie even though we know it's inappropriate	22
28394	4469	Should we listen to a song even though it gives off a bad message	23
28395	4469	Checking out a book from the library requires the same decision	24
28396	4469	Each person must choose what is right, and it is not our job to tell others what they can and can't do.	25
28397	4470	Yes I do believe that any book found offensive to any person should be removed from the book shelf	0
28398	4470	You have to think about it from the other person's perspective, or put yourself in their shoes	1
28399	4470	Say you went to the library and that certain thing was constantly there or it felt like it was constantly hanging over your head, that would be a tough problem to deal with in your every day visit to the library	2
28400	4470	Also  in your everyday life	3
28401	4470	One reason for this is because if you find a book on a shelf and it offends you and another person knows it affends you then most likely they will use it against you to say mean and harsh things	4
28402	4470	Another reason i believe an offensive book should be removed from the shelf is because what if you are in that place very often	5
28403	4470	I mean if you have to see that book every day dont you think that would start to get on your nerves a little bit	6
28404	4470	So what I am trying to say is I do beleive if there is an offensive book on a shelf remove it	7
28405	4470	Music should not be as much of an issue as books	8
28406	4470	Music is something you listen to or you hear	9
28407	4470	Books are things you read	10
28408	4470	I say music should not be as big of an issue because music you do not see like you do books	11
28409	4470	Books is usally says it right there in black and white	12
28410	4470	Also the posibality of it being right there in front of you in words and a picture	13
28411	4470	So what I am saying here is that if you find something offensive then fix it instead of letting it bother you every day of you life	14
28412	4470	So get it fixed now or just get over what ever you find offensive	15
28413	4471	Books are pieces of art	0
28414	4471	Authors are artists	1
28415	4471	Writing is a form of expression	2
28416	4471	In the @CAPS1 it grants freedom of expression	3
28417	4471	I do not think we should deny anyone that freedom	4
28418	4471	I do not believe books or any other form of art should be removed from the shelves of libraries	5
28419	4471	I understand that parents do not want their children seing or hearing certain things	6
28420	4471	People want to keep children neive, they want them to stay innocent	7
28421	4471	The thing they have to understand is that children need to grow up	8
28422	4471	They will be curious	9
28423	4471	They will want to know	10
28424	4471	They will want to see the world	11
28425	4471	You can not hide things from them	12
28426	4471	I believe in what @PERSON2, my favorite musician, once said '@CAPS2 covering your childrens eyes...' The world can be a bad place and you want to protect them from that, but it can also be beautiful	13
28427	4471	There is so much that children, and just normal people would miss out on if we took down every thing that someone said was 'offensive'	14
28428	4471	Also there is the question of, what is offensive	15
28429	4471	Who decides	16
28430	4471	Where do we draw the line	17
28431	4471	Like Katherine Paterson said, soon we would have no books left on our shelves	18
28432	4471	Because everyone has a different oppinon	19
28433	4471	People can find the most innocent things offensive	20
28434	4471	If you do not want your children reading or hearing certain things, then tell them so	21
28435	4471	Do not ruin it for other people	22
28436	4471	To each his own	23
28437	4471	Different people like different things	24
28438	4471	Something that would be offensive to you could very well be beautiful to someone else	25
28439	4471	'@CAPS3 mans trash is another man's treasure.'     Books, music, movies, they are all art	26
28440	4471	People have the right to express themselves	27
28441	4471	We already censor so much	28
28442	4471	I think when you cencor things it takes away from the original	29
28443	4471	If you do not perticularly like something, then it is your choice to not read it	30
28444	4471	It is your choice to not listen to it	31
28445	4471	You can choose for your children, but you can not choose for others	32
28446	4471	People have a right to do what they want	33
28447	4471	People have a right to do what makes them happy	34
28448	4471	They have a right to read, watch, or listen to what makes them happy	35
28449	4471	They have a right to create what makes them happy	36
28450	4471	You have no right to take that away from someone	37
28451	4471	Books do not kill people	38
28452	4471	Music does not kill people	39
28453	4471	They can make you uncomfortable	40
28454	4471	They can even make you sick or angry, but they do not harm anyone	41
28455	4471	People make decisions	42
28456	4471	People control their own actions	43
28457	4471	Books, videos, art, does not harm people	44
28458	4471	All in all, I do not believe any books, music, movies, or any other forms of art should be romoved from the shelves	45
28459	4471	There could be age limits for certain things, or specific sections for more adult things, but I do not believe any @CAPS3 should have the choice to decide what is right for someone else	46
28460	4471	You can shelter your children if you would like	47
28461	4471	You can avoid things you find offensive	48
28462	4471	But please do not take away an oportunity for another	49
28463	4471	A wonderful book, or a life-changing peice of music could be taken away from someone, because you found it 'offensive'.	50
28464	4472	Books are part of history no book should be censored	0
28465	4472	They show and teach us about history	1
28466	4472	If the book is based on true events nothing should be censored	2
28467	4472	Many books from the @DATE1's and earlier have words that younger children should not see yet	3
28468	4472	With how the human race is everyone is going to hear something bad or even see something	4
28469	4472	Its just like saying all websites should be cenerosed	5
28470	4472	A book that needs to be censored should not be in an @CAPS1 school	6
28471	4472	I would have to say any book that teaches a lesson or helps a teacher should be used no matter the content in it	7
28472	4472	This is why a teacher needs to read the book before assigning it the students	8
28473	4472	If he/she thinks the students will not act apporiate, then the book should not be used in the class room	9
28474	4472	A lot of books would be removed or cenersored from shelves	10
28475	4472	If you do not want to hear those words or see certain images you should not have gotten that book	11
28476	4472	Many people would be made mad if this did happen	12
28477	4472	I would be two because sometimes a whole chapter could be bad or in music a whole lyric could be bad	13
28478	4472	Many people are mad now, but everyone else would be mad if censerorship happened	14
28479	4473	Removing books off of shelves in our public library	0
28480	4473	To me, that sounds crazy	1
28481	4473	I can see how some people might be offended by some books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but some people appreciate it	2
28482	4473	It's diversity, some people love the down-to-earth literature, but some people can't handle it	3
28483	4473	Why take away something that only a few people disagree with	4
28484	4473	I believe some of the best entertainment in libraries are the most offensive, but it is all fact	5
28485	4473	I mean, if this is such a problem there should be a certain section to find those things in	6
28486	4473	If people want to complain then they can get out of that section, because people like me will be in that section ready to learn about all these different varieties of entertainment	7
28487	4473	Whether if it's offensive or not.People @MONTH1 find some of it offensive, but I believe it makes that person stronger	8
28488	4473	It helps them realize how lucky they are that they're not being treated a certain way in the offensive book they're reading	9
28489	4473	It's just a piece of entertainment	10
28490	4473	If it offends you and you're not entertained, go find something that does	11
28491	4473	Even though I hear of people reading offensive books I've never really seen one myself	12
28492	4473	I think some people just get offended too easily	13
28493	4473	That's where we should reason with them instead of giving into their demands	14
28494	4473	So what if they aren't taken off the shelves	15
28495	4473	Like I said, we can make a certain section for them type of things	16
28496	4473	If they aren't happy with the outcome, they will get over it	17
28497	4473	Now that you read what  I had to say, what do yu think	18
28498	4473	Do you think we should remove certain entertainment off of library book shelves	19
28499	4473	Or should we just reason with the people who are offended	20
28500	4473	I hope what you read today helps keep books on the shelves and readers happy!	21
28501	4474	Should we have censorship in our libraries	0
28502	4474	This is a question that both sides can argue with creditable facts	1
28503	4474	However, censhorship is mostly defined as not allowing certain items or things to be seen or heard of until a mature age	2
28504	4474	How can you tell when someone is of a mature age	3
28505	4474	Maturity lies behind one's self to cope with various thoughts, ideas, actions, etc	4
28506	4474	Censorship should be allowed to an extent	5
28507	4474	Censhorship plays a big role in society today	6
28508	4474	It has changed the content on our television from @NUM1 years ago to modern day	7
28509	4474	The government is more leniant today then they were @NUM1 years ago	8
28510	4474	On television @NUM1 years ago, you would never hear a sware word, or see a couple sleep in the same bed	9
28511	4474	Now, some sware words are considered okay, because people can handle them	10
28512	4474	It is like they are part of our daily vocabulary now	11
28513	4474	Censorship has changed a lot	12
28514	4474	Books of all sorts should be allowed to children and adults of all ages	13
28515	4474	Certain literature provides a cornucopia of topics and subjects to be helpful to a processing brain	14
28516	4474	We learn and understand at different rates	15
28517	4474	Some books with 'adult content' @MONTH1 be suitable for more intelligent minds	16
28518	4474	Authors sometimes put in so-called 'adult content' to add suspense and drama towards the bigger picture or message behind their work	17
28519	4474	Books help the mind to expand and gain a higher standard of learning	18
28520	4474	Movies are differnent	19
28521	4474	Some movies have sexual content that our youth should not see	20
28522	4474	Most magazines have the same principles as movies do	21
28523	4474	They are both rated differently on levels of age	22
28524	4474	Therefore, we can protect their innocence and fellow youth	23
28525	4474	Music is healthy to the mood of a person	24
28526	4474	Music should not be censored	25
28527	4474	People just have different tastes in music	26
28528	4474	Some @MONTH1 be fond of other genres and some @MONTH1 dislike the other genres	27
28529	4474	There is a wide array of music that people can enjoy	28
28530	4474	There is no way to censor the universal language that music provides	29
28531	4474	Censorship should come down to what the adult allows for the kid to see and hear	30
28532	4474	Censorship of books is not fine, but censorship of movies and magazines are acceptable	31
28533	4474	Music, however, can not be censored	32
28534	4474	The lyrics and sounds speak to many people in strange ways	33
28535	4474	It is all helpful in the end	34
28536	4474	Everyone should have the right to watch, read, or listen to whatever they want	35
28537	4474	It all comes down to learning, and there is no censorship on learning	36
28538	4474	So, please do not censor our libraries	37
28539	4474	Allow the adults to censor what should be censored in their families	38
28540	4477	How would you feel if someone told you that you couldn't have certain food in your fridge that sence its bad for your health or they might think it taste bad	0
28541	4477	You would not be too happy about it	1
28542	4477	Well its the same thing when people want to censor the libraries	2
28543	4477	When people try to censor the libraries they try to take out books that are 'offensive'	3
28544	4477	If someone that likes those kind of books and they are being taken off	4
28545	4477	Its unfair for that person because they are being limited on what they can get from the libaries	5
28546	4477	Libaries are soppose to be a place where you can get books or magazines that you like to enjoy but they cant do that because people are trying to cencor the books	6
28547	4477	The people that want to cencor certain books say that they might offensive not only to them but they could also for the kids	7
28548	4477	Well I say to that, you don't have to bring your kids to that section	8
28549	4477	You don't have to read those books you can just leave them alone for the people that like reading them	9
28550	4477	To the people that want to cencor certain books what makes a book offencsive	10
28551	4477	Whos to say if that is offensive or not	11
28552	4477	The two views are differnt just because one person thinks its offensive doesnt mean another person thinks the same	12
28553	4477	My opinion is leave the books there and let people enjoy the books they like to read	13
28554	4477	No book is bad every book does good for you because it builds your education, it could also be a stress reliever, and something you like to do on your free time	14
28555	4477	The people that are getting cheated out on the books they like because they are being cencored	15
28556	4477	What if the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series got cencored because of the magic.To some people that might be an offensive book and if that book was taken off the shelve we would lose one of the greatest books and @CAPS3 of people would be upset	16
28557	4477	So the way I see it everyone should be entitled on what books they can choose	17
28558	4477	To the people that don't like certain books just leave them there you don't like to read them thats fine	18
28559	4477	Everyone is entitled to there rights like Katherine Paterson said 'You have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	19
28560	4477	And then we have no books left on the shelf for an of us' So we should all get to read what we enjoy to read, cause reading is endless	20
28561	4478	Books should be removed only if they are found a certain degree of offensive	0
28562	4478	Some other books, though, are meant for educational use and not meant to offend anyone	1
28563	4478	People sometimes take it too seriously	2
28564	4478	Many books have posed a great educational source for many years	3
28565	4478	Books have been around for a very long time	4
28566	4478	People many years ago used to read books on scrolls, or even in pictures to tell stories	5
28567	4478	Stories have been around for a very long time and are meant to be stories, not criticised pieces of work to put down other people	6
28568	4478	There are a lot of books, however, that have been meant to put other people down	7
28569	4478	These books I agree should be taken off the shelves since they might promote people to turn on certain races	8
28570	4478	A good book that demonstrates it is not putting others down but sounds like it might is 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2'	9
28571	4478	This book has been intended for people to read it and learn of the life back when there was slavery or, a time just after slavery but where people did not respect the newly freed men	10
28572	4478	Another book that tells of times during slavery is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1'	11
28573	4478	This book tells of a young boy that runs away to live his old life and meets up with a runaway slave named @PERSON1.This book has been meant to tell of what slaves would be punished by if they were caught	12
28574	4478	Many other books exist as these	13
28575	4478	But I guarentee that over ninety percentile of books are meant to be used for educational purposes due to the context they have been used in	14
28576	4478	Most people will take books the wrong way, but that is only because they are afraid that they will be judged, just as the book was judged by its cover	15
28577	4478	I have read many books over the past couple years, and I find that many of the books that I read have proved to be educational to me	16
28578	4478	There are some books though, that I agree should be taken off the shelves due to them being over the top on offensive	17
28579	4478	Censorship has a job to protect us from many unnerving topics and I agree that certain books should be taken off the shelves	18
28580	4478	But, I think that sometimes, places go over the top with censorship and should let certain people decide which books are right for a place, as well as movies	19
28581	4478	The world is maturing, even as everyone speaks, and people are learning all the time	20
28582	4478	There should be some censorship in public places, but only on over-the-top topics where authors have written about an issue that will offend many people	21
28583	4479	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
28584	4479	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	1
28585	4479	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' wrote by Katherine Paterson	2
28586	4479	If you think about it when you go into a library there is a ton of books to choose from	3
28587	4479	But how many do you think is appropiate for every age and including children, not very many	4
28588	4479	That is why they have sections for the books, but there are times people are rude and mix them up on purpose	5
28589	4479	How many times have you been in a library and find a misplaced book	6
28590	4479	Many of times right, that can be accidental or on purpose	7
28591	4479	I know if I took my child or children to a libraby and they got a book that was inappropiate for them, I would take it to the front desk and complain about that book	8
28592	4479	Now if it was a book that has been misplaced I would take it from them	9
28593	4479	But, yes there are some books, magazines, movies, and music that should be removed from the libray	10
28594	4479	I remember from when I was a little girl going into the library to check out books with my mom or my dad, it did not matter they both enjoyed taking me to the library	11
28595	4479	They were pleased that I loved to read but, one day my mom took me to get books from the library, she did not think about looking at the books I got until we got home and she realized on of my books had a cursing word in it	12
28596	4479	She was not happy at all, I had no clue what she was doing	13
28597	4479	But I figured it out, she grabbed me by my hand and took me to the car	14
28598	4479	She fastened me in and off we went, back to the library	15
28599	4479	She had no problem going off and complaining, I can remember her every word she said it sounded like this	16
28600	4479	'@CAPS1, my name is @LOCATION2 and this is my daughter @PERSON2 she is six years old	17
28601	4479	We were just her about an hour ago, but you want to know the funny reason we are back	18
28602	4479	Well if you can give me a funny reason for why my six year old daughter has a childs book from here with cursing in it	19
28603	4479	Please speak up and explain I would love to hear it.' The lady at the front desk was stunned she has never had someone go off on her for the seven years she had worked there	20
28604	4479	But the book is no longer in the @LOCATION1 library, I can not remember the title of this book, I just know that with a mom like mine she can get something done	21
28605	4479	Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	22
28606	4479	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	23
28607	4479	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I can tell you from experience and observation, you can do and get what ever you want with a little power and persausion	24
28608	4479	It @MONTH1 cause trouble but just set your mind to it and you can help and solve problems when you do set your mind to it	25
28609	4480	When you have children would you want to shield them from something you think is wrong, even though it goes on in the world around you every single day	0
28610	4480	Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship	1
28611	4480	One thing about censorship is that it is just a way the government can control what everyday people say, hear, listen to, read, or even see in today's society	2
28612	4480	We shouldn't be controlled on what we can or can't read, watch, or listen to	3
28613	4480	I have experienced these things almost on a daily basis if it isn't on the radio it's on television	4
28614	4480	When someones words get beeped out for saying something vulgar or innapropriate	5
28615	4480	The second thing about censorship is that no matter what it is, where it is, or even who it is someone will always have a problem with it	6
28616	4480	Just recently in one of my own classes we read an article about a very popular chldren's and young adult's film and a school tried to ban its books from its library because it dealt with sorcery	7
28617	4480	Most of every person I know that has read those books knows that sorcery isn't real	8
28618	4480	Why do people find it necessary to do things like that	9
28619	4480	I think most people just view something that could be entertaining to one person as completely disgusting and disturbing, just because it is a little bit different, I find that as unique not bad	10
28620	4480	The third thing is no matter what public libraries shouldn't be censored	11
28621	4480	Everyone views things differently and they all have different tastes in music, literature, and films	12
28622	4480	Just because someone likes something someone else @MONTH1 find vulgar doesn't mean they should just be able to remove that from the library's public shelves	13
28623	4480	After all the library is public and I put a great deal of stress on it being public because every person in the world today are all different	14
28624	4480	Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship	15
28625	4480	Leaving off on a lighter foot, whether it is purple or green, or old or new, someone will always be able to find something wrong with it	16
28626	4480	I'm sorry to today's society for not being able to realize that most of its problem is trying to control everything that everyone does	17
28627	4481	Libraries have no right in my mind to decide what is offensive and what isn't	0
28628	4481	Libraries shouldn't have the view on censorship the people who rent or buy the items should	1
28629	4481	The @CAPS1 has an idea of what is offensive but they shouldn't be able to make that decision	2
28630	4481	If the @CAPS1 wants buisness they should try to make sure the customers are happy	3
28631	4481	Libraries should take surveys of what everyone wants	4
28632	4481	Not all the people in the world have the same idea of what is a offensive book, magazine, movies, music, etc	5
28633	4481	The different views of people can vary from a lot to none at all	6
28634	4481	If the people feel that they are that offensive then they should bring it up with the @CAPS1 and find a solution instead of getting rid of these items	7
28635	4481	A safe but easy solution would be to create a section just for offensive items the @CAPS1 or people claim them to be	8
28636	4481	Another possible solution would be to jus rearrange the area's of the books into to main category's such as offensive and none offensive, and then break it down into their specific categorys	9
28637	4481	So the libraries need to have a survey showing what items the people think are bad and the librarys opinions and then go on from there	10
28638	4481	The surveys could be made up of a paper one you fill out in the @CAPS1 to it's online website	11
28639	4481	The survey would have a list of books, movies, magazines, and music that people could check off	12
28640	4481	Now the @CAPS1 needs money to keep books and other items in stock and so they can repair them if necessary	13
28641	4481	So if the @CAPS1 feels that a book is offensive they shouldn't have the right to censorship	14
28642	4481	All these books have been in libraries for this amount of time why change it now	15
28643	4481	Think about it if it was offensive why did they put it into the @CAPS1 in the first place	16
28644	4481	So in conclusion the @CAPS1 should have know right to censorship books, movies, magazines, music, or any other item they have	17
28645	4481	This would cost time and money which they don't have	18
28646	4481	Customers could possibly stop comming in because of the change which would be a loss of money	19
28647	4481	Now everyone knows a big loss of money could hurt any buisness and possibley bankrupt them, or could take weeks, months, or even years to recover and no buisness wants that	20
28648	4481	So the easy way to make sure that doesn't happen jus leave everything the way it is	21
28649	4482	Books, music, movies, magazines, ect	0
28650	4482	should be remove if they are offensive to a race or any other kinds of belifs unless they are biogical or historical time line	1
28651	4482	If the reading material is so offensive towards you or your belifs, you @MONTH1 want to see a libarian and tell what you think about so that the reading material will be remove off the sevles and gone	2
28652	4482	I think that if it goes against something in a bad way is should be removed and gone	3
28653	4482	I've read a magazine before and it had some offensive stuff	4
28654	4482	I went to the libarian, told her that i wanted this magazine off the shelves	5
28655	4482	We argued for about five minutes and finally the magazine was off the shelves	6
28656	4482	Nobody wants something to go against them in anyway	7
28657	4482	Thats way we should have offensive material off our libaries shelves.	8
28658	4483	PARENTS @CAPS1                            @CAPS2 @CAPS3                        I believe that certain materials should not be shown	0
28659	4483	But then some books are not offensive too everybody, so it would be unfair if all books were removed from libraries	1
28660	4483	I can relate too @CAPS2 discovering books that's not educational for them	2
28661	4483	It's up too the parents too show their @CAPS2 what too read and what not too read	3
28662	4483	This can also happen with movies, certain movies that @CAPS2 can and can't watch	4
28663	4483	The reason I say this is because if it was up too @CAPS2 on their own too decide what they would want too do, it would usually be negative results	5
28664	4483	Thats what parents are for	6
28665	4483	I was young myself and I had experienced this too at one point	7
28666	4483	The type of movies I watched, I thought they were pretty cool, but I was too young too realize what I was watching and what I was trying too do from a movie	8
28667	4483	I had too learn from my parents that the things I were doing was not rational	9
28668	4483	Then I realize that I was making mistakes	10
28669	4483	It was nothing cool about it	11
28670	4483	friends had told me that as well	12
28671	4483	So i figured out the hard way	13
28672	4483	I don't want any @CAPS2 to experience that	14
28673	4483	Not all parents can stop all @CAPS2 from discovering some disburbing things from books, music, magazines and all	15
28674	4483	What I'm trying too say that it can be reduced	16
28675	4483	Some parents can prevent it from happening	17
28676	4483	somethings can get in sink too a @CAPS2 brain and it could never be helped or solved	18
28677	4483	These things are serious and some people don't take it likely	19
28678	4483	And thats where it takes effect	20
28679	4483	Its up tookids parents or role models to show that some things are'nt meant for them too see until the right time	21
28680	4483	I'm not telling parents to trap their @CAPS2 from the world	22
28681	4483	What I'm saying is that parents should let them know that their going to witness some things	23
28682	4483	They just have to be prepared too see them and hopefully it does'nt take a negative impact on them	24
28683	4483	Hopefully they would be smart enough too tell what's right from wrong	25
28684	4483	Its up too the parents to assist their @CAPS2	26
28685	4483	Its up too the @CAPS2 too know whats good for them	27
28686	4483	I do believe that some @CAPS2 are capable of growing out of some events they learned from movies, too know that they were young, because I grew out of that myself	28
28687	4483	And if I can do it, so can they	29
28688	4483	Its not impossible	30
28689	4483	One good thing is that some @CAPS2 grow up in a positive community to know not read disturbing books/magazines, or watch disturbing movies.	31
28690	4484	Do I think that certain materials that are offensive to other people be removed from the libraries	0
28691	4484	In my opinion I say no to this question	1
28692	4484	I say this because another person in the library might like the certain material that you feel offesive by	2
28693	4484	I don't think certain things that are offensive to one person should be removed	3
28694	4484	It can be an enjoyment to read to the next person	4
28695	4484	In the follow paragraphs I will continue to support more of my answer	5
28696	4484	A library is built for other people enjoyment	6
28697	4484	If a person finds somthing offensive to them I don't think they should get mad because it wasn't put there to hurt you maybe the person that wrote the book went threw the same excat thing you did	7
28698	4484	Most write books, create music, and produce movies to express themselves	8
28699	4484	They put things out there like that because they could encourage someone else	9
28700	4484	Personally I have never found a book, song, or movie to be offensive to me	10
28701	4484	I know that that the person writing the book wasn't tlking to me so I don't see why I have the right to get upset and that goes for everybody else	11
28702	4484	Most people who find things offensive in a library are always looking at the bad side of the situation	12
28703	4484	There is always a good side to every situation	13
28704	4484	Having a good and positive attitude you should see the brighter side of things	14
28705	4484	Most magazines that you read @PERCENT1 of it is talking about celebraties, so that really should'nt have nothing to do with you unless you so in love with that celebraty and just have to say sumthing about it	15
28706	4484	Other than that it's none of your concern	16
28707	4484	Music is a way of expressing ones self in ther own way	17
28708	4484	A person shouldn't feel offended because a song writer wants to express him or herself	18
28709	4484	What if that's the only way they know how to express themselves	19
28710	4484	It's like your saying I don't want them to express themselves because it offends me	20
28711	4484	What if somebody didn't like the way you express yourself and wanted you to stop	21
28712	4484	I'm pretty you wouldn't like that	22
28713	4484	In my conclusion I feel nothin should be removed from the library because it is offensive to someone	23
28714	4484	Certain things are put there for certain people	24
28715	4484	Nobody likes the same thing	25
28716	4484	How I put it, if it offensive somebody oh well I wasnt put ther to offend you on purpose.	26
28717	4485	Have you ever picked up a book, video, or music from the self and wondered why is this here, it's not a well thing for our younger kids to read, watch or listen to	0
28718	4485	I think that we should pluck out these types of books on our shelf at our libaray to better our community for our kids and their kids	1
28719	4485	We have all the right to voice our opion on things that we think should and shouldn't be in our libaray	2
28720	4485	Books that promote sexual activity, killing people, using or taking drugs, and other harmful things, which isn't the best for our kids to read, listen to, or watch should be removed from our libaray shelf	3
28721	4485	Have you ever noticed how are crime rate and drug rate has went up in the past few years	4
28722	4485	These types promotes are in some of our books, videos, and other media	5
28723	4485	If we remove the videos, books, and other media that promote this kindof behavior we would have less of this type of crimes going on	6
28724	4485	I don't believe we would have all this crimes going on if we would remove this type of media because we all have a person we want to be like in a song or tv show or even in a book so we follow what they do, if they promote crime you try to act like them	7
28725	4485	We as humans follow the actions of others weither we think about it or not	8
28726	4485	Music also plays a big roll in this to, music containing bad laguage or promoting someone to take drugs or kill people, has been proven to play with our minds	9
28727	4485	Would you as a parent want to see your kid raised up in a community that promotes sex, drugs, kill people, and other things that we shouldn't do	10
28728	4485	There's music we all like out there, we listen to what we like so that being, if we like rap for explain, if it promotes killing we are more likely to follow that action in the song because your mind thinks it's self out of it being a crime to kill cause you like rap music so it must be okay	11
28729	4485	We @CAPS1's in our community believe that we should abstian our selfs from this kindof behavior and we don't see to many drugs, killings, or sexual activity	12
28730	4485	The bilbe teaches us to stay away from things that promote drugs, killing, or sexual activiy, thus we don't see much of these behavoirs in a @CAPS2 home or community	13
28731	4485	@CAPS4 are more better off then lot's of us weither we want to aceppt that or not	14
28732	4485	They live a life after @CAPS3, which don't promote all these behavoirs	15
28733	4485	and I know that @CAPS4 would be more willing to take out these type of media in our libaray	16
28734	4485	You can sit for one whole day and watch the actions of @CAPS4 and how they act they don't act like normal people as far as into drugs and stuff like that, only because they abstain their selfs from media that promotes sex, killing, and drugs	17
28735	4485	Now, if you want to help us make our community a better place for your kids and their kids, let's remove the harmful media in our libaray that promotes sex, drugs, and killing	18
28736	4485	I don't think you would want to see your kid doing drugs or killing people and messing up their lifes because you didn't help in removing this media	19
28737	4485	Please help us better our community for our kids and their kids and the genrations to come after us.	20
28738	4486	Should materials that some people find offensive be removed from libraries	0
28739	4486	No I do not think that any materials should be removed from libraries	1
28740	4486	A librarie should have lots of different kinds of books, magazines, music, and movies	2
28741	4486	One reason I think that a librarie should have all sorts of different books is because everybody doesn't like to read the same thing	3
28742	4486	Like for example some kids could love to read scary and gory books and others could like to read books about sports or love stories	4
28743	4486	So maybe the kids that read sport books could be offended by all the gory books, but that wouldn't be fair to take them out of the librarie because some kids like to read gory books	5
28744	4486	Another reason they shouldn't remove any magazines, books, etc, is because it is nice to get to read or look at different things	6
28745	4486	People would get bored if their librarie only had books about war	7
28746	4486	Kids need to learn how to read different kinds of stories	8
28747	4486	Also if your librarie has all different kinds of magazines kids could learn a lot of interesting facts	9
28748	4486	You can find a lot of amazing things in a magazine	10
28749	4486	So if you only had four magazines about the same thing kids wouldn't discover anymore cool facts	11
28750	4486	A librarie is a place where kids like to go and enjoy some peace and quiet and look and read different things	12
28751	4486	So I think if you started taking specific things out of the librarie then I think kids would stop coming to the librarie	13
28752	4486	A librarie contains awsome infromation that kids could learn, but if you start taking things out then not that many kids will come to the librarie because they will not be learning @CAPS1 new	14
28753	4486	So if I had any say in this I would keep all things in the librarie	15
28754	4486	I would not remove @CAPS1	16
28755	4486	You want people to come to your librarie so you dont want to do @CAPS1 that can jeperdize people coming to your librarie	17
28756	4486	I think if you start removing things then your going to have less and less people come in and eventually maybe your librarie will get shut down because you have no buisness	18
28757	4486	So leave everything on the shelves.	19
28758	4487	There a lot of things to life and sometimes we do need as much help as we can get	0
28759	4487	Sometimes people will do anything to get help or go anywhere to find it	1
28760	4487	Because when people feel lost it's the most scraest thing to a person	2
28761	4487	So they turn to reading books, listening to music, watching movies, also looking and reading magazins	3
28762	4487	But although thats not the best way you can go there times when you need to listen to your soul the most	4
28763	4487	Now there was a time when know one knew how to read or even was a loud to read	5
28764	4487	But now adays reading as taking over	6
28765	4487	If you can read you can do anything , you could be the one to run to whole world one day if you read things right	7
28766	4487	Books and magazins there are is not a big different between the two	8
28767	4487	Books can take you mind off some where that you  have never seen before and places like the wild, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1's, and high up and trees	9
28768	4487	It teaches you @LOCATION1 thing  but not every thing it teaches is good	10
28769	4487	Books can lie about whats about to happen to the world	11
28770	4487	Now magazing show you what all the starts are doing and how there living and what there house looks like and there money their begin home	12
28771	4487	There one thing you have to understand you can't always get scraed and thing what you reading is right you have to read your mind it see what it says about what you just read	13
28772	4487	When you hear your favtor song what do you or when you see your favtor movie	14
28773	4487	Do start dancing or do you cry when they break up, do you say I can sing like her or do you rein act the part in the movie	15
28774	4487	These things can help you or make you think about things you shouldn't do to people or even to yourself	16
28775	4487	Music can make you think about what your life has been throw or miss the person that  has died because they listen to that one song so much	17
28776	4487	Music can talk you in to killing yourself drive you crazy, hurt your soul when hear what someone else has been throw	18
28777	4487	Its all about how you take the song when you first hear it and take the messages out of it	19
28778	4487	Movies show history and show you want happens to people when they do the wrong things what will happen to them	20
28779	4487	There could be a ican in the movie your watching and could want to be like him/her	21
28780	4487	But not everyone you see you shouldn't want to be like them	22
28781	4487	You have to be yourself at the end of the day	23
28782	4487	Because you wake up looking at you everyday and love you everyday and take care of you everyday	24
28783	4487	When it's all said and done you have to belive in yourself and  not listen to what everyone is trying you	25
28784	4487	Go with you soul	26
28785	4487	Yes listening to it or read or even watching ir but just remember flow your deams and do what you love	27
28786	4487	So thants what I thing about music,books,movie and magazing listen but don't listen at the same tim	28
28787	4488	I think that movies, and magazines should be censured to kids at the library	0
28788	4488	There are many reasons these things should be censured and in this paper I am going to explain why they should be censured	1
28789	4488	I am also going to give a few examples of some stuff that shouldn't be possible for kids to get	2
28790	4488	The main reason movies should be censured is because movies that are rated @CAPS1 are not only supposed to be rented by children but it wrong to rent these movies to them	3
28791	4488	I mean if there is a sex scene or something and your only like eight years old this would be awkward for the parents to explain what the actors are doing	4
28792	4488	I mean if you were a parent would you want to explain to your eight year what sex is	5
28793	4488	The next thing that I think should be censured at the library is magazines	6
28794	4488	I know three in perticular off the top of my head, and they are @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @ORGANIZATION1	7
28795	4488	These three magazines talk about how to be better in bed	8
28796	4488	I really don't any kid, teenagers included should need to know how to be better in bed	9
28797	4488	They also have several unhealthy diets that teenagers might try	10
28798	4488	This could cause them to get very sick and if they're already skinny, they could possibly die	11
28799	4488	Well this pretty much sums up what I think about library contents being censured	12
28800	4488	I don't really think there are many books that are that bad for kids ears and eyes	13
28801	4488	I mean there are romances but I don't think any kid is going to last thru a whole romance, because they are pretty boring	14
28802	4488	Well I hope this will prevent libraries from letting kids get ahold of this kind of content	15
28803	4489	In libraries there are some books,music,magaizines that are not very apporiate to put on shelves	0
28804	4489	There are little kids that will want to look at anything they can get their hands on	1
28805	4489	They are very mysterious when it comes to that	2
28806	4489	There are bad books but there are also good books in the library	3
28807	4489	If people found a book or any type of material in the library and found it offensive, then they should take it off the shelf	4
28808	4489	There are children that look at anything they want or what they think looks interesting	5
28809	4489	The library also should at least check what the book is about when it arrives at the library	6
28810	4489	That way no one would have to worry about a material being offensive	7
28811	4489	Movies should not matter really because there are a lot of bad movies but i dont think that people would find them offensive	8
28812	4489	They dont have to watch it and neither do their children	9
28813	4489	There is a lot of bad music	10
28814	4489	I think there should be censorship on music because some music today is about drugs,alchoal, and violance	11
28815	4489	People would not want to see that in their local library for their children to see	12
28816	4489	I have seen on the news people get upset when they see something that they think is inappropiate for underage children	13
28817	4489	I would get mad too because i dont want an underage child to be listening to that type of music	14
28818	4489	Children now look up to these song writers and want to become them	15
28819	4489	That is not a good thing at all	16
28820	4489	All magazines can be offensive to people just by looking at the cover and who the cover person is	17
28821	4489	Libraries would not put a inappropiate magazine on the shelves	18
28822	4489	There are some magazines that they have but they are good magazines even for children to read	19
28823	4489	I think that the libraries dont put offensive magazines out because they dont want any controversy	20
28824	4489	People today have came out even more good magazines for anyone to read that is not inappropaite for anyone	21
28825	4489	I think some people today dont realize that the library would want to offend anyone by putting those offensive magaizines,movies,books and music	22
28826	4489	Putting censorship on those things would be a good thing because there are materials that are not good for small children to read or hear or watch	23
28827	4489	The parents dont want their children looking up to a person who is involved in violence or drugs or alchoal	24
28828	4489	Censorship would be they way to go on all those materials just to keep away contoversy and the children safe.	25
28829	4490	Censorship can be considered as a major problem	0
28830	4490	I believe it is our right to read and publish what we want	1
28831	4490	It should not be another person's opinion effecting what we can and cannot read, listen to, or even watch	2
28832	4490	Lastly, censorship is a popular communist trend	3
28833	4490	Therefore, I believe censorship is wrong	4
28834	4490	First of all, we have a right to say, read, write, and watch what we want, as long as it is not slandering someone	5
28835	4490	I don't believe that issue of slander is what is causing the censorship of many books today	6
28836	4490	So, in any other case censorship would be wrong and immoral	7
28837	4490	Second, it shouldn't be someone elses opinion that effects whether anything is censored	8
28838	4490	My opinion @MONTH1 differ from another person's and their opinion @MONTH1 be way different from someone elses	9
28839	4490	If they think it should be censored, they shouldn't read it themselves	10
28840	4490	Others @MONTH1 find the book, movie, or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting	11
28841	4490	Lastly, censorship is a communist trend	12
28842	4490	Last I checked, the @LOCATION1 is a democracy	13
28843	4490	So, it would be going back on our fundamentals of government to censor anything that isn't detrimental or slander to a person or race	14
28844	4490	So, censorship shouldn't be allowed anywhere	15
28845	4490	It is a very communist thing to do	16
28846	4490	It infringes our rights	17
28847	4490	Lastly, opinions are varied among people what should and should not be censored making it impossible to know what really should and shouldn't be censored	18
28848	4491	Throughout history their have always been those who have refuted the beliefs and ideals of others	0
28849	4491	Whether that be in @LOCATION1 when statues were censored by removing anything deemed offensive by the @CAPS1 church or the mass burning of books to preserve ideals that could invalidated through the clear spoken text	1
28850	4491	However this in not the @DATE1, women are not looked down upon anymore, science is not dillouted, and ideas are free throughout the world with the internet	2
28851	4491	So is it the libraries fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents fault, for not educating their children on the morality of such items	3
28852	4491	The modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses	4
28853	4491	Movies over @CAPS2 attract both parents and teenagers alike, the music entices the teenagers, and the books and prior two media sources attract younger children	5
28854	4491	So how would it be fair to force a library to censor two of the things that earn the library the most money just so that kids don't read,watch or hear them	6
28855	4491	Plus libraries generally don't let young kids check out @CAPS3 rated movies or parental advisory @CAPS4	7
28856	4491	Some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults	8
28857	4491	As books can raise ideas and strengthen them in a teens mind over the course of @NUM1 pages till parents end up with an anti-sematic teen with bad view on racism	9
28858	4491	So then why would that be the fault of the library as it merely provided one book that should not have affected that teen so much, had that teen had solid moral beliefs instilled in him or her from their parents	10
28859	4491	So if you find materials at a library offensive, or worry about your child going there, there's always an easy solution	11
28860	4491	Don't go their and don't let your child go their	12
28861	4491	However if you see the beauty in impurity that a library brings to a community and to a person as I do then don't allow the injustice to authors, songwriters, musicians, directors, and yourself occur.	13
28862	4492	Every we go there is censorship	0
28863	4492	Childrean hear their parents saying them and are more than likely to repeat them	1
28864	4492	Children should know what cursing is and know it is not right to do	2
28865	4492	It should be up to the children what they read	3
28866	4492	Books should be censored if they are made for children	4
28867	4492	Adults should have the option of reading any type of book they would like	5
28868	4492	Children who have been secluded should learn that curse words are a part of reality also	6
28869	4492	We can learn something from any thing we read	7
28870	4492	There are a lot of facts teachers do not teach that books can	8
28871	4492	When uncensensored things are said aloud children are estatic	9
28872	4492	If they read themselves they would learn alot more	10
28873	4492	If your parents do not inform you either, you can miss out on some of the most important facts of life	11
28874	4492	It is very unnecessary to have rated @CAPS1 movies.Parents should be able to watch a mature movie with their children without being on the watch for something they do not want their child to see	12
28875	4492	The choice of children watching censory movies should definitely be on the parent	13
28876	4492	I always think it is a bad idea to have derrogatory pictures on magazines	14
28877	4492	These photos @MONTH1 give children negative thought, such as insecurity of wishing they looked better than the model	15
28878	4492	Children remember almost everthing they hear/see	16
28879	4492	It should be up to the children what they read.	17
28880	4493	'@CAPS1 day @CAPS4 @CAPS3, my dad was pulled over three times for @CAPS2: @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5.' @CAPS6 is just @CAPS1 of several quotes from a book that I am reading that some people could take offense to	0
28881	4493	The book in general is a rather appeasing book, it's just some things, people might take offense to	1
28882	4493	That doesn't mean the book shouldn't belong on shelves	2
28883	4493	I don't think that libraries should be forced to take books off shelves just because they offended someone	3
28884	4493	That's like saying you should shoot everyone who has made an offensive comment to somebody in their life, you would be left with nothing in the end	4
28885	4493	If someone finds the things that other people have to say, offensive, they generally stop hanging out with that person	5
28886	4493	Therefore, it would only make sense for someone to stop reading a book if they find it offensive	6
28887	4493	Some magazines have really offensive things in them, that people in the real world say	7
28888	4493	It's not like your generic non-fiction books that come up with insulting things to say, at a high school level	8
28889	4493	You don't have to subscirbe to that particular magazine, or even pick it up to read	9
28890	4493	These days, so many things offend so many people, in so many different ways	10
28891	4493	What might offend @PERSON1 down the street, @PERSON2 across town might find funny.You cannot make everyone happy, and if you took books off the shlef because someone complained about the offensive things that they read, you would be trying to appease to everyones' wants and needs	11
28892	4493	I think it would be fair to put a restriction on books, about age limits	12
28893	4493	Some of the more offensive ones could have the higher age limits	13
28894	4493	At the junior high I attended, they have books categorized as 'young adult' books, which means you either have to be in eighth grade or have a note from your guardian saying that it's alright for you to read those types of books	14
28895	4493	It'd be just like movies	15
28896	4493	movies have the ratings so that only certain people can watch them, why can't they do the same with books	16
28897	4493	I guess what I am trying to say is that it would be very disappointing to me and numerous other people if you just started taking books, @CAPS7, movies, magazines, and so on, off the shelves, and out of market just because someone cried foul against it	17
28898	4493	If they don't like the material that they are looking at, reading, watching, listening to, or all the above, no @CAPS1 is forcing them to pay attention to it	18
28899	4493	They can go read the nursery rhymes, because those are not offenesive	19
28900	4493	Once again I say, taking a book off the shelf everytime someone complains about the material would be like shooting every person who has ever made an offensive comment to someone in their lifetime, you'd be left with nothing.	20
28901	4494	Taking books off the shelves	0
28902	4494	I don't think so	1
28903	4494	When you go to the library, what kind of books do you look for	2
28904	4494	I like mysteries and scary books, they keep me on the edge of my seat, however	3
28905	4494	some that I have read @MONTH1 not be appropriate for children younger than me	4
28906	4494	People are saying they want to remove books, music, and movies from the library when they are found offensive, but I think that is a bad idea	5
28907	4494	People don't always read books or watch movies because it is their choice	6
28908	4494	You can find a lot of younger kids at the library theses days for school purposes	7
28909	4494	From my own experience, I had to get a movie at the library once for a project	8
28910	4494	It was about the civil war	9
28911	4494	The movie had some disturbing scenes in it, but I had to watch it for school	10
28912	4494	If it had not been at the library, what would I have done	11
28913	4494	That is one reason why I do not think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea	12
28914	4494	As I said at the beginning, I like mystery books	13
28915	4494	Some mystery books have parts in them that @MONTH1 be offensive	14
28916	4494	The book I am reading now is about a murder of a young girl	15
28917	4494	I think this would be an offensive book for someone young, or for someone who's loved one was murdered, but that does not mean I think they should remove it from the library	16
28918	4494	If they took books like that away, what would the people that like them do	17
28919	4494	It does not seem fair to me	18
28920	4494	For people who find books, movies, music, or magazines at the library offensive, simply do not use them	19
28921	4494	The library is a place where you can find almost anything you are interrested in	20
28922	4494	So lets keep everyone in mind, and their different interrests	21
28923	4494	It is also a place where you can find a lot of information even though it could be offensive	22
28924	4494	It would not be fair or right to remove books from the library	23
28925	4495	In my opinion, censorship of any kind shouldn't exist, especially in libraries	0
28926	4495	Libraries are where anyone can go and check out a book, @CAPS1, magazine, or movie	1
28927	4495	It's where the poor can have access to the same materials the better off have	2
28928	4495	If you take away opinions in books, music, film or magazine/newspaper articles, then you're taking away the author's right to freedom of speech just because someone deemed it offensive	3
28929	4495	The right to free speech is an important one in the @LOCATION1, we can have opinions here, we can choose our beliefs, and if someone wants to share their beliefs and opinions by form of writing, then they should be allowed	4
28930	4495	Writing is a form of expression, writers can express their thoughts, use their imagination to come up with fantasy worlds and unique characters	5
28931	4495	Who does one think they are to say it's offensive	6
28932	4495	Who gets to decide that this book of movie is offensive	7
28933	4495	If we take away books that one person finds 'offensive', we wouldn't have anything to read	8
28934	4495	Some people @MONTH1 find the @CAPS2 offensive, but we still put that in libraries, some people @MONTH1 find books on wizardry and vampires offensive, yet those are all rage now, we wouldn't take those away	9
28935	4495	Things that people find offensive are just opinions--just like the ones of those of the writers	10
28936	4495	It just simply wouldn't work out--if you want young people to read, you have to give them something to read that will stimulate their interests, and sometimes that @MONTH1 be 'offensive.	11
28937	4496	There are many different kinds of books in the library	0
28938	4496	Not all of them are for the eyes of every person out there	1
28939	4496	I think that libraries should censor the books, movies, and magazines so that either they are in a certain room where only adults can see or get them, or they are not in the library at all	2
28940	4496	The books in the libraries can have some very obseen items in them that young children should not be able to see	3
28941	4496	I have been to the library many times, whether it be by myself or with others	4
28942	4496	I know what is out there and some of the books or movies are not always kid rated	5
28943	4496	I would like to someday beable to take my own child into the library knowing that what they are going to see is okay for their eyes	6
28944	4496	Magazines are always talking about new relationships or this person is having a baby or anything along those lines, and I don't want my child seeing that	7
28945	4496	The library I usually go to has the magazines out where everyone can view them and I don't want this for my son or daughter who is of a young age	8
28946	4496	I think a parent should be able to take their children into a library knowing that when their child runs up to them with a book, it will be something that they are aloud to read or get and not something that an adult would read	9
28947	4496	Libraries could always make a seperate room for books and movies that are not always for children	10
28948	4496	Such as the rated @CAPS1 movies or books that are inappropriate for young children	11
28949	4496	That way when a little kid is running around looking for a new book to read, they can't see or pick up these books or movies	12
28950	4496	I don't know about the other adults or parents out there, but I sure don't want my little kid walking around talking about an inappropriate book or movie they saw at the library	13
28951	4496	Since libraries have many different kinds of magazines, books, and movies, it is not always a safe place to just let your child roam around	14
28952	4496	Libraries could always make a seperate room for items like this	15
28953	4496	For the books that are for older @ORGANIZATION1, movies that are rated @CAPS1, or magazines such as @ORGANIZATION1	16
28954	4496	I think that if libraries did this, parents would be much more at ease to taking their children and letting them run around and look for new and interesting books to read or movies to watch	17
28955	4497	There are many reasons why censorship can be thought of as a good thing, or a bad thing	0
28956	4497	I am against censorship	1
28957	4497	My reasons are that just because someting is there that you don't like, doesn't mean that you have to look at it or use it	2
28958	4497	There are plenty of people that would like to have access to that information or entertainment	3
28959	4497	Another reason is, that if there's something that someone doesn't  want their child looking at, then they should either trust that their child won't look at it, or prevent them from seeing it	4
28960	4497	Finally, what would be left if everyone were to remove somthing that they took offense to	5
28961	4497	Nothing would be left to read, listen to or watch	6
28962	4497	First, why I think censorship is wrong, is that the people that take offense to what they want removed, don't have to look at whats offensive	7
28963	4497	No one is forcing them to look at it or use it	8
28964	4497	They're better off just ignoring it	9
28965	4497	Because other people, that don't take offense to it, have the right to look at or use it	10
28966	4497	The library might be the only place that someone could have access to that sort of material	11
28967	4497	So if someone were to remove that material, the person that needs or wants it, would not have the access to use it	12
28968	4497	And they are given the right to use it	13
28969	4497	Their child might even have the right to it	14
28970	4497	Second is that some people wouldn't want their child seeing those things	15
28971	4497	But removing it shouldn't be that persons first instinct	16
28972	4497	I believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at it	17
28973	4497	And if they can't, then they need to somehow prevent their child from viewing it	18
28974	4497	not by removing it	19
28975	4497	The parent should be able to come up with a reasonable way of preventing their child from viewing things that they don't want the child viewing, rather than taking that thing away from the child, and the whole community	20
28976	4497	Lastly, let's say that in a library, theres at least one book to each person in a community that offends that person	21
28977	4497	If they were each given the right to remove the book that offended them, what would be left to read	22
28978	4497	Absolutely nothing	23
28979	4497	And each of those people that removed a book, most likely would enjoy another book that someone thought was offensive	24
28980	4497	So now there isn't a single book for that person to read, just because everyone else disliked the books they didn't think were offensive	25
28981	4497	Once someone starts removing, other people will join in, and you'd be left with an empty library	26
28982	4497	Thats what I think about cencorship	27
28983	4497	It's really just wrong	28
28984	4497	Personally, I would like to be able to go to my library and pick out a good book	29
28985	4497	And I know other people like to do that too	30
28986	4497	So why should anyone else be able to take that away from them	31
28987	4498	Have you ever read or listened to somthing that is so disturbing that you wonder how it even got the right to be published	0
28988	4498	Well, music, books, and magazines these days are full of garbage and innapropriete thoughts that children listen to and base there life off of	1
28989	4498	All of these resources that kids can find that has this kinda of material in it can be found in libraries	2
28990	4498	We have to put an end to it or find some source of censorship for these library resources	3
28991	4498	A library has the tendency to be known as boring or a very plain place	4
28992	4498	If a kid in school comes through the hallway saying he found a really good book, other kids become interested in it	5
28993	4498	they find out it has drugs in it and they assume that this is not a boring book like all the others that you would find in a library	6
28994	4498	Then, more and more people get that book and other books that have this style of materials are being discovered and checked out	7
28995	4498	Now, all these children with these popular books consider themselves 'cool'	8
28996	4498	So, these children start making actions and start behaving the same way the characters are in the book	9
28997	4498	This leads to disaster	10
28998	4498	Music can be the same way	11
28999	4498	Music that has been recorded in the past ten years pick up sexual references, drug usage, and innopropriete behavior in its lyrics	12
29000	4498	Why would anyone want to put this kind of material in there masterpiece	13
29001	4498	Well singers and writers have found out that pieces containing these topics have sold the most copies	14
29002	4498	So, every artist of any kind of work is puting these references in there books or songs	15
29003	4498	Now, singers are starting to make music videos which not along sings these lyrics but shows them as well	16
29004	4498	Children see these artist in these videos with attactive mates, lots of money, and living the 'perfect life'	17
29005	4498	So, this person try doing the same thing this artist did to make there life more like theres	18
29006	4498	Movies come along then, movies have seen the ratings go up on these kind of styles, so they start puting them in there film	19
29007	4498	Now, all these pieces have this garbage in it and has had it in it for quite some time	20
29008	4498	How do we get it out	21
29009	4498	How do we get our children to stop getting these resources	22
29010	4498	No parents want to walk around and hear there children saying these things or doing these actions	23
29011	4498	So libraries have to have some censorship on there work	24
29012	4498	there work should be removed so minors wont get the wrong message	25
29013	4498	What ever happened to the good old days when music, movies, and art was a special talent and was not looked up to as somthing that would get our children into some trouble	26
29014	4498	We need to get these censorships in libraries and get back to the good old days before things get more out of hand than they already are	27
29015	4499	I was asked the question 'Do you believe that a certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazine, etc.	0
29016	4499	should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensice?' I would have to say no	1
29017	4499	I dont think you should be in the library to be critisizing what other people believe in	2
29018	4499	But what if you just come past a book, movie, music, or magizine that is offensive	3
29019	4499	Just ignore it	4
29020	4499	I dont think people have enough time to be caring what other people think, even though people do it all the time	5
29021	4499	Next time you see a book that is offensive to you just walk away from it and dont bother looking at it	6
29022	4499	Everything can be offensive to anyone, @PERSON2 was completly right when she had said '...If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...The you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	7
29023	4499	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think this day and age everykid knows more than they're supposed to anyways, so why cencor what they already know	8
29024	4499	What if you might like this specific series and it is about the haulacaust and it is like many different story made into one to tell about how the @CAPS1 stayed in the camps, but your not @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, and a @CAPS2 happens to read it and get it taken off the shelfs cause it's offensive	9
29025	4499	Maybe he thought it was a disgrace and lies about his home country and it's making people think they're all like the @CAPS5.If theat had happened to you what would you do	10
29026	4499	Would you go looking for a new book	11
29027	4499	Or would you be upset cause you weren't able to finish the whole series	12
29028	4499	Many people things offensive every single day, when they shouldn't	13
29029	4499	People try to act like they're better than everyone else, and it's not right	14
29030	4499	If your one to take things in books, movies, music, or magazines offensive then you need to get over yourself and realize that you need to spend more time on living life rather than get upset cause of stupid pitty stuff	15
29031	4499	In music they're are certain words used that one might like to be called, but if a differnt race decided to sing about it too then he might get upset and think that he's being rasict	16
29032	4499	It's not being rasict, offenending, or directed towards you	17
29033	4499	So, just do everyone a favor and stop complaining	18
29034	4499	Now Katherine Paterson, @CAPS6 if you have a problem with your child or any other children taking a book off a shelf even though it might offend some I think you need to realize that it is a good thing that, that child is still trying to read, and trying to get better at reading by reading	19
29035	4499	There are selected magazines and movies out there on shelfs of publi libraries and stores that might be offending others, but if it is offending you why are you looking or even gonna buy/check it out	20
29036	4499	I personally dont think any books should be taken off the shelf of any library anywhere	21
29037	4499	taking books off shelves are like telling people to stop reading	22
29038	4501	When someone goes to the library, there is multiple items to choose from	0
29039	4501	There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc	1
29040	4501	But not all of this is nessessarilly a good thing	2
29041	4501	There are several books, movies, and music albums that can be either offensive or not right for a library's audience	3
29042	4501	The material that is offensive should not be on the shelves for children sake	4
29043	4501	Although there is much good items in a library, there is also bad or offensive items in a library as well	5
29044	4501	For example, an explicit music album	6
29045	4501	If an explicit music album is just sitting on the shelf of a library, then any person could listen to it or take it out for awhile	7
29046	4501	By taking out the bad music, that keeps younger kids away from the explicit music that most parents don't want there children listening to anyway	8
29047	4501	Movies are also a problem in library's	9
29048	4501	For example, library's having @CAPS1 rated movies on the shelves for anyone to take out to go watch	10
29049	4501	Most @CAPS1 rated movies have something in them that doesn't make them child appropriate	11
29050	4501	Movies that are @CAPS1 rated are rated that because of all the material in the movie	12
29051	4501	This is why when these movies are played on television, they are edited so all audiences can watch	13
29052	4501	So by taking these types of movies off the shelves in library's, it keeps young children away from inappropriate behavior	14
29053	4501	Books are the same way as movies and music	15
29054	4501	There are books on the shelves that some people concider 'funny', but in all reality, it's a harmful book	16
29055	4501	There are books made that include racial material in them, even deragator statements	17
29056	4501	By taking these types of books off the shelves of library's, a lot more people wouldn't be introduced to all the racial comments that occur	18
29057	4501	For the sake of the children and young kids, any material that is found offensive in library's should be removed	19
29058	4501	If library's would just remove all the bad materials, it'll make all library's a more healthy and stable enviornment for studying like it used to be used for	20
29059	4501	Take out all the offensvie material, then they could put more educational books, movies, etc.	21
29060	4502	What is offensive in libraries	0
29061	4502	The offenses in libraries are inappropriate and non-censored books, music, magazines, movies, and other materials in libraries	1
29062	4502	These books and other things in these libraries should not be removed from the shelves	2
29063	4502	They should not be removed because the authors of the books are just writting	3
29064	4502	From my own experience, I have seen innapropriate movies	4
29065	4502	To me, I feel that they teach me some lessons, but, it also depends on what type of movie it is	5
29066	4502	If it is rated @CAPS1 then I know that I @MONTH1 see some blood, gory scenes, and nudity	6
29067	4502	If this type of movie is not @CAPS2 @CAPS3, then I know that some of this stuff on the screen @MONTH1 happen in real life	7
29068	4502	Most @MONTH1 not happen, but there is a good chance that some of it will happen to someone in the world	8
29069	4502	All of this teaches me to be more careful about what I am doing and where I am doing it at	9
29070	4502	In libraries, there should not be nudity websites, books, or magazines or anything like that because that is just stupid and innapropriate for any child to see, especially in a public library	10
29071	4502	Now if a gory or a book with lots of blood in it, then it should stay on the shelves	11
29072	4502	I say it honestly shows and maybe teaches others not to do the same thing	12
29073	4502	So, as I ask again, what @MONTH1 be offensive in libraries	13
29074	4502	Some @MONTH1 say that books, magazines, movies etc	14
29075	4502	with racial slurs are offensive	15
29076	4502	but to others, it just shows how cruel and horrible the world can be	16
29077	4502	In my perspective, I just feel that the authors of these books are just writing and lets the creativeness take over	17
29078	4502	That @MONTH1 be it, it @MONTH1 not	18
29079	4502	In so many words, I say that the 'offensive' books, magazines, music, movies and other materials should stay on the shelf	19
29080	4502	For so many reasons I have said, and the ones I have not said, they help people learn.	20
29081	4503	Should libraries be more careful about what they put out in their place of establishment	0
29082	4503	Of course they should	1
29083	4503	Libraries have all kinds of people walking in and out everyday	2
29084	4503	Certain rated material should be put in certain spots for certain people	3
29085	4503	The library should be more strict on the material that the people in the library look at on a day to day basis	4
29086	4503	Libraries need to become a little more organized	5
29087	4503	Libraries have people that come in and out of the library everyday	6
29088	4503	People of all different ages and anyone is welcome to come in the library	7
29089	4503	With that being said, children of all ages come into the library all the time and pick all kinds of material	8
29090	4503	Children of course can't read everything in the library	9
29091	4503	They have to stay within their appropriate rated material selection	10
29092	4503	So if the library is more censored and strict about the material children can't get their hands on the material that they shouldn't be seeing at that time in their lives	11
29093	4503	You would want your seven year old child seeing inappropriate or offensive material, right	12
29094	4503	Libraries should put the material that for adults eyes only in one completely different section of the library than what they would want the children that come to the library to see	13
29095	4503	With doing that it decreases the chances of the children getting a hold of material that they should see	14
29096	4503	Also, some books that the library think that some children should be able to see just might be offinsive to another set of people and wouldn't want their children to see	15
29097	4503	So books @MONTH1 show racism, or maybe another kind of discrimination and it @MONTH1 not be the goal of the book to make that suggestion but it still is in the book and in the wrong hands it can be a very bad thing especially in some childrens minds	16
29098	4503	The libraries really need to just stop and think for a second is this book really appropriate for this age group or even for this establishment	17
29099	4503	Libraries have become where children are just checking out books by themselves and to me thats a problem	18
29100	4503	I think that children need a parents concent to check out a book from a library but do the libraries care, no	19
29101	4503	Library @MONTH1 check their inventory and notice a book @MONTH1 be missing but guess what, by that time its already to late	20
29102	4503	Children are able to just walk right out with books these days and know one will even think that they just took a book without checking it out	21
29103	4503	When children find a piece of material in a library and they know they aren't suppose to have it and they know they cant get out of the library with it they might decide to just take the book	22
29104	4503	The sercurity wont think twice to check the child and what is the result the childs mind is corrupted	23
29105	4503	Guess what you can blame it on the though the library	24
29106	4503	Isen't that something the child got the material from your friendly neighborhood library	25
29107	4503	Oranization is the key	26
29108	4503	Libraries need to orginize their material better, plane and simple	27
29109	4503	It's really not that hard	28
29110	4503	They need to review the content that thier putting on the shelves in their establishment	29
29111	4503	I feel that the people at the library are lazy personally	30
29112	4503	If they just gave a little more effort maybe the children wouldn't get their hand on material that they have no buisness getting a hold of	31
29113	4503	Just pay attention to whats going on in the library	32
29114	4503	Their are books everywhere, right	33
29115	4503	Their are children, correct	34
29116	4503	The children @MONTH1 be in their appropriate rated section of the library but maybe a book from the adult section of the library stumbled over there by accident	35
29117	4503	Though it was an accident it still happened and it can be prevented and it should be prevented for the sake of the children	36
29118	4503	All we need is a little more organization	37
29119	4503	As you can see from the following libraries just don't about our children as much as we do	38
29120	4503	It's okay that everyone is welcome in the library no questions asked but, they people need to stay in the designated place in the library	39
29121	4503	Children shouldn't be allowed in the adult section for saftey	40
29122	4503	Also a book from the adult side shouldn't be in the childrens section because anything can happen and corruption will rise	41
29123	4503	We need stricter libraries	42
29124	4503	Better sercurity to what they children are looking at and where the material is	43
29125	4503	Also the library really needs to look at the material and decide if it is appropriate for all the readers that @MONTH1 look at the material	44
29126	4503	Organization is the key to all our worries, if we use a bit more effort this won't be a problem anymore.	45
29127	4504	Pornography, vulgar language, grotesque scenes and many other things make books and movies inappropriate for some	0
29128	4504	In a culture like the one we have @DATE1, censorship usually takes the back seat	1
29129	4504	The media constantly portrays sensual elements and the language is also bad	2
29130	4504	People have always had a right to view what they want and read what they want due to the freedom that this very country provides	3
29131	4504	Every person is titled with their own opinion but there should not be censorship in libraries	4
29132	4504	There are many things in libraries @DATE1 that portray bad images and contain questionable content	5
29133	4504	Books and movies have things in them that indeed children shouldn't view, but the library is not able to take them down	6
29134	4504	People enjoy seeing and hearing these things, that's why @CAPS1 comes out with more rated @CAPS2 movies than all the other ratings combined	7
29135	4504	They make the most money off of them	8
29136	4504	In @DATE1's economy, the library needs to keep these things on their shelf so that they can stay in business	9
29137	4504	If people are offended by it, then stay away from that area and don't pick up the book or movie	10
29138	4504	If someone were to decide to take down a book or movie that they view as offensive then they are breaking the freedom that this has	11
29139	4504	Censorship is an opinion based topic that one cannot make on their own	12
29140	4504	As one can see, the censorship of books and movies is not entitled to a personal opinion	13
29141	4504	It is the duty of the library to keep the freedoms of the people and provide them with the entertainment that they want	14
29142	4504	Books and movies with adult content in them can also provide insight on what a society should not be like	15
29143	4504	Parents should modify what their children watch, but as an adult they are able to watch or read anything that they want to	16
29144	4505	Hey my name is @PERSON1 and I have some things to talk about that people need to hear	0
29145	4505	I think that libraries are a good thing for people of all ages but, there are some books in the library that are not made for children to read or evan see	1
29146	4505	They should at least put them in a seprate part of the library	2
29147	4505	I had an experince like this once	3
29148	4505	I was about to leave to go to the library when my little brother asked if he could come with me	4
29149	4505	I didnt want to take him but I couldnt say no to him	5
29150	4505	He got his shoes on and he ran to the door, he was so excited	6
29151	4505	We pulled up to the library and he took off running to the doors	7
29152	4505	I chased after him, when I caught him I told him that he couldnt run away from me like that	8
29153	4505	We went inside, it was a giant library	9
29154	4505	He went to find a book to look at and I went to find a good book to read	10
29155	4505	I found one that looked very interesting I got it and started to read it	11
29156	4505	Then @CAPS1 ran to me and said I should go take a look at the book he was looking at, so I went with him to go see the book	12
29157	4505	He handed it to me and I just lost it, the book was not a children book at all	13
29158	4505	I was one of the worst book that I have ever seen, we left the library and never came back	14
29159	4505	I think that books that are bad for children should be in there own section in the library	15
29160	4505	This section should be for grown ups only and that no children are aloud in there	16
29161	4505	This is what I think sould be done to all libraries	17
29162	4506	Censorship in libraries has been a major concern in school systems for many years	0
29163	4506	In many school libraries certain books, music, movies, and magazines have been removed because of the content in them	1
29164	4506	These items can be removed for these common types of content wich include, use of violence, sexual acts, drug use, and inapropriate language	2
29165	4506	Many parents of young kids are always wondering what their kids are doing at school	3
29166	4506	Most parents would not want to find out that their kids are being introduced to such things at a young age, because it could influence them to participate in these activities	4
29167	4506	In my opinion I do believe that certain material in school libraries should be removed but not in public libraries because a public library can be divided into sections depending on age groups	5
29168	4506	Inn elementry and middle school libraries, items should be censored because young students do not need to be introduced to things that are inapropriate or violent in anyway	6
29169	4506	In a school environment kids should only be introduced to drug use, and sexual activity through some sort of health class because there is where they will learn the true facts and it would be more educational for them, rather than hearing about drugs, sex, and violence in a song or seeing some form of it in a movie	7
29170	4506	Many kids watch movies that have very violent, and inapropriate scenes, and some of the songs in the world today are exstreamly inapropriate for young kids	8
29171	4506	Their are also many books and magazines that should not be read by young students at school because of the content in them, this is why I do believe that censorship in libraries is a great thing.	9
29172	4508	I believe that censoring books in a library could be both good and bad	0
29173	4508	I think that there is different levels of censorship that should be enforced depending on the library at which censorship is required	1
29174	4508	In elementary school libraries, I think it would be appropriate to censor the books that are bought, and used in the library	2
29175	4508	Seeing that elementary kids are not as mature as say an adult, or a high school student, their level of reading is not as advanced as ours	3
29176	4508	Parents would definitely not want their children to be reading books that contain sex, drug usage, and any violence	4
29177	4508	This is because reading these books might put ideas into their heads	5
29178	4508	It @MONTH1 teach them things that they aren't supposed to do, and they @MONTH1 think that it is alright to act out on what they learn from a book	6
29179	4508	On the other hand, high schoolers, such as myself, are interested in those kinds of books	7
29180	4508	I am mature enough to know not to act out on what I read, and I am already aware of most of the things that books present	8
29181	4508	While most guys are into violent books about shooting, or football books, a lot of girls are interested in the romance type of books, that possibly express more then what most kids should know	9
29182	4508	In high schools, there should be less censory due to the fact that we are more mature and should be able to read what we are interested in	10
29183	4508	In public libraries, I think there should be sections of books based on age level, which most libraries do have already	11
29184	4508	This way parents taking their children to the library will know in which way they should direct them	12
29185	4508	Everyone is obligated to their own choices, whether that choice is to read books that are more likely to be offensive, is their choice	13
29186	4508	All in all, I don't think that books should be removed from the shelves if found offensive, because books are a type of out let to people	14
29187	4508	They can be educational, read for entertainment, or just read to keep you preoccupied	15
29188	4508	Books are everywhere, and people have every right to read whatever they please	16
29189	4508	On the other hand, I think it is a great idea to censor books, and categorize them to reduce the chances of young children running into books they aren't supposed to, and to keep all of their parents happy!	17
29190	4510	I think that censorship should be allowed in high school	0
29191	4510	For one, students who read books or watch the movies that are censorship can learn a lot from it.Also, I believe that if books are bad and not appropiate at school then why are they here	1
29192	4510	Movies that are not allowed becasue of its rating I think is lame because it might have pictures of naked people and bad language but we are high school students and we should be able to watch them because they are educational and we are mature enough to watch.Nevertheless, I believe that censorship is a good and bad thing but overally I think it should be allowed	2
29193	4510	Therefore, books or movies that are censored, shouldn't be because I personally think that students learn better from recent rated r movies then some @DATE1 movied thats in black and white	3
29194	4510	Kids pay more attention to good interesting movies and the old movies most student fall asleep or just doesn't pay attention at all	4
29195	4510	So after that, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools	5
29196	4510	If books and movies are so bad then why would they even have some here already	6
29197	4510	I think its foolish for teachers or administraters to think that we are to immature to watch rated r movies like every kid at school watches them at home,I believe	7
29198	4510	Yeah I know some movies show some scenes that arn't school related but who cares we will get over it	8
29199	4510	Overall I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools	9
29200	4510	Well then last point is that all these helps us in a way if you really think about it	10
29201	4510	Get a classroom with computers and for a week let them listen to music while they work and for another week dont let them listen to anything than see which comes out better	11
29202	4510	Personally listening to music makes me concentrate better and keeps me on coarse to get my work done.SO therefore, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools	12
29203	4510	So you got my opinion on censorship and I hope it helped you out to look at this situation better or clearer	13
29204	4510	I think rated r movies should be allowed at high schools and any music should to i mean its not like we are in prison,right	14
29205	4510	So there you got my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools	15
29206	4511	Should there be censorship in libraries	0
29207	4511	Some say there should be, some do not	1
29208	4511	Cultural books and magazines could be offensive to some readers	2
29209	4511	History in books can sometimes even be offensive depending on someones lifestyle or background	3
29210	4511	Are you wrong if you say you want censorship in the library	4
29211	4511	No, you are not wrong because there are many people who think that some books should be taken off of the shelves of there local libraries	5
29212	4511	Some of there reasons are because parents could have  young children and they do not want to expose them to such things while they are young and vulnerable	6
29213	4511	Others though say that censorship is unnecessary because people are going into the library and looking for a book at their own risk	7
29214	4511	Meaning that if someone goes to the library looking for a certain book and they pick up one they find as offensive, it could be a good book for someone else	8
29215	4511	Do all books that are considered 'offensive' have to be fiction	9
29216	4511	No, not all books have to be fiction if they are offensive	10
29217	4511	This does not mean that there aren't books out there like that	11
29218	4511	Cultural books or magazines from other countries or of a certain topic can sometimes be very graphic and have language that is only appropriate for certain ages	12
29219	4511	Everywhere in the @CAPS1 no matter where you are there are going to be things that could either interest you or be offensive to you	13
29220	4511	Everybody has there own opinion on the matter	14
29221	4511	The cultural @CAPS3 in the library are just showing how the people of othere countries live and act	15
29222	4511	It is not opinions or false claims in these @CAPS3, only fact	16
29223	4511	So cultural @CAPS3 should not be censored, although it could have a section just for that type of material	17
29224	4511	History books can be one of those @CAPS3 that really depends on your opinion or what you were raised in	18
29225	4511	Religion is one thing that history books can really raise offense to people because it could have some of the facts wrong about that type of religion	19
29226	4511	Some people would get very upset about how it was wrong because they are teaching the kids wrong about religion	20
29227	4511	Race and origin are another problem with some people	21
29228	4511	History books and elder's stories can always somehow be mixed and could cause trouble	22
29229	4511	For example if a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1 veteran told a story about what happened in a certain area	23
29230	4511	the history book could tell a completely different story	24
29231	4511	History books should not be censored because it is facts and teaching kids on what has happened in the past and how people survived	25
29232	4511	My views on the censorship of libraries is that there should not be any of it	26
29233	4511	Maybe the library could make a section for what people might think is 'offensive.'  @CAPS3 or books should definately not be taken off of the shelves though, because one man's offense is another man's great read	27
29234	4512	Today, millions of teens are bombarded with all kinds of media garbage	0
29235	4512	This can range from exposure to certain movies, music, magazines, books, or to even commercials	1
29236	4512	Parents, teachers, and even governments censor materials such as these to protect the students or the general population on topics that can be offensive or difficult to explain	2
29237	4512	However is that really the right choice	3
29238	4512	In life, we cannot shut our eyes and pretend that there are not harsh concepts out there in the world that we have to face	4
29239	4512	In fact, our parents and teachers should prepare us to be fully equiped when we go off on our own to find our place in the world	5
29240	4512	This then begs the question is it okay to censor certain books from the shelves of a library which can potentially enlighten us as growing students	6
29241	4512	When one conceals information, that person is stealing the right of knowledge	7
29242	4512	Not only that, but what one person finds offensive another can @MONTH1 not	8
29243	4512	This topic is just too abstract to be regulated	9
29244	4512	For example, take what Katherine Paterson said about how if everyone decided to work in this manner, all the books in the world wouldn't be available to any of us	10
29245	4512	Therefore censorship in libraries should be condemned because we are only hurting ourselves in the long run when we limit the knowledge we decide to take in	11
29246	4513	In our great country we have many freedoms, one of these is the freedom to read, hear, and see what we want	0
29247	4513	We all have different views that go with this freedom such as what we watch on televison, what we read in our spare time, and what music we like to listen to	1
29248	4513	However, if we had the right to remove things we do not like we will ruin the enjoyment for others	2
29249	4513	This would eventually remove our freedom	3
29250	4513	Many authors, musicians, and directors have stated that this freedom is important for having an enjoyable and creative life	4
29251	4513	We as individuals have different views on many things	5
29252	4513	Luckily our freedoms allow us to have these views without intefering with the views or ideas of others	6
29253	4513	If we removed the books, movies, magazines, etc., there would not be anything for anyone	7
29254	4513	Our libraries would be emptied, the classrooms would not have books, and the stores would not have anything	8
29255	4513	We should not have the right to remove what we think is innapropriate or does not follow our values or interests	9
29256	4513	Even though the right of removing things sounds like a good idea, we should consider the thoughts and ideas of others	10
29257	4513	Consider a public library, it has books for children, teens and adults with individual preferences, and a school library with books for children and teens with their own preferences on what they like to read	11
29258	4513	If we allow this right then these libraries which allow individuality would not be able to exist	12
29259	4513	People would be unable to live up to their freedoms of individualty	13
29260	4513	Everyone should be allowed to be themselves	14
29261	4513	Imagine what it would be like if we expanded this right to the foods that we buy	15
29262	4513	We all have different tastes of food that appal and satisfy us	16
29263	4513	The foods that we choose are a lot like the books we read, there are kinds we favor and others that we would just try to avoid	17
29264	4513	No one would have any food to eat at a restaurant, at school, or any where else not even at home	18
29265	4513	It would turn out to be a disaster	19
29266	4513	We should not have this right because it would not be fair to any one	20
29267	4513	Our views @MONTH1 be different but we have similar needs	21
29268	4513	The freedom we have is a freedom of choice	22
29269	4513	If we do not find a certain book, movie, or magazine to be appropriate we should choose to allow others to have the chance to pick it up and see if it fits their values and interests	23
29270	4513	Other people will  allow this chance too	24
29271	4513	After all, aren't individuality and choice what made the freedoms we have @DATE1	25
29272	4514	Should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive	0
29273	4514	Who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends	1
29274	4514	These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and issues among many people	2
29275	4514	Would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view	3
29276	4514	First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends	4
29277	4514	It is possible for anything to offend anyone	5
29278	4514	Also removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writter and the followers of the writter	6
29279	4514	Bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems then just letting the book remain on the shelves	7
29280	4514	If offending others is the issue then would it not be better to leave it alone over all, rather than making it an issue to please one group but inturn upsetting another	8
29281	4514	Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view	9
29282	4514	If books that offended people would have always been removed for reasons of offending other we could not have much of the knowledge we have today	10
29283	4514	For example a biology book might be offensive to people whos religion explains things differently and would make things untrue, and a religous document such as 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3' could be offensive to the people who believe the biology books to be true	11
29284	4514	If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would not have religion or modern science	12
29285	4514	This example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive	13
29286	4514	As a solution,  I believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone	14
29287	4514	If one person is pleased another is offended	15
29288	4514	If that person is pleased then the first person is offended	16
29289	4514	If books could possibly labeled as'some might take offensive' or 'material @MONTH1 be offensive' then people have a warning and they can choose if they want to read it or not	17
29290	4514	If they are offended they can not put blame on the author or where ever they got the book because there was a warning	18
29291	4514	It would  be just like the parental warnings on cd's	19
29292	4514	This @MONTH1 not fix the problem of people being offended, but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive	20
29293	4514	In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive	21
29294	4514	Books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning	22
29295	4514	That is just not an opition	23
29296	4514	Leaving books that offend certain people on the shelves @MONTH1 cause contraversy with others but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures are preformed, the issues should decrease greatly	24
29297	4514	Think about all this the next time you want a book to be removed from the shelves	25
29298	4515	I agree with Katherine's statement, but to a certain extent	0
29299	4515	If a book or magazine has cursing or anything offensive in it, then a student should take it to the librarian and let him/her know they are offended by it	1
29300	4515	Especially if it's in a middle school or elementary school	2
29301	4515	Of course there's going to be a book or movie or magazine that has something inappropriate in it	3
29302	4515	One day my friend and I were in the library looking for a book to read, and that's when I first discovered the @CAPS1 series	4
29303	4515	But as I got into the books, the more mature they got	5
29304	4515	In the last book, @ORGANIZATION1, it has a lot of profanity in it	6
29305	4515	But that doesn't mean I'm not mature enough to not know what it means	7
29306	4515	Same with any other high school student	8
29307	4515	But you can't protect your children from everything	9
29308	4515	Not even curse words	10
29309	4515	So if you see a book at a local library that is absolutely filled with offensive things, and you decide you want it removed, just take it to your librarian and comfront him/her	11
29310	4515	I'm sure they'll understand	12
29311	4515	Or maybe they won't, and they'll wait to see if anyone else will want it removed	13
29312	4515	My point is, you can't always protect your children from violent words or movies, or magazines	14
29313	4515	But you can always stand your ground and try	15
29314	4516	What impact does books that are for mature people have on kids	0
29315	4516	Recently people are trying to censorship libraries for what they seen what their kids are reading or have been acting lately	1
29316	4516	I disagree in censorshiping in libraries	2
29317	4516	Instead of censorshiping libraries maybe have a section for explict books or things for preventing little kids from reading them	3
29318	4516	First of all instead of removing all the books maybe you should consider making a section for only for people of certain age	4
29319	4516	Make a section in at the back of the library and ask for @CAPS1 to confirm that there old enough.This would let the libarary keep all their books and would keep all their construmers happy and the most important keep the parents happy	5
29320	4516	Another reason for not censorship libraries would be that the number of construmers would slowing drop	6
29321	4516	This would make the construmers unhappy and the library drop on its popularity for not having the books that people want to read	7
29322	4516	I can also see why they are trying to censorship libraries because of the kids behaviors	8
29323	4516	With censorship in libraries this would keep the little kids from acting the way they do in a book	9
29324	4516	But @CAPS2 would be better just to not censorship libraries and keep the people who does read them happy	10
29325	4516	At the end I disagree in censorshiping libraries because @CAPS2 would upset the people who read them and probably the library poplurity would drop which means people would stop visiting the library	11
29326	4516	So people that disagree should act now so libraries can stay how they are now	12
29327	4517	The @CAPS1 on Books     In the world today, everything is showed every place you look	0
29328	4517	Libraries are used by many people, people go there to research, study, and even just to find an interesting book to read	1
29329	4517	One of the problems that some poeple are having is the exposing of personal things	2
29330	4517	I believe that libraries should have a censorship	3
29331	4517	Why should libraries have one	4
29332	4517	Here are my reasons why	5
29333	4517	One reason why censorships in libraries are a smart idea is younger children search for books there	6
29334	4517	Any parent would tell you that they would strongly dislike the idea of their child reading something very detailed and adult like	7
29335	4517	A library should be a place where children, young adults and senior citizens can go to escape from reality not somewhere were they are worried about what book they might pull out from the shelf	8
29336	4517	If libraries still want to keep certain books in stock, they should start an age limit on those books	9
29337	4517	Limiting the age on books will stop younger audiences from viewing them	10
29338	4517	Another thing they could do with the age limiting is parents could set the age limit with the library on when their child should be allowed to view certain books	11
29339	4517	Also, another way that would help stop offensive viewing is parents looking at what their children are reading, watching and listening to	12
29340	4517	Parents could help by keeping an eye on what their child is doing	13
29341	4517	Cenorships are a wonderful way of stopping the viewing of adult like issues	14
29342	4517	More public places should start a system of them	15
29343	4517	The world needs to understand that some audiences aren't ready for reality just yet	16
29344	4518	libraries arcross the world contain all kinds of books, so good and some bad	0
29345	4518	theres always gonna be something in a book that @MONTH1 offend the reader or someone close to the reader	1
29346	4518	it just depends how sensitive people are	2
29347	4518	the main reason people want to ban books or have them removed from libraries is because of racial slurs, relgion, and sexual content	3
29348	4518	i think it should be the libraries choice to either put the book on the shelf or to take it down	4
29349	4518	magazines are an issue along with movies and different kinds of music	5
29350	4518	according to some libraries are just trashed with vulgar, racial, or bad movies, books, ect	6
29351	4518	if the parents are scared of there children being able to rent these things, they need to put some sort of block on them	7
29352	4518	if you want to rent bad things you should have to have parental permition	8
29353	4518	taking all of these things out of the library is not a soulution	9
29354	4518	all it does is create anger and leads to lawsuits and more	10
29355	4518	the library needs to make sections of different rated books so that kids wont be able to get the 'bad' books in there hands.alot of the nooks in libraries have meaning even if the book uses foul language or hate etc	11
29356	4518	it shows the mood of the story or how the charachter really feels inside	12
29357	4518	if stories like '@CAPS1 in The @CAPS2' didnt have anger, emotion, or the passion it has it would be a boring book	13
29358	4518	authors put language, sexual content, and violence in books, movies, and magazines to entertain certain crowds	14
29359	4518	if you take these things away certain people will not have the entertainment they have enjoyed with the things they have read or things could possibly read	15
29360	4519	@CAPS1          @CAPS1 a day where there are no books in the school library	0
29361	4519	A librarian walks through the now empty corridors, reminising of the days before censoring, before everyone told her of what they found offensive	1
29362	4519	Everyones ideas are different, but that absolutely does not mean they should have everyone else comply	2
29363	4519	Saying such, if someone finds a book offensive, they just should not pick it up	3
29364	4519	Just don't read it	4
29365	4519	By pushing to have the book taken out, they would be implying that they know best, and usually, they don't know best	5
29366	4519	A @CAPS2 could be offended by a fashion magizine in the library @LOCATION1 simply has an advertiziment for a body wash	6
29367	4519	She @MONTH1 say something like '@CAPS3 child shouldn't see things like this,' then demand it be taken out of the library	7
29368	4519	Does that make sense	8
29369	4519	I didn't think so either	9
29370	4519	In addition, if one woman was able to take a magazine out of the library, then another man or woman would believe they had the same power	10
29371	4519	Censoring could become a casual thing, and books could be thrown out daily	11
29372	4519	Now, that's only on a small scale	12
29373	4519	@CAPS1 if they actually took this up with higher authorities	13
29374	4519	That book would be taken away from all schools in the @LOCATION1 brings us to this problem	14
29375	4519	Should we, as people,as normal citizens, really decide what others are able to read	15
29376	4519	The answer to that is a definate no	16
29377	4519	Let's look on the other end of this now, too	17
29378	4519	What will happen to the authors who wrote the books that are now banned	18
29379	4519	As an example, I'll use @PERSON1	19
29380	4519	What would happen to her if the series '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' were banned from schools	20
29381	4519	Also, what about the kids that like to read	21
29382	4519	This is just taking good books away from the students...Because someone didn't believe in magic and threw a fit about it	22
29383	4519	That librarian from the beginning is leaving now, theres no more books to check out, bring back, or read anymore	23
29384	4519	The kids have to go to a public library to get all the books they want to read, and are then still discouraged from reading because the material wasn't proper	24
29385	4519	This shouldn't happen	25
29386	4519	Books do not need to be censored, and people who have a problem with a book just shouldn't ruin it for everybody	26
29387	4520	Censorship          Should certain materials (books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,) be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
29388	4520	I think it depends on how offensive the material actually is	1
29389	4520	If it is something very provacative or racist or advanced beyond the years of the people who have access to it, then it shouldn't be allowed	2
29390	4520	Or, the materials should be restricted or placed in a special section that only certain people have access to	3
29391	4520	It depends on the level of intelligence, maturity, and age of the people who have access to these materials	4
29392	4520	I don't think these materials should be removed, but restricted	5
29393	4520	Some of it should be left up to the school or library, but it is also a responsibility of the parents	6
29394	4520	If a child has permission to access a certain material, then they should be allowed to if their guardian thinks it is appropriate	7
29395	4520	Sometimes the guardians views @MONTH1 not be the same as a the library or schools, but it's mostly up to the guardian	8
29396	4520	Schools and libraries can't really argue with people's morals or intelligence	9
29397	4520	Over all, I don't think materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed unless it has been deemed necessary by a group of people that includes parents, teachers and/or school board memebers, and/or library staff	10
29398	4520	Just because one mom thinks a book is innapropriate for her child, doesn't mean it should be banned from another	11
29399	4520	Everyone has a different opinion and idea of what's acceptable, therefore it isn't fair for everyone to have to go by the idea of only one person	12
29400	4520	If you don't want your child to have access to a certain material, then simply don't let them access it	13
29401	4520	If you think it's not an appropriate material for any child to access, you can express that, but others @MONTH1 not agree	14
29402	4520	Materials considered innapropriate by a respectable group should be restricted or have a warning on them, but not a ban.	15
29403	4521	If you found a movie that you really enjoyed at the library, would you get mad if the library just tok it away and there was no other place to get it	0
29404	4521	If one person doesnt like something they see at the library doesnt mean its not educational, and just get rid of it	1
29405	4521	Just because somebody doesnt like the one thing doesnt mean another person will	2
29406	4521	I dont think they should get rid of movies, music, books, or magazines just because of one person	3
29407	4521	Here is somethings that will make you think about geting rid of all these catagories	4
29408	4521	One thing about movies that I like are they are good for visual aids	5
29409	4521	some people are better learners if they visualize something, they can get a better understanding of the purpose or the cause of the situation and they might learn faster	6
29410	4521	Another thing about movies in the library are becasue they show you things in the movie that you wouldnt be able to see if you were just reading a book	7
29411	4521	One thing that i like personally is that when people are in movies its like you are actually talking to me like me and the actor are really having a confersation	8
29412	4521	When you look at movie it gives you a visual picture of whats going on, even if the content isnt apropreate	9
29413	4521	Thats al the reasons why i think that movies shouldnt be taken away because someone thinks that the movies are volgure and not censored	10
29414	4521	Music is another rule that they shouldn't get rid of	11
29415	4521	Music is almost the only thing you can calm you down so that you can focus again	12
29416	4521	Another thing that music does to you, is it soothe's the mind so that you can relax and you wont bother anybody else	13
29417	4521	When you listen to music , it blocks out other sounds that you might get distracted from	14
29418	4521	so those are the reasons why music shouldnt be rid of	15
29419	4521	Magazine and books are the basics of a library	16
29420	4521	If you get rid of those, then it wouldnt be a library anymore	17
29421	4521	books are the basic learning methods of education	18
29422	4521	People learn the most information  out of a book or magazine	19
29423	4521	If you take those away its like your trying to hold people back from education and knowledge that they have in books	20
29424	4521	So if you get rid of magazines and books then it wouldnt even be a library any more	21
29425	4521	if you get rid of movies from the library then people want be able to have a visual aid as there alternative way of learning	22
29426	4521	If you get rid of music from the library, you wont be able to consintrate as well on one thing if your constantly getting disturbed by other noise around you	23
29427	4521	Last but not least if you get rid of books from the library then it would be a library anymore it will just be a place to go like any other place	24
29428	4521	The library wouldnt be anything any more	25
29429	4521	Now would you want that	26
29430	4521	thank you	27
29431	4523	Libraries are filled with books, magazines, music, movies, and many more materials	0
29432	4523	All of the materials cover a really wide range of topics	1
29433	4523	For example, movies can be a comedy, mystery, or adventure	2
29434	4523	However, some of this material is not suitable for some viewers and can be very offensive to them	3
29435	4523	For this reason, these offensive materials should be removed from libraries	4
29436	4523	One reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can lead to violence in teenagers	5
29437	4523	If a teenager is continually reading books or watching movies that have violence in them, then they might think violent behavior is all right	6
29438	4523	They might not know that violence is not the answer to many problems, and they will not realize that there are other solutions to a problem	7
29439	4523	One case that proves seeing offensive material can lead to violence occurred in a high school	8
29440	4523	A straight-A student got a grade she thought she did not deserve from a teacher	9
29441	4523	This student then painted her face white, put on red lipstick, and took a knife to the teacher's classroom during school	10
29442	4523	She then proceded to threaten to kill the teacher	11
29443	4523	She got the idea from the movie '@CAPS1', and her costume resembled the @CAPS2	12
29444	4523	Some students in the classroom at the time called @NUM1, and the police officers convinced the girl to put down the knife	13
29445	4523	Maybe if she had not seen the movie she would not have threatened to kill her teacher	14
29446	4523	Another reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because the material is sometimes inappropriate for younger children	15
29447	4523	The children might just be looking at books and magazines in the library and not even check it out	16
29448	4523	This way no one will know that they read it	17
29449	4523	Some of the books in libraries have subjects like sex and drugs in them	18
29450	4523	When the child reads this, he might want to do everything that is in the book	19
29451	4523	I have  read a book that contains sex and drugs	20
29452	4523	The book might put awful ideas into the child's head if he read it	21
29453	4523	After all is said and done, offensive material should be removed from libraries	22
29454	4523	The material can lead to violent acts in people, even if it does not seem like that kind of behavior could possibly come out of that person	23
29455	4523	The material can also be inappropriate for younger children	24
29456	4523	All in all, material in libraries can be offensive to some people.	25
29457	4524	Libraries have all kinds of books	0
29458	4524	Books for everyone	1
29459	4524	I think libraries shouldn't have to take books out because some people dont like it, or find it offensive, when others might like the author	2
29460	4524	If there is a book in the library that you find displeasin simpley don't cheak it out just put it back on the shelf and go on with your day	3
29461	4524	Like author Katherine Paterson said if we start taking book off the shelvies then there willn't be any books left to read	4
29462	4524	Yes, there are books out there that are not ment for little kids and some adults, but that's why you dont let them cheak them out till you think they are old enough	5
29463	4524	Just because you dont like the book doesn't mean noone else likes it	6
29464	4524	Everyone has there own tast in reading, as everything else	7
29465	4524	Libraries have sections for all ages	8
29466	4524	With books for there age	9
29467	4524	Like the childern's section is for little kid, and the adult section is for adults	10
29468	4524	Little kids shouldn't be cheaking out books from the adult section	11
29469	4524	Parents should take responsibility over there kids and watch what they'r doing	12
29470	4524	Then we wouldn't have to worrie about what they are reading, watching, or listening to	13
29471	4524	The libraries are doing just fine the way they are, and have been for years, and will for years to come	14
29472	4524	So no libraries shuold have to take sertain books off the shelves just because someone doesn't like it, or want there kid reading it	15
29473	4524	Just ignore that the book is even there and find another one that fits you'r liking	16
29474	4524	People learn alot from books, so if we get rid of most of them what will we lear from then	17
29475	4524	Books are a great part of history	18
29476	4524	Why get rid of you'r history	19
29477	4524	It's just wrong	20
29478	4524	Books shouold stay right where they are and belong.	21
29479	4525	Libraries have books that are short, long, and everything in between	0
29480	4525	Their are good and bad books, but that all depends on the opinion of the reader	1
29481	4525	There is no reason that if someone is offended by a book in a library that it should be removed from the shelf	2
29482	4525	The books on a shelf in the library are there for everyone to read so if one is removed then someone else is missing the chance to have the experience of reading that very book	3
29483	4525	Would you have some food destroyed if it didn't taste any good to you	4
29484	4525	No, you wouldn't get it again	5
29485	4525	So why'd someone have the right to remove a book because they were offended it isn't right your views on something are only an opinion nothing more	6
29486	4525	Your views are not the same as @PERSON1's who lives down the street so by removing a book it is pushing your views on somone else	7
29487	4525	In conclusion, the books in question could be good or bad in the eyes of the next person to read it	8
29488	4525	Pushy people aren't normally liked by others	9
29489	4525	Books are meant to be read and interpreted by the reader	10
29490	4525	That is why no one person has the right to take it off the shelf.	11
29491	4526	' Everyone in the world has an opinion, some people @MONTH1 find them offensive but there are also people who find it interesting and enjoy reading, listening, and watching the material	0
29492	4526	I personally have never had this kind of problem, i have only been to the library around @NUM1 times i generally rent movies	1
29493	4526	there are people who can noot deal with certain things like blood and guts or racism in books movis and music, but at the same time there are people who absolutely love it it's their thing	2
29494	4526	I believe that it would be wrong to strip those of what they find interesting what they enjoy to read or watch and listen to	3
29495	4526	some people will say well its vulgar well the people will say that its a master peice or that what they are into is dull and has no interesting moral	4
29496	4526	Libraries generally do not have things that are to gory or things that have too much sexual content they might in books but not movies or magazines	5
29497	4526	Now music nowadays can be down right vulgar and disrespectfull, it can also be very sexual and contain lots of gang related violence which has become a large problem with our children	6
29498	4526	Libraries generally have old school music like michael jackson, The @CAPS1, and slow jams like @CAPS2-kelly, and old smooth positive rap, good old country music, and nice soothing jazz	7
29499	4526	The music our children to nowadays has all of these depressing & violent morals that do not need to be shared with some of these young and imitatfull minds	8
29500	4526	I believe that they should not pull it off the shelfs but i do believe that you should have to be a certain age to acess these things.'	9
29501	4527	Today it seems as if anything you could imagine is out in the world somewhere, somehow	0
29502	4527	Whether it is found in a magazine, a book, music, or movies is irrelevant	1
29503	4527	The fact of the matter is, if good stuff is out there, then you can generally make the assumption that bad stuff is out there too	2
29504	4527	This bad stuff is sitting around on the shelves of our libraries nationwide waiting for someone to open it up and induldge in their naughty, intense, or graphic ways	3
29505	4527	As an @CAPS1, every man has the right to do or read what he wants	4
29506	4527	But what happens if it is not a man at all but in fact it is a child	5
29507	4527	This child is not choosing to read such bad things but just so happens to stumble upon it	6
29508	4527	Should they be punished for accidentally coming across this material and reading it	7
29509	4527	Which raises the question	8
29510	4527	who is to blame, and, what is the solution	9
29511	4527	It is a good and respectable idea to censor certain things in libraries but if someone wants to read something, they should be able to right	10
29512	4527	It is a very sticky situation and determining the answer should be a long and thought out process examining the issue from all angles, and different perspectives	11
29513	4527	The people that have brought this issue to the surface more than likely have personal experiences that make them feel so strongly on thier views of censorship in libraries, as have I	12
29514	4527	On a dry, blistering @DATE1 day I wanted to find something to do indoors	13
29515	4527	So instead of staying home all day I walked down to the library	14
29516	4527	I had been there a lot that @DATE1 and I was pretty familiar with their selection so I was looking for something new	15
29517	4527	So I strayed out of the kid section and browsed other areas of the library	16
29518	4527	There were so many choices and options right at the tip of my fingers	17
29519	4527	I got tired of reading all the titles so I did what generally any other kid would do, and something parents have been telling their kids for centuries not to do	18
29520	4527	I judged the books by their covers	19
29521	4527	I found one that looked interesting, and long story short I just so happened to stumble upon a love story	20
29522	4527	But not the kind I was used to	21
29523	4527	It was an adult book and want into vivid detail about the relationship of a sexually active older couple	22
29524	4527	Needless to say I was speechless	23
29525	4527	Reading that stuff as a child, scared mevery much so	24
29526	4527	Nevertheless it leads me to believe that it would be smart for censorship to be put into place in libraries	25
29527	4527	Of course, not every kid is going to have the same experience I did	26
29528	4527	In fact hardly any will	27
29529	4527	But I know that I was traumatized	28
29530	4527	So I can easily imagine how other people felt when the same thing or a realitively similar thing happened to them	29
29531	4527	But for all the other people that have not had things happen to them or that have not stumbled upon such material would probably think that it is unfair that things should be taken away from them just because other people could not handle it	30
29532	4527	But if you were like me, or any other innocent child that happened to find and experience certain things they just were not ready for would you not agree that censoring libraries is a beneficial thing to everyone	31
29533	4527	If you want things that are more intense or out there, then you can go to a bookstore, instead of a public library	32
29534	4527	I am a teenager and I do not have children but I can only imagine how you mothers and fathers out there would feel if it was their kids who were emotionally scarred from experiences they could have been shielded from in the first place	33
29535	4527	Kids should be kids and not have to be worried about the bad things in this world, and the most effiecient way to keep that the way it is, is to censor books, music, magazines and movies from the shelves of public libraries.	34
29536	4528	Everday hundreds of people visit your local library	0
29537	4528	The library offers and array of things such as books, music, movies, magazines and newspapers, but what 'limits' does the library have about the content of those things	1
29538	4528	All sorts of people go to the library	2
29539	4528	I go to the library, you go to the library, moms, dads, aunts, uncles, siblings, we all go to the library at one time in our life	3
29540	4528	Different crowds of people have different interests that @MONTH1 offend others	4
29541	4528	The question is, should we limit or rule out certain subjects in libraries	5
29542	4528	Limiting or censoring the mass media we have in our libraries would nearly empty them	6
29543	4528	Truth is, someone, somewhere is going to take offense to the items in most libraries	7
29544	4528	you can never please everyone	8
29545	4528	Also, some of these topics could be used for educational purposes	9
29546	4528	Take anatomy books for example	10
29547	4528	While high school and college srtudents use these books and diagrams to study, some mothers many find them inappropriate for their young children to see	11
29548	4528	This is why libraries have seperate sections for different audiences	12
29549	4528	There could be a childrens section, a 'tween' section, and an adult section to help with this issue	13
29550	4528	Also, everyone has different interests	14
29551	4528	I, personally, can not stand rap music but my sister loves it	15
29552	4528	Eventhough I find some of the things they say in those songs offensive it is my choice to listen to it or not	16
29553	4528	The song writers, singers, publishers, and authors who write this material have the freedom to do so	17
29554	4528	Who are we to tell them they can't write about sex, drugs or murduer because, face it, those things are part of our day to day lives	18
29555	4528	If children aren't seeing these things in libraries, they will eventually come across them else where	19
29556	4528	Should we remove 'offensive' material from libraries	20
29557	4528	No	21
29558	4528	If we do that there will be no books to read, no movies to watch or music to listen to because everyone will take offense to sometyhing.	22
29559	4531	Book Censorship     Censorship in libraries are a major problem in the @LOCATION1	0
29560	4531	The question is, 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out?' Or another question is, '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' @CAPS2 are very commonly asked questions, and should have attention put toward them	1
29561	4531	In my oponion, books should have a age limit on them	2
29562	4531	My reasoning is becuase, kids under @NUM1 years of age should have a place where they can find good books for thier age group	3
29563	4531	There are plently of books out there for all age groups	4
29564	4531	A kid under @NUM1, should not be able to check out a book, magazine, movie, or music that has offensive language, racial slurs, or dirty behivor from the character, or artist	5
29565	4531	Another reason @CAPS1 libraries should have a age limit on things you can check out, is becuase kids can get the wrong idea	6
29566	4531	Lets say, a book has a statment in it that says '@CAPS3, I went to my bestfreind's house and drank alcohol.' @CAPS4 would be somthing that a child should not able able to read	7
29567	4531	It would give the child the wrong idea in what they 'could' be doing	8
29568	4531	The age limits for book shelves should be as followed:@CAPS5 @NUM3 @NUM4 @NUM5 @NUM6 @NUM1-@CAPS6     @CAPS7 the books in @CAPS2 age groups would probably help stop the refrain on parents worrying about what their kid is reading	9
29569	4531	Plus, it would help the kid in deciding on what to read	10
29570	4531	I really think that @CAPS7 books in @CAPS2 age groups, will stop the commotion	11
29571	4531	Censorship is a major problem in the @LOCATION1	12
29572	4531	With everything I have listed, I am pretty sure that the questions, 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out?' and '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' with be answered	13
29573	4531	Age groups on books, is a great idea.	14
29574	4532	There are books up and down the shelves in the library that @MONTH1 make people wonder @CAPS1 they are up there	0
29575	4532	People @MONTH1 stand there and stare at a book and ask themselves, '@CAPS1 in the world is this book here?'  @CAPS2 many people @MONTH1 not know is that every book is in the world for a reason	1
29576	4532	Books published are in the world to teach about history, manners, literature, or they could be made to take you on an advantage	2
29577	4532	Of course you @MONTH1 come across a book that @MONTH1 be offensive to someone, maybe even yourself, but it is there for a reason	3
29578	4532	I once read a book that I found in our school library that was about slavery	4
29579	4532	It was a first person novel about a boy who was taken away from his family after being sold to a different plantation owner	5
29580	4532	Now some people would have been very offended by this book, because the @CAPS3 were calling the @CAPS4 all those names that the @CAPS4 do not like to be called	6
29581	4532	But that book helps people realize how much pain that slavery put on people	7
29582	4532	People can go to any library, from one in an elementary school to a public library, and you will always find at least one book about the @CAPS6	8
29583	4532	Just about everyone would get offended by one of these books, because nobody liked or does like @CAPS7, but they have to be there because of history	9
29584	4532	People can not just take the books out because it offends so many people	10
29585	4532	That would be like taking the @CAPS6 out of history, and that just can not happen	11
29586	4532	If it happened, it happened, and people have to know	12
29587	4532	Whether people admit it or not, they have ran into at least one book that has offended them	13
29588	4532	That will happen, it is almost natural for it to happen	14
29589	4532	But it would also offend people if you took books off the shelf	15
29590	4532	Those people know that books teach us, and we need books to know @CAPS2 is possible, @CAPS2 happened, and @CAPS2 might happen	16
29591	4532	Books are here for a reason, and they need to stay	17
29592	4533	I believe that certain materials,such as books,movies,magazines,etc, should not be removed if they are offensive to others because censorship and libraries has their own rights to have what they want on their shilves.Yes you @MONTH1 say that some things are unapropriate for children to see but there is an children side of every libraryso that children would not have to see unapropriate things.I feel as thought that no one has the right to tell another store where to locate their things	0
29593	4533	Also i can understand where the author is coming from but you would have to understand there is people oput there in the @LOCATION1 that would like to read or listen to unapropiate things that parent would not allow there children to see or listen to.I would also consider that @CAPS2, @CAPS1 dont let your child or children attend that library or that certain place where you know there is despictable materials there.Everyone has their own personal right to place there things where they want them to be	1
29594	4533	There are many other options,@CAPS2 can order their books online or go to the library with their child.When I was a young girl my mom never let mee go anywhere along so i never had to worry about seeing anything unapropriate or affensive.Now a days in @DATE1 children know right from wrong.Children know what they suppose to read and does not	2
29595	4533	I do also agree if a librarian or an adult see or hear children looking or listening to something i they know they should not be,They should stop the child or converscate them from the premises	3
29596	4533	So No i do not agree with you.I still think that people should have the right to place there things where they want because it is their stuff and their property.	4
29597	4534	Have you ever just read a book or a magazine that you just despised and thought that if that book was taken off of the shelf then it would save many people from a waste of time	0
29598	4534	Or have you ever read a book or heard a song that was not offensive to you, but to other people it might be offensive to their race or gender	1
29599	4534	A lot of people run into this problem and personally, I have ran into that problem, but that doesn't mean it needs to be taken off of the shelf	2
29600	4534	If everybody in the world goes to a library and grabs one book off of their own local library shelf to go and throw away, just one, that they absolutely despise because of their own personal reason or just because they didn't like it, there would barely be any books left	3
29601	4534	If somebody has a problem with the material in a book, magazine, or song, then don't read it or listen to it	4
29602	4534	Other people @MONTH1 like reading about that topic, or like that kind of music	5
29603	4534	I understand that some books @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but do not read it if you take it to offense	6
29604	4534	Books about slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but that is history and some people might like learning about that subject, or @MONTH1 even need that information for a research project	7
29605	4534	There are also many books on the @CAPS1, some people @MONTH1 find that offensive, or @MONTH1 not want their kids reading about that, but that is history	8
29606	4534	It's a time period in the past and it @MONTH1 be something a high school student is doing a research paper over	9
29607	4534	I have done a research paper over the @CAPS1 and I have read some very mature material that younger kids @MONTH1 not need to learn about right now, but I would not suggest to take every book over the @CAPS1 off of the shelves at our local library	10
29608	4534	There are many different reasons for reading a book and if you want to read a book for enjoyment and you end up reading one that you find offensive, then choose a different topic to read about because some people @MONTH1 like reading about that topic	11
29609	4534	Just because a person doesn't like a book or the topic the book covers does not give anyone the right to take the book off of the shelf because they feel that it is sending a bad message to younger kids or might be offending to some people	12
29610	4534	If people do not want their kids reading about that topic then tell them when they go to check a book out at the library not to get a book over that topic	13
29611	4534	If it becomes too big of a deal to where people begin to find a lot of books that offend them or other people, then suggest for the library to have a list of the books and their topics	14
29612	4534	Each library could be required to have a list of books, and have the suggested age of the readers beside it, or there could be different sections of the library	15
29613	4534	One section for kids, one section for teenagers, one section for adults, and one section for middle aged people	16
29614	4534	Also, if it absolutely needs to happen, each library can have computers to where you can look up the book and see what that book is about	17
29615	4534	This will give you an idea of what the book is about before you read it so if there is a certain topic that offends you then you can go ahead and find another book and find out what that one is about	18
29616	4534	This would help many people not read books that offend them and it would help them find a book that is more suitable for what they want to read about	19
29617	4534	Songs are a whole other subject	20
29618	4534	An artist or songwriter will write, rap, and sing songs about what they want	21
29619	4534	If people find the profanity in the song offensive, then do not listen to it	22
29620	4534	There is no way that you can tell a song writer not to sing or rap about what they want, and stores are going to sell albums that give them business	23
29621	4534	If people do not want their kids around that kind of language or message that the song is giving off then they can just tell their kids not to listen to it, because artists are going to write songs, rap songs, and sing songs about what is going to make them money, and that is just a fact.	24
29622	4536	To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3:          Censorship, does @CAPS2 deserve a place in our society	0
29623	4536	There has been much contreversy over this topic	1
29624	4536	Some claim that certain kinds of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings, while others, over the same topic, believe the complete opposite	2
29625	4536	They believe that the words of the artists and authors shows feelings and have messages hidden within words of vulgarity, which is where i stand on the situation	3
29626	4536	@CAPS2 seems as though everytime we cross over this bridge, @CAPS2 comes right back in front of us	4
29627	4536	Many of those opposed to the freedom of writing and music are usually the ones that feel as if they must preform proper edicate and have everyone act nothing less of the same, unfortunately for many, the people that are like this, usually, have much power in the say of what comes and what goes, not allowing many of us lower graded people in society to get a chance to veto their poor outlook on things	5
29628	4536	My opinions bring me to believe that there are two sides to this story too	6
29629	4536	However, I still believe that much of what is considered 'censored' material should not be censored at all	7
29630	4536	There is one, count that, one situation where I feel censorship is necessary	8
29631	4536	One is songs that go on for @NUM1 and a half minutes saying nothing but '*bleep* this, and *bleep that'	9
29632	4536	All other material, whether @CAPS2 be @CAPS4 rapping or @PERSON1 writing, is acceptable	10
29633	4536	There's just many people in the world who need to grow up and listen to the lyrics/words, to get the full message before automatically assuming that there is a problem with @CAPS2	11
29634	4536	Great @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, he always has a message in his music, whether @CAPS2 be about family or just life in general, however many words he uses are considered unfit for our time, so you just hear '*bleep*' when @CAPS2 is on the radio	12
29635	4536	By just that '*bleep*', you can lose the message thats coming across	13
29636	4536	Also, ever hear the phrase, 'equal rights'	14
29637	4536	Well, shouldn't music and literature be a right	15
29638	4536	@CAPS2's just like talking but with either pages or instruments	16
29639	4536	And that's how I will leave you on this debateable topic	17
29640	4536	I hope I might have changed some opinions of you today, if not then your loss	18
29641	4536	Thank you for your time	19
29642	4536	A @CAPS6 to the @CAPS7,                                                     @LOCATION1	20
29643	4537	Everybody had their favorite movie, song, or book when they were younger	0
29644	4537	Sometimes these types of media aren't exactly child friendly	1
29645	4537	Songs today hint at sexual activities	2
29646	4537	Books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published	3
29647	4537	There are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness	4
29648	4537	Does that mean they should be limited by a public place, such as a library	5
29649	4537	Several people would agree, but I disagree	6
29650	4537	Growing up, @PERSON1 was the wonder of my world	7
29651	4537	Her music was fun and unbeat, making a sunny day even more enjoyable	8
29652	4537	Her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing, until you thought about it a little more deeply	9
29653	4537	Even looking at the music videos, they show actions and images little children shouldn't be copying	10
29654	4537	Some @MONTH1 restrict their child from such material, but I would call that depriving a child of there freedom	11
29655	4537	You can go to any public library and look through numerous selections of books, dvd's, cd's, and even magazines	12
29656	4537	Some library's even have computers available to the public	13
29657	4537	Not all places will carry your favorite aritist, movies, or reading material tho because they believe it isn't something little children should be indulging in	14
29658	4537	Who is to say a little kid can't enjoy the material that they'd like	15
29659	4537	That's like taking away part of a person's originality	16
29660	4537	A child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a one mind track	17
29661	4537	Limiting a child's media could benefit them in some way	18
29662	4537	Restricting time on computers, limiting the amount of hours playing video games or watching television could help teach a child time managment skills	19
29663	4537	Most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult and it could get them into trouble	20
29664	4537	Library's shouldn't have to take the offensive media off the shelves though	21
29665	4537	Age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set	22
29666	4537	Just because a book or movie has language and images that shouldn't be seen by children is made, does not mean a library should limit that access to the public	23
29667	4537	Restrictions on renting that material could be set	24
29668	4537	It would solve all issues, in my opinion	25
29669	4537	In conclusion, censorship in public library's could be beneficial, but they should just set an age renting limit instead of removing all material alltogether	26
29670	4537	Therefore, making parent's happier and not restricting a person's freedom to develop there own opinion's and liking's of the different types of media	27
29671	4538	Do you believe in hiding books and movies that are over @CAPS1	0
29672	4538	Do you think that children can control themselves with offensive behavor	1
29673	4538	Have you ever seen a child watch a scary movie that was @CAPS2 @CAPS3	2
29674	4538	Why do you think that most parents block that kind of viewings from their young children	3
29675	4538	I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves from children, if they are found offensive	4
29676	4538	I fully agree with adults not letting children watch that new scary movie or that action book their brother is reading	5
29677	4538	I think they should consider the effects that come with watching or reading certain things	6
29678	4538	Children at young ages still have their innocence	7
29679	4538	You don't want your child having nightmares because you let them watch a over @CAPS1 rating movie	8
29680	4538	You would feel guilty if the child has problems for the rest of their life	9
29681	4538	You have to make a choice on whether the it's comfortable for them to view what their watching or reading	10
29682	4538	It's important to hid them so the child can not get ahold to them	11
29683	4538	Be wise of the kind of movies and books you leave around the library	12
29684	4538	You should have a section for children in libraries	13
29685	4538	You should have all the materials that a child should be interested in	14
29686	4538	It should be colorful and playful as possible	15
29687	4538	I used to watch this girl named @CAPS5	16
29688	4538	I was babysitting her one night, while her parents were at the movies	17
29689	4538	I brung a movie to watch, when @CAPS5 fell asleep	18
29690	4538	So once the clock turned to @NUM1, I put her to sleep	19
29691	4538	But little did I know she woke up and @ORGANIZATION1 me watching this horror film called @ORGANIZATION1	20
29692	4538	It gushed blood everywhere and she started to sceam	21
29693	4538	I thought I had secured her in her bedroom, to go to sleep but to my surprise she was still woke	22
29694	4538	I rushed over to her and put her back to sleep	23
29695	4538	hoping she didn't have any nightmares	24
29696	4538	Please be curtious to the things youlet children read or see	25
29697	4538	You have to think of the effects of what's going to happen to the child later in life	26
29698	4538	I know you think that it's not that harmful to children, but it can really mess up their minds and actions forever	27
29699	4538	So I hope I have persuaded you to follow my advice and pull them over @CAPS1 movies and books off the shelves for the safety of the children	28
29700	4539	Everyone is @CAPS1          @CAPS2 person is @CAPS1, this much we can agree on	0
29701	4539	So why then would people try to put a censorship on books, movies, magazines, and etc., as i pointed out before, we all are @CAPS1 so we all have @CAPS1 standards on what is bad and offensive to what is good	1
29702	4539	When we remove a book from a library shelve for whatever reason we have to do so then others should have the same right to do so as they see fit	2
29703	4539	If  picked up a book on why @CAPS3 is the right religion and i am a @CAPS4 then more then likely i will find it offensive	3
29704	4539	Yet if i gave that same book to a @CAPS3, that person would mostly likely read that exact same book that the @CAPS4 read and find it not offensive at all	4
29705	4539	It all comes down to the veiws we all have about everything so why would you let one person or even a small comittee set standards on library censorship for they @MONTH1 feel one way while another comittee or person feels completly @CAPS1	5
29706	4539	Everyone is @CAPS1 and feels diferently about issuses	6
29707	4539	There is no way to make sure that @CAPS2 book in the library won't offend a single person	7
29708	4539	The same issue can be applied to music, movies, magnazines and ect	8
29709	4539	No matter what we do, some one will be offended	9
29710	4539	For example, the plege of allegiance is something my school says everyday, yet some people, like a @ORGANIZATION1, find it offensive	10
29711	4539	All acrosss the nation people say it before school, a sportinh game, or ect., yet you don't see very many people objecting to that	11
29712	4539	I have obsereved that most people who find it offensive just ignore it so why can't we do the same for books, movies, magazines, and etc	12
29713	4539	that we @MONTH1 find offensive	13
29714	4539	In conclusion, there really is no way to put a cencorship in libraries since no matter to tell what a person might or will find offensive	14
29715	4539	So why then can't we just not read what offends us, this really is the only way to keep from offending  people	15
29716	4539	For these reasons, I feel that there should not be a cencorship in libraries	16
29717	4540	Throughout the history of literature, many books have been banned from public libraries and shelves	0
29718	4540	They are all somehow offensive to certain people, but not to all	1
29719	4540	Even some books that include magic and fiction have been expelled from some societies, simply because of certain religions and cultural backgrounds	2
29720	4540	I believe that there should never be a piece of literature completely banned from public eye	3
29721	4540	When a book is banned, a piece of history is removed from others' sight	4
29722	4540	A book that @MONTH1 have been banned in the @DATE1 could not have been read by my mother or father	5
29723	4540	My future children and I could also never be able to read it	6
29724	4540	Materials that are removed from the public are generally removed because of one specific group which complains about its content	7
29725	4540	When I was about eight years old, I remember seeing on the news that people in @LOCATION1 and other @CAPS1 @CAPS2 countries were burning books from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series, only because it contained magic and ridiculous fiction	8
29726	4540	Maybe they were being burned because the @CAPS5 looked down upon its story and its fictional stories, but that does not mean it should be banned from the libraries	9
29727	4540	The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series is one of the most popular pieces of literature of my generation, and generations after mine should be able to enjoy it as much as we did	10
29728	4540	Before the beginning of @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10, the @CAPS11 were starting to be discriminated against	11
29729	4540	They were treated as sub-humans, like in this example	12
29730	4540	There was a night in @DATE2 called @CAPS12, when radical @CAPS13 and @CAPS14 supporters burned @CAPS11' houses, stores, and even books	13
29731	4540	Some of those books could have been the only copies, yet the @ORGANIZATION1 let their hate overcome them and destroyed the pieces of @CAPS16 literature	14
29732	4540	Because the @ORGANIZATION1 found the @CAPS16 work offensive, the generations after @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 can never read the books burned during @CAPS12	15
29733	4540	In Katherine Paterson's quote, she says, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	16
29734	4540	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe she is correct in this quote	17
29735	4540	If literature keeps being censored, there will be none left for future generations to enjoy	18
29736	4540	No literature should be censored, not even the most radical, magical, or fictional	19
29737	4540	If censorship continues, the future of literature is doomed.	20
29738	4541	There are many works out in modern times which can be considered provacative or offensive	0
29739	4541	Some are even unfit for young eyes	1
29740	4541	There are many reasons that some will come up with for removing these books from their shelves, but I believe that no one, politician or artist alike, should have the right to put down someone else's work	2
29741	4541	There are definitely books in libraries that wouldn't be dreamt of being checked out by the ordinary person, but these books should not be put down	3
29742	4541	I don't believe that a person's work, which is instilled with hope, money, beliefs, and elbow grease should be removed from public	4
29743	4541	No matter how offensive or wrong some @MONTH1 be, it is their work and their time, and their heart and soul which they put into a book	5
29744	4541	It is the truth that this has been done in the past to keep down rebellions and shifts in power, but nevertheless, I still disagree	6
29745	4541	For example, even today @PERSON1's @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is illegal to even have in @LOCATION1	7
29746	4541	This is for a specific reason, of course, and not a bad one at that, but I believe that this book should still be available so people can read and learn from the past	8
29747	4541	As it has been for many centuries, the ability to publish a book means the ability to be remembered forever, and many people put their soul into the book they write	9
29748	4541	These books represent the ability to think freely, and if one is to remove books from society, then one is to remove free will and free thinking from society as well	10
29749	4541	This is accentuated especially in the dark psychological science fiction novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS3 @NUM1	11
29750	4541	This book is almost prophetic in the descriptions of future society from the perspective of a person from the @DATE1's, and almost totally accurate as to what would happen if one was to take books out of society, and was even censored itself for a long time	12
29751	4541	Of course, it conveys the extremist view of censorship, and probably won't happen in the near future, at least	13
29752	4541	It is, however, a dark omen of what is to come is censorship is freely given power	14
29753	4541	There are many views that one can have on a single topic, book, or idea	15
29754	4541	That doesn't mean, however, that if it is viewed as wrong it should be put down	16
29755	4541	This applies to music, movies, magazines, websites, and books alike	17
29756	4541	If one removes these from society in any form, then at a raw standpoint, they are removing a piece of flavor and individuality from society	18
29757	4541	If censorship is given free reign, even if it is simply over the 'extremist' or 'radical' ideals, then people will never have the full ability to learn from their mistakes and know what to do about the future, which will simply be history that will be repeating itself	19
29758	4541	Of course, it is not my viewpoint that governments should simply let terrorists and radicals spread their ideals as they please	20
29759	4541	Once one is proven to be a threat or menace to the public, then they should most definitely be taken into custody and convicted of their wrongs.There is no doubt in my mind that the law should be upheld, but it should not overextend its boundaries	21
29760	4541	Censorship, as a whole, is a helpful process for the benefit of the public, but all in all it removes the ability to see the raw, cold truths of life	22
29761	4541	This keeps some from ever learning how to be safe truly, and how to think and believe in their ideals	23
29762	4541	When politicians step into the boundary of art, music, literature, and even education to an extent, and try to keep it from flourishing as it naturally would, then something must be done	24
29763	4541	I'm not inciting a rebellion, but I truly do not believe that politics should rule over the artistic soul of the average man	25
29764	4541	That in itself is how society becomes self-destructive and loses its concern and connection with the world	26
29765	4542	Many different people have views on what they want their children to be exposed to, whether it be in books, movies, music, or any other type of media	0
29766	4542	So should libraries be more strict and remove certain items that might come across as offensive or vulgar to parents or even students	1
29767	4542	I believe that it completely depends on how a library advertises or who they allow to check out what	2
29768	4542	I know that a certain case, specific to me, is that my mother did not like me reading a specific series becasue she thought that it was not an appropriate reading material for me	3
29769	4542	Because of that, that does not mean she marched down to the library and demand that they get rid of all the books written by that author	4
29770	4542	She respected the fact that others enjoyed reading the books and just asked me to steer clear of them and to find something more appropriate for me to read	5
29771	4542	In many libraries, I know that they have certain areas for specific age groups of people like children, teenagers, and adults	6
29772	4542	Within those specific designated areas, they have kind of 'sub-area' where they seperate educational from entertainment and so on	7
29773	4542	Let's say one parent gets offended by a specific section, such as a sex education section, should they ask the library to remove it completely	8
29774	4542	I do not think that will help anything because there are students who use that topic for areas they are studying and parents who use it as educational tools with their own children	9
29775	4542	I do believe that libraries should put stamps or notices on their different types of media saying that only a certain age group is aloud to look at them and be able to check them out	10
29776	4542	An eight year old should not be able to go in and get a @NUM1 movie whenever they want to	11
29777	4542	There should be restrictions on areas like that, but for someone to come in and say to take out all the @NUM1 movies is a ridiculous thing to do because there are others who enjoy that type of entertainment	12
29778	4542	Libraries to respect the fact that there are different types of people with different interests and they try to make their environment as comfortable for everyone as possible	13
29779	4542	They will have children's videos seperate from the adult videos and they even have a whole seperate section of books for them to discover and journey into	14
29780	4542	The only thing that I believe should not be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos	15
29781	4542	A library is still a public, family area, after all, and no child should accidentily stumble upon any raunchy article	16
29782	4542	So, should libraries completely remove areas of media	17
29783	4542	I do not think so	18
29784	4542	I think that they should distinguish from adult's and children's materials	19
29785	4542	Katherine Paterson says, 'But if I have the right to remove books from the shelf 	20
29786	4542	then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	21
29787	4542	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we continue to take books off of the shelves then eventually there will be nothing to read.	22
29788	4543	People @MONTH1 have a certain reason to take something off the shelves like books, magazines, @CAPS1, etc	0
29789	4543	Whether those reasons be personal or professional it rather important	1
29790	4543	Some @MONTH1 find the material offensive to themself	2
29791	4543	Others might find it inappropriate to have something like that available to the younger generation	3
29792	4543	And writing or music could be thought of as unneccessary and irrelevant	4
29793	4543	The world holds many things that can be found offensive to someone	5
29794	4543	That someone could be an educated person or a high school dropout	6
29795	4543	Out of all of the stuff in the world someone is going to find something offensive to them or other people	7
29796	4543	It can be a phrase that an author uses or the name of a song	8
29797	4543	But to take something away from the people is not right and shouldn't be allowed unless it is highly offensive	9
29798	4543	They could choose to stay away from that sort of thing	10
29799	4543	Unless the offender is very public and offends pratically everyone, should it then be removed	11
29800	4543	Other material could just be blatantly inappropriate for some to have access to	12
29801	4543	If there was a book on how to rob a bank or how to make cocaine then it should be removed because that would cause problems that could have never happened	13
29802	4543	People might learn how to do those things anyway but by allowing that to be public information would be like starting a fire that will get widely out of hand	14
29803	4543	Of course, anyone can get the notion to do something from anything they read but that is how they interpret it	15
29804	4543	Some things out there are just inappropriate for the world and all the people on it	16
29805	4543	If you listen to a @CAPS2 and they singer or rapper starts using profanity and disrespecting a race or gender when they haven't done anything to anyone it would be unneccessary	17
29806	4543	Something like that should not be allowed in the first place and it is bad enough to be done to another singer but to talk about a race or culture in inexcusable	18
29807	4543	Or if a writer writes a story about someone, for example who just recently saved peoples lives, saying they were a horrible person and did terrible things to people when they only a little about the person and heard barely any of the story	19
29808	4543	In conclusion, in certain instances the people should have the right to take away something that is extremely offensive not just to them but to a large amount of people.Or if the material can cause problems that should not have started	20
29809	4543	And if the writing or music is inappropriate to a race or culture should it be removed	21
29810	4543	Everyone has their rights and if writing, music, and videos are putting them down they should have the right for it to be taken from access.	22
29811	4544	My opinion on this would be that , they are going to learn about @CAPS3 anyways so why take @CAPS3 off the shelfs 	0
29812	4544	No I don't think any adult material should be cencered 	1
29813	4544	You know when your little girl or boy as about what they have in there hand , simple just take @CAPS3 from them and say '@CAPS1 your eyes can't handle .' @CAPS2 , they are going to ask questions and @CAPS2 , they will start to wonder , but they learn that stuff in school anyways so what's the big deal 	2
29814	4544	If I had a child , who had got into my personal stuff and started asking questions , I would simply tell them '@CAPS3's a mommy and daddy thing ' , and then hide @CAPS3 in a diffrent place to where I know they can't find @CAPS3 	3
29815	4544	I mean , when you was a child , of course your parents would have yelled at you for going into there room and looking threw there stuff , but then again , you would yell at them for having @CAPS3 when they got older 	4
29816	4544	So don't disaplin your children for @CAPS1 they 'stummbled' on to , you should learn how to hide your stuff better 	5
29817	4544	I'm not saying I would have any of that stuff (why would I need @CAPS3 ?) but , as a student looking into the future , I have a opinion 	6
29818	4544	Now lets say that you have a couple of maginzines under your bed and your child happens to see them 	7
29819	4544	@CAPS2 they will start looking at them , and some words might come out , but that does not mean they did @CAPS1 wrong , @CAPS3's the parents fault 	8
29820	4544	Like I said before I would hide my stuff better but , then again , I don't need that kind of stuff to live a happy life , I have my children and my husband and that is all I'll ever need 	9
29821	4544	So before you parents decide to protest about the library having stuff that children are not suppose to see , check your room , hide your stuff so you wont be the embarassed one 	10
29822	4544	No , a library can have whatever they want , @CAPS3's not your place to say what they should get ride of and what should stay.As a student , I stand up and say , No , adult material should not be banned from library's , then you would here the adults complaining and that is @CAPS1 we don't need .	11
29823	4545	The question was asked 'Do you believe certian matierals, such as books, music, movies, moagazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive,' No	0
29824	4545	By taking away these things, such as books, music, magazines, or movies off the self, that @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' your taking away things that people enjoy	1
29825	4545	Not many people including me would agree with the passage of censorship on items like these	2
29826	4545	So should we do this, I dont believe that we should	3
29827	4545	There are many reasons that this should not be passed	4
29828	4545	First by using this censorship, you might lose more customers in that store selling these such items	5
29829	4545	Once the store has lost customers, they lose money, then they might even lose their store	6
29830	4545	A lot of people like things that dont have any limits to them	7
29831	4545	They often find their joy in these things	8
29832	4545	I know that i, myself like reading books, listening to music that has no limits	9
29833	4545	So if your taking them away or puting limits to it, are people really gonna want to have these things	10
29834	4545	Secondly, if there is really an issue with books and etc, that are not suitable for kids, then put the books and etc,  in catogories	11
29835	4545	These catorgories would put the things not suitable for children, apart from the ones that children should be reading	12
29836	4545	Since there are no real solutions besides banning these items, this would be the best plan	13
29837	4545	Finally, as katherine paterson stated 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self.' If this is really a problem then the the parents need to watch what their child is reading, because it isn't right to have everything taken away from the society just because the parents are concerned with what their child is reading	14
29838	4545	So what do you think, should this be such a law	15
29839	4545	The choice is yours	16
29840	4545	Just remember though, if you agree with this then	17
29841	4545	Just think of everything you are taking away from other people, do you really want to be that heartless?	18
29842	4546	Censorship is a matter of great contention today	0
29843	4546	Many authority figures have seemingly become obsessed with the notion that literature, video games, movies, and music are responsible for the perceived corruption of today's generation	1
29844	4546	Many believe in the idea of censorship because it will protect their children and allow them to remain innocent and morally upright	2
29845	4546	However, I believe censorship is a grand mistake on our part	3
29846	4546	Denying children access to certain literary works only keeps them ignorant, not innocent	4
29847	4546	so many books today are censored, and yet the information contained in them could have been vital to children who are seeking an understanding of the world they live in	5
29848	4546	One of the most difficult questions about censorship is the matter of what should be censored and what should not	6
29849	4546	Books that are viewed as offensive or controversial are the usual targets, but viewing something as being offensive is just thata view	7
29850	4546	It changes from person to person because of varying cultures, religions, and moral codes	8
29851	4546	No one can agree on what will have a negative impact on children, making it impossible to establish a standard of what is best left off the shelf	9
29852	4546	The problem this creates is that many valuable books that should be permitted reading material are instead unavailable	10
29853	4546	Censorship can protect a child from information they are better off not knowing, but it also robs them of a chance to gain vital knowledge	11
29854	4546	Children should be encouraged to read and to learn, not blocked from doing so	12
29855	4546	Yet if this is truly the case, why does the censorship debate still rage	13
29856	4546	The argument continues because, in truth, there really are things that ought to be censored	14
29857	4546	Movies, music, and even books today can be very violent or sexual in nature, and these inappropriate subjects can have a negative impact on youths	15
29858	4546	Bloody video games and hateful song lyrics can encourage animosity towards others in children	16
29859	4546	But that cannot be the sole cause of such behavior	17
29860	4546	children will act right if they are taught how, not if they are hidden away from every instance of wrong	18
29861	4546	Censorship is greatly inferior to proper life lessons about morality, equality, peace, and respect	19
29862	4546	Inevitably, censorship will remain a common practice	20
29863	4546	But try this: think of a book that changed your life for the better, and then imagine if you had been denied access to reading it	21
29864	4546	Do you want to let your children miss out on an experience that could very well mean the world to them?	22
29865	4549	What I belive is that certain material should be allowed on a shelf	0
29866	4549	The time it takes an author to write a book, is very long	1
29867	4549	It could be their passion to write, so why would you want to take that away	2
29868	4549	Every person has an opinion, which is allowed to have by freedom	3
29869	4549	Material in libraries are sorted by age group, and as long as the material is fitted for that age group, there should'nt be a problem	4
29870	4549	There are many books that some people do not want their children to read, but the books actually help children learn	5
29871	4549	For example, a book that you think is boring could actually be interesting to another person	6
29872	4549	There are many opinions in the world, that is why there are so many differnt kinds of books	7
29873	4549	If you took away a book or certain material off the shelf, how could that help a child	8
29874	4549	Yes it could have bad words or beliefs, but it could help someone	9
29875	4549	If a person is a loner or just likes to be by them selves, they could learn from the character's mistake in the book	10
29876	4549	Many children these days are getting bullied or pick on, and don't want to tell an adult	11
29877	4549	If there was a book that they read about a person being bullied, maybe it would encourage them to tell a teacher	12
29878	4549	Yes I agree, every material has something in it that another person does not like	13
29879	4549	There are a couple books that I did not approve of, myself, but I know that it has connected with a child some where in the world	14
29880	4549	Every person does not grow up in the same conditions, but material could teach them	15
29881	4549	You should stop and think if you was a writer, would you want someone to throw your hard work in the trash	16
29882	4549	Every time there is a big rally about an author writing about a certain belief, there is negative thoughts	17
29883	4549	No one stops and thinks about someone else or their family	18
29884	4549	All they care about is their own family	19
29885	4549	Even the author's family is embarassed of the rally, but no one stops and thinks of their family and how they feel	20
29886	4549	Think about you opinion, does anyone care about what you think	21
29887	4549	That is why as a person, we should not bring down someone's opinion, and let them say what they believe on paper	22
29888	4549	How would you like it, if someone threw your belief or opinion in the trush	23
29889	4549	If there is a rally about a material in the library, next time think before you judge	24
29890	4549	Would you want someone judging your belief or opinion?	25
29891	4550	Alot of things can be found offensive now days, but that does not mean you take it away from others who enjoy it	0
29892	4550	Everyone has their own view, and opinon on things	1
29893	4550	For the things people find offensive I believe they should just simply stay away from it	2
29894	4550	No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the library shelves	3
29895	4550	Somethings people @MONTH1 find offensive others might enjoy	4
29896	4550	Its simple, if it comes to the point were people are causing problems then maybe that will be up to the people that work in the libraries	5
29897	4550	Yes, there @MONTH1 be alot of things that people take offensive, but that dose not mean take away the things others @MONTH1 enjoy	6
29898	4550	I have been to many libraries in my life	7
29899	4550	I have not really seen anything offensive, but I have seen some books and movies for adults only	8
29900	4550	Honestly in my eyes its simple, if there is something you find offensive just stay away from it, because others @MONTH1 enjoy it	9
29901	4550	Its not up to me weather the materials should be removed from the library shelves	10
29902	4550	Although I do believe that people who find things offensive should just stay away from it	11
29903	4550	You have to take things into consideration before jumping straight into conclusions.	12
29904	4551	This essay is about cenorship for the libarys well their shouldn't because alot of this stuff is on tv like comedy centreal, @ORGANIZATION2	0
29905	4551	@CAPS3,mtv and alot of channels	1
29906	4551	should music be cenorship no because the blanks can ruin the beats, rythem, and the lyrics	2
29907	4551	The cenorship ruins how the song goes and it makes people mad because they like a certain song but if they want to listen to it they have to get on a computer	3
29908	4551	Websites they can get on to listen to it is @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, and alot more	4
29909	4551	Movies shouldn't ethier its the parents pick if they didnt want the kids to watch or hear the things they do dont pick it or tell the kids to go to their rooms	5
29910	4551	Books!!	6
29911	4551	should not i repeat should not be cenorship because what if the adults want to read them	7
29912	4551	That aint fair for them cause all of this is a about kids	8
29913	4551	Kids are smart about this they know what to read and what they shouldn't read	9
29914	4551	T.V	10
29915	4551	shows	11
29916	4551	is best thing ever their alot of shows thats funny,awesome,thriller,and alot more	12
29917	4551	But its gets to you	13
29918	4551	Here a example @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS3, and more plays alot of good movies but since they have block out the words and parts of movie it really dont make sense to watch it because their not parts they really haved seen and they have to go rent it or buy it	14
29919	4551	To see the movie	15
29920	4551	Am i right	16
29921	4551	All i am saying the cenorship ruins alot of tv shows movies and music and nobody wants that	17
29922	4551	It's ruins the enteriment for people and that sad to see cause actors, music writers, writers, and alot more speanded alot of their time for the fans and work	18
29923	4551	When they can be with their familys!!	19
29924	4551	Well this is the end of my essay	20
29925	4552	There is material out there that some people consider offensive and or have material in them that we don't want our youth to indulge in	0
29926	4552	Such items can include music, books, and movies, but I am just going to give you some of my thoughts on the issue	1
29927	4552	On materials, like music and movies, there are ratings on the item saying what age is apropriate for the content that the music or movie have in them	2
29928	4552	Like movies there are ratings such as @CAPS1 which means that you should be @NUM1 or older to view it	3
29929	4552	@NUM2 which is parental guidance or @NUM3 and up	4
29930	4552	PG means you should have your parents with for the younger kids	5
29931	4552	And @CAPS2 which is for all age groups	6
29932	4552	If there is something offensive and or the language is bad in music the cover will have a lable that says explicit content	7
29933	4552	I agree with this	8
29934	4552	I don't think that they should take anything off of the shelf unless completely nescessary	9
29935	4552	If someone doesn't like the content in that item they have the option to not listen, watch, or read it	10
29936	4552	There are people out there that might disagree with me and I can see where they are coming from too	11
29937	4552	Say if there is a book discriminating a race than I agree that it should be taken off the shelves	12
29938	4552	There are also people out there who are more leanent and others that are more strict	13
29939	4552	Just like parents for example	14
29940	4552	A lot of parents want to raise there kids in an envirenment where there is no swearing and violence, while other parents let there kids watch and listen to items out of there age group	15
29941	4552	Like with me my parents let me watch, read, and listen to what I want and in my opinion I turned out just fine, while others might not thing so	16
29942	4552	I have seen kids that had parents that weren't strict and let them indulge in these items and they turned out to be well behaved adults	17
29943	4552	Then there are also people you had strict parents and they turned out to be not so good of a person, and vise versa	18
29944	4552	That is about all I have to say on the topic	19
29945	4552	You have seen my views and what I believe	20
29946	4552	In a summary I guess I could say that everyone has there own opinions and views	21
29947	4553	Have you ever had a book, movie, or magazine offend you	0
29948	4553	Have you ever wished that no one else will ever have to read it	1
29949	4553	Should those offensive materials be removed from libraries	2
29950	4553	I don't think they should	3
29951	4553	The books, movies, and other materials should be marked saying that they @MONTH1 be found offensive	4
29952	4553	From my own experience I know how easily one can be offended by a book or movie	5
29953	4553	Many times I have read a book that has completely contradicted my religion	6
29954	4553	Most times I will ignore it and move on to a better book or movie	7
29955	4553	Sometimes it is harder to ignore	8
29956	4553	I always try to forget and move forward with my life, as others should do	9
29957	4553	Have you ever read the book The @CAPS1	10
29958	4553	If you have you are aware that there are some ideas in this book that bring up many controversies	11
29959	4553	One example from the book would be when they kill some of the children	12
29960	4553	Most people, like myself, do not agree with this idea	13
29961	4553	They think that it is wrong	14
29962	4553	Again some people @MONTH1 try to get this book banned, but it is still a wonderful literature	15
29963	4553	As you @MONTH1 have seen in the media lately, many people are trying to get the book @CAPS2 @CAPS3 removed from schools	16
29964	4553	Some people have found the book as offensive because it repeatedly refers to native americans by a more profound word	17
29965	4553	The law has not passed yet and has remained in schools	18
29966	4553	The law hasnt passed because it does not affect everyone	19
29967	4553	Some people @MONTH1 not find this offensive	20
29968	4553	Therefore it was not removed	21
29969	4553	Removing offensive books from libraries is the exact same thing	22
29970	4553	Some people @MONTH1 find the books offensive while others @MONTH1 not	23
29971	4553	Removing the books from everyone's reach would be appauling	24
29972	4553	The book @MONTH1 only be offensive to one race or religion	25
29973	4553	Why not simply put a warning label for that race or religion	26
29974	4553	That would take care of the problem by putting the decision of reading it and being offended in their hands	27
29975	4553	Possibly it isnt that the books are offensive to a race or religion, maybe it is to an age group	28
29976	4553	If that is the problem then the librarians can put those books in the appropriate age section	29
29977	4553	I have given reasons from my own experiences, other readings, and my obersavations in the media	30
29978	4553	I only hope that you consider my ideas	31
29979	4553	Do not remove the books from the shelf only because it is offensive to one person	32
29980	4553	Simply put a warning label on the book after a few complaints	33
29981	4553	This would put the responsibility of being offended in thier hands	34
29982	4553	Once again I do not think that offensive materials should be removed from our libraries only censored to the people of whom it is offensive	35
29983	4554	In @LOCATION1, everyone wants censorship	0
29984	4554	Mainly because they dont want be the outcast	1
29985	4554	Thats understandable in the case that we have numerous amount of different races in @LOCATION1	2
29986	4554	In some ways, censorship is necessary and in other ways, some people just want attention	3
29987	4554	If all different races want censorship, then why would we censor to the liking of just one group of people	4
29988	4554	Essentially, the censorship problem won't go away because it is a chain reaction	5
29989	4554	For example, if a group of people asked a library to get rid of books because of the references they make, that might be insulting to another group of people	6
29990	4554	then that group of people wouoldn't like a reference to another book, which another group of people dislike, and it goes on and on	7
29991	4554	So for the censorship towards different groups of people, there will have to be some tolerance	8
29992	4554	On the other hand, young children are in need of censorship	9
29993	4554	They grow and mature everyday, developing physically and mentally	10
29994	4554	So if we were to put an inapropriate book in front of them, they would read it and accept is as standard	11
29995	4554	And when they read bad things like that, they develop the wrong goals and values for their future lives	12
29996	4554	We are all different, and interpret things in different ways	13
29997	4554	So when you watch a movie to listen to music and think it wrong, someone right around the corner @MONTH1 think that its just normal	14
29998	4554	If you question someones movie or song, in the scheme of things, your questioning their judgement, and thats unfair to them	15
29999	4555	Books, music, movies, and magazines are all things people use for entertainment and study, something that everyone should have access too	0
30000	4555	If someone is offended by one of these things i do not think that they should be removed off shelves or advertisements	1
30001	4555	Many people will still find these books or other recources interesting	2
30002	4555	If the source is something more adult then it should be placed in a section that is labeled or supported by information that says so	3
30003	4555	Radio stations play songs that talk about sex, drugs and violence but i believe that kids need to be associated with these things	4
30004	4555	Parents can't keep their children from it all of there life, and most of the bad things said are cut out	5
30005	4555	Everyone has a different interest in the things that he or she likes	6
30006	4555	So why should you pull something off the shelf in stores or libraries just because its offensive to one person	7
30007	4556	I do not think libraries should have to censor the kinds of books, magazines, etc..., because people should have the right to read anything that want	0
30008	4556	People do not necessairly like reading some things, but if it is important that they research something, or read a book for school then they need to have the resources availablet to them	1
30009	4556	Take the book, @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2, for example	2
30010	4556	In that book it describes kidnapping, and the rape of young girls	3
30011	4556	Certain classes would require you to read this book, even though noone would really want to read about that	4
30012	4556	Some people have different tastes in movies	5
30013	4556	Personally, I prefer horror movies (but not gory) because they get me thinking about whats going to happen next	6
30014	4556	Some people like the really graphic and gory movies, and maybe if the libraries started taking movies like this off the shelf, it would be harder for those people to find them	7
30015	4556	Certain people would find some things more offensive than other people	8
30016	4556	Who can say where it should stop	9
30017	4556	Movies that make fun or talk about religion would be offensive to the people in that religion, but people from other religions would be un-effected by it	10
30018	4556	Just imagine watching @CAPS3 and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it	11
30019	4556	It would really offend people, while othre people couldn't care less	12
30020	4556	Basically, I think we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy, and if there is something out there that you do not want to see, you just have to ignore it and leave it alone	13
30021	4556	It should not be ruined for other people who would like to see it	14
30022	4557	Censorship in media has been around since the beginning of @ORGANIZATION1	0
30023	4557	Some of the first movies were seen as too offensive and never made it to the theatres, but books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries how do they even need to be censored	1
30024	4557	Censorship of books should be if a book is not for children keep them away from it	2
30025	4557	Books that are extremely offensive should be taken off the shelf or not put in a library	3
30026	4557	A library is a place of learning or reading for entertainment and those very offensive books do not teach learning or are entertaining	4
30027	4557	Music is another thing	5
30028	4557	Most songs out are highly offensive and should be in a different section	6
30029	4557	They should not be in the kid's area for music because do parents really want their children to learn cuss words at the age of five	7
30030	4557	Most parents do not want their children to learn cuss words and probably like if the libraries got rid of the music altogether that had to with sex, drugs, and cussing, all things that are censored in the media today	8
30031	4557	Maybe libraries can carry music that is censored instead of carrying music that is not censored	9
30032	4557	Movies are almost the same as music because it potrays mostly what music has in it, but it is visual	10
30033	4557	Again parents do not want to see drug use or inappropriate gestures that make the child copy what they see and hear	11
30034	4557	Libraries should put the movies in the adult section of the library	12
30035	4557	They should be censored by putting a censor bar over the mouth of someone who is cussing or put the bar over the person's hand or wherever when they are making an inappropriate gesture	13
30036	4557	Over the years it has become harder to censor magazines	14
30037	4557	Magazines are impossible to censor, unless you are the person receiving the magazine	15
30038	4557	If you are the libraries receiving the magazines grab a black marker and cross out words or pictures that seem to be offensive	16
30039	4557	The libraries should not carry the inappropriate magazines	17
30040	4557	If you are at a library and you see something inappropriate tell the librarian and see if they will censor the material in question.	18
30041	4558	Yes, I believe that certian materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
30042	4558	Some people do not want to read about those things that they have less intrest in	1
30043	4558	Materials like that can offend many people, so they should be removed from public shelves	2
30044	4558	For example, someone, by accident, @MONTH1 stumble upon a book containing inappropriate materials	3
30045	4558	They could take it home and begin reading it, and realize that the material that they are reading contains information that offends them	4
30046	4558	That really concerns some people and can hurt the library that held the book, and they could begin losing customers	5
30047	4558	Another reason why inappropriate materials should not be publicly displayed is, children	6
30048	4558	What if a young child was wondering around a store or a library, and randomly picked up a book or magazine with offensive pictures in it	7
30049	4558	That young child would see things that were not meant for that child to see	8
30050	4558	But, it does happen	9
30051	4558	Imagine how angry the parents of the child would be	10
30052	4558	They would most likely do everthing they could to get those materials removed from being displayed in public and from being within a child's reach	11
30053	4558	Children deffinately do not need to be seeing those things and also, even some adults do not even prefer it	12
30054	4558	Religion is also an example of why places should watch what they put on their shelves	13
30055	4558	It @MONTH1 be against some religions to read inappropriate materials	14
30056	4558	And with out them knowing their book contained it and they read it, they would be greatly offended and very upset	15
30057	4558	That could turn many people away from reading certain books, or even going to the store where they even purchased those materials	16
30058	4558	In conclusion, all of these are perfect examples of why inappropriate materials should be removed to prevent people from being offended	17
30059	4558	This is why materials such as books, magazines, etc	18
30060	4558	should be removed from public shelves, because they can offend many people	19
30061	4559	As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' As an author, she feels if she, and anyone else, has the right to take those uncensored books off the shelf, then there will be no books left	0
30062	4559	Depending on the person, some books @MONTH1 be offensive to some, but not all	1
30063	4559	I dont think that books should be able to be taken off the shelf by anyone because everyones preference on books can be different	2
30064	4559	I believe that libraries should keep unsensored books in a certain section, so children can easily be kept from seeing or reading unappropriote material at their age	3
30065	4559	And lastly, my own experience has led me to believe there should be a warning on certain books, saying not all the material could be appropriote	4
30066	4559	People having the right to take any book off the shelf would be unfair for the people	5
30067	4559	The library is a quiet place, meant for people to come and read any type of book, do homework, study groups, and undergo research for practiaclly any topic, @CAPS1 the number of books based on one persons opinion is unfair to everyone else who might enjoy that genre	6
30068	4559	Libraries and books were one of the main resources for researching before there was internet and many eople still prefer books to this day	7
30069	4559	I think the freedom of taking any book off the shelf would be endangering the process of learning and discovering     To reduce the number of uncensored books being found by children or people who find them offensive, there should be a certain section in the library for just those books	8
30070	4559	That way, people who have an interest in those books can read them, but also they are kept away for those who dont want to read them	9
30071	4559	I think taking away any type of book is unfair to the people because everyone like different genres of books, so having uncensored books in one section is fair to all	10
30072	4559	It would also be easier on parents knowing their children wont find books with material in them that they shouldnt be reading	11
30073	4559	By disagreeing with the right to take any book off the shelf, I think each book with any uncensored material should be marked with some type of sticker on the binding, just as a warning	12
30074	4559	If one sees that sticker and knows they dont want books with that type of material, then they can easily return the book with no argument	13
30075	4559	I have had experience with trying to find a book for a school project, but later finding there was material in it that really wasnt appropriote for school	14
30076	4559	This made me have to find a new book for the project	15
30077	4559	I didnt want to completely take the book off the shelf and away from any one else who wanted to read it, but a warning right then would of been easier in the situation	16
30078	4559	In conclusion, I dont believe that certain materials should be taken off by just anyone	17
30079	4559	Taking away books would spark many disagreements because even though one person might find something offensive, doesnt mean every other person will	18
30080	4559	As mentioned before, putting the uncensored books in a different section and putting a sticker on the binding would give a clear warning to anyone not wanting to read unsencored books	19
30081	4559	I think every library needs to take into consideration of the topics above to help people reduce the issue of people or children finding uncensored books in just any section	20
30082	4561	I believe if i worked at a library , if I found multiple idems that  has profanity, rasicm, slang.I agree with taking Magazines, @CAPS1, Music books, @CAPS2 books ,etc., I wouldnt want my own children going to the library and finding books with racism, etc.I would like to inspire more people to check out library books but you could'nt if there were inappropriate books 	0
30083	4561	If i worked at a library and I had to scan all the books to make sure the books were okay for young adults, young children to check out	1
30084	4561	How would it make you feel if I didnt do a book scan to check the books and one of your children brought home a inappropriate book how would you respond to it	2
30085	4561	I would do a observation on all the books that we had in our library	3
30086	4561	I also think that all libraries should have more inspireing books and cartooon , and baby books for little children	4
30087	4561	I think if majority of us all went to the library and we found a bad book I think we should have the right to remove it from the shelf, not only I would'nt want my children to see i woul'nt want someone elses children to see	5
30088	4561	This is how i feel if my child picked up a bad vulnerable book.I would'nt let he/or she go back to the library until they organized there library	6
30089	4561	Lastly I think librarys should have a big room full of little kids books	7
30090	4561	Also i think they should have different age groups like one room for baby books another room for @NUM1 to @NUM2 year olds and on up	8
30091	4561	I hope this inspires you .Always read the back of a book before checking it out of the library because you never know what the books going to be about	9
30092	4562	Censorship in libraries has been an issue among communities for as long as literature has been around	0
30093	4562	As expressed by Katherine Paterson, if one has the right to remove a book from the shelf that he or she deems unexceptable, then everyone has the right to remove books that he or she deem unexceptable	1
30094	4562	Everyone has an individual view of what is unexceptable, so that @MONTH1 leave no book to be left on the shelf	2
30095	4562	In saying this, if the government censors materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines, there is nothing to keep them from banning all that is there	3
30096	4562	There is bound to be someone that wants a certain thing to be censored, but the government @MONTH1 not see it a something to be censored	4
30097	4562	This brings up another question, what deems something unexceptable to be viewed	5
30098	4562	In my mind, this is a matter of opinion, so should we leave something like this in the government's hands to decide upon	6
30099	4562	I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should ever be censored	7
30100	4562	It is the choice of the individual to read, listen, or watch a certain material	8
30101	4562	The government's opinion of whether something should be censored or not has changed over time	9
30102	4562	The novel, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' was onced censored and banned by the government for it contained language and scenes that were viewed as inappropriate for readers	10
30103	4562	If this work were to remain banned, this canon of american culture, the effect that it had on american literature to this day would have been lost	11
30104	4562	I see literature as another form of art	12
30105	4562	Art should never be censored, for the lack of it will halt all developments in our society	13
30106	4562	Artists are ones to take risks and so are writers	14
30107	4562	If people were not allowed to take risks, what would become of our society	15
30108	4562	Developments that have been made by researchers, inventors, artists, and writers were once possibly deemed as risk	16
30109	4562	Should we have censored them	17
30110	4562	Another instance under which censorship had had a negative affect on society and culture was during the @CAPS2 regime	18
30111	4562	Music, books, art, movies, everything was censored or banned under @CAPS3's rule	19
30112	4562	A whole generation was lost under his power, for they were deemed enexceptable just because he did not like them	20
30113	4562	Now, should we put the power of picking what is unexceptable into the hands of one group of people	21
30114	4562	Whole generations of books, music, etc	22
30115	4562	could be at stake under such principles	23
30116	4562	There should be no reason that we are not allowed to see, read, or listen to whatever we would like to as a nation	24
30117	4562	The government, with the ability to censor libraries, can hinder our exposure to ideas unknown to us	25
30118	4562	Lack of exposure is the cause of a society's ignorance of the world around it	26
30119	4562	Who will stop the government from censoring what could be the next major masterpiece in literature	27
30120	4562	Nothing stopped them from banning 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1,' so is there limit	28
30121	4562	This is the question one has to ask themselves, to keep the government from potentially cutting the nation off from future masterpieces.	29
30122	4563	There has been a problem with censorship in libraries recently	0
30123	4563	Many books, movies, and music are being removed from libraries because they are found offensive	1
30124	4563	There are, however, libraries that do not remove items due to being offensive	2
30125	4563	There are many reasons as to why items are censored or not censored, but libraries should not have to censor certain items	3
30126	4563	One reason why offensive material should not be removed is because material that is considered offensive could be given a label that warns people of the material in the book or movie	4
30127	4563	If a child tries to check out a book or movie that has a warning label, they would have to have a parent with them to approve the item the child is getting	5
30128	4563	Whether or not children read or see the offensive material is the decision of the parents	6
30129	4563	Another reason offensive material should not be removed is because parents would have to approve the item that their child is getting	7
30130	4563	If they believe the material is too mature for their child, they could restrict them	8
30131	4563	If the item doesn't seem too harmful, they could allow it	9
30132	4563	That decision, however, is up to the parents	10
30133	4563	Books or movies that are considered offensive could also be given their own section of a library	11
30134	4563	Children would not be allowed in that section without parental supervision	12
30135	4563	And that, again, is the decision of the child's parents	13
30136	4563	There are many reasons why offensive material should not be banned	14
30137	4563	That sort of material, however, should have restrictions on who should and should not check them out.	15
30138	4564	Everyone has there own opinions and arguements about something	0
30139	4564	There are a lot of books that can be offensive to people in some ways	1
30140	4564	There can be over thousands of books in a library, and I find it difficult sometimes to find that right book that interests me	2
30141	4564	My personal opinion is that i do not think that books should be removed from a shelf even though it @MONTH1 offend someone	3
30142	4564	As I stated in the first paragraph, everyone has there own opinions	4
30143	4564	There are so many types of books out there from murderes, romance, mysteries, drugs, and many more	5
30144	4564	These books should be placed in seperate areas just as many books are	6
30145	4564	If books are taken off a shelf what does that mean to us people	7
30146	4564	Everyone has there own freedom	8
30147	4564	So if books are going to be moved from someone that's taking away from are individual freedom	9
30148	4564	There are more to books in a libray also	10
30149	4564	From books, movies, music, magazine, etc., can all of the have different types to them	11
30150	4564	I do think they should just be placed in different areas	12
30151	4564	I can see where people think that this can cause an influence to young children if they pick up something that is disturbing, but they should be with an adult	13
30152	4564	Adults know what is right from wrong than what children do	14
30153	4564	For example, whenever i walk into public places i hardly every see children just running around especially in libraries	15
30154	4564	Libraries are expected to be kept quiet and not out jumping around and screaming	16
30155	4564	The kids should be kept with there parent or an adult that way they can't grab something they shouldn't	17
30156	4564	I understand that some teenagers can be offended to drugs or killings, in magazines or books, but some people like reading about that kind of stuff	18
30157	4564	Does that mean we have the right to take it off the shelf because one is offended	19
30158	4564	To many think they have the right to do anything without negociating with others	20
30159	4564	People that do not like that kind of stuff should just put it back down and go on with what they were doing.I can understand if you think that restrictions should be put on some things because i will agree	21
30160	4564	There should be sections for teens, adults, and children	22
30161	4564	To me that does not mean we have to remove anything though from otheres for offending someone	23
30162	4564	Libraries can have an affect on your everyday life because of how calming and soothing it can be	24
30163	4564	You should be able to have freedom without removing anything from anyone	25
30164	4564	Taking away things does not mean your just taking away from one, it means your taking away from everyone	26
30165	4564	You can have your own censorship in libraries from your individual freedom	27
30166	4564	These are my personal views on why things should not be removed from shelves or anything else	28
30167	4565	There are lots and lots of arguments over the censorship of books and how they could affect children	0
30168	4565	Some people think that offensive books should be removed from library shelves	1
30169	4565	Others think that they should be left up there for the people who want to read them to do so	2
30170	4565	Some parents of children say that their child has became more offensive towards others, when others people think it is just bad parenting	3
30171	4565	So, you see that there are many different statements about offensive stuff being told to their children	4
30172	4565	I think that there are some offensive things that need to be kept on shelves and that there are some that shouldn't	5
30173	4565	Some articles that are offensive should be left up on shelves because they might teach children of what is bad and what isn't	6
30174	4565	Other articles that have no reason for being offensive should be taken off shelves	7
30175	4565	For an example there is music that talks about being extremely harsh and disobedient to others when that erson has done nothing harmful	8
30176	4565	One example of  being offensive in a good way is the book '@PERSON1.' @CAPS1 book showed how bad slavery was and how it should never happen again	9
30177	4565	If there is a book or any other piece of material that is offensive in a good way	10
30178	4565	I want to read it and understand what it is trying to portray to me	11
30179	4565	If it is portraying a bad image, then it should be removed from shelves	12
30180	4565	If it isn't portraying a bad image then I believe that it should be taught to children so they can understand the affects and know the difference between what is right and wrong	13
30181	4565	Books that suggest harmful behavior towards anything without a purpose should be thrown away	14
30182	4565	@CAPS1 is because children that read it could join in on what the book is suggesting	15
30183	4565	Then that could lead to bad consequeces for that person or someone else for that matter	16
30184	4565	I have witnessed accounts where someone has listened to bad music or read about something bad and then have been changed by it, nut not in a good way	17
30185	4565	There has been incidents where that person did something illegal and then had to face the harsh consequences for that action	18
30186	4565	Then I have also seen accounts where people have been changed in a good way because of a book	19
30187	4565	I personally have been chaged by the book '@ORGANIZATION1' in a good way	20
30188	4565	Now I realize how bad that was towards colored people, so I behave nicely to them	21
30189	4565	since the are just as equal to everyone else.	22
30190	4566	REMOVING BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFENSIVE IS A GOOD IDEA	0
30191	4566	I DO NOT AGREE BECAUSE, THE BOOKS SHOULD NOT BE GONE FOR GOOD	1
30192	4566	THERE SHOULD BE AGE LIMITS ON BOOKS	2
30193	4566	BOOKS THAT ARE OFFENSIVE SHOULD BE ONLY ALLOWED TO ADULTS OR A CERTAIN AGE GROUP, THIS WILL HELP WITH CHILDREN NOT BEING SCARED, TO HELP KEEP HISTORY AROUND AND, FREEDOM OF SPEECH	3
30194	4566	BY MAKING AS AGE LIMIT ON CERTAIN BOOKS, WE CAN KEEP CHILDREN INACENT AND PURE	4
30195	4566	WITH BOOKS SUCH AS '@DATE1', KIDS @NUM1 OR UNDER SHOULD NOT READ THAT BOOK	5
30196	4566	@NUM1 AND UNDER ARE STILL NIEVE	6
30197	4566	LITTLE KIDS DO NOT KNOW ABOUT SEX OR EVEN PRE-MARRITAL SEX	7
30198	4566	WITH @PERSON1 AND IS GIRLFRIEND HAVING SEX EVERY OTHER CHAPTER, ITS VERY INAPPORITE FOR A CHILD TO READ	8
30199	4566	ALSO, WITH ALL THE TORTURE PARTS, IT WOULD SCARE A LITTLE BOY/GIRL OUT OF HIS/HER MIND	9
30200	4566	WHEN GETTING RID OF OFFENSIVE BOOKS, WE REMOVE HISTORY	10
30201	4566	THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WOULD BE IF ANNE FRANK DID NOT WRITE HER DIARY	11
30202	4566	WE WOULD NOT KNOW HOW BAD HILTER REALLY WAS	12
30203	4566	WE COULD ONLY ASSUME	13
30204	4566	WITH GETTING RID OF BOOKS CAUSE THEY ARE 'OFFENSIVE' IS A RIDICULOUS REASON	14
30205	4566	BOOKS ARE ONLY OFFENSIVE TO SENATIVE PEOPLE	15
30206	4566	BOOKS KEEP HISTORY ALIVE	16
30207	4566	THINK: 'WHAT ARE WE WITHOUT HISTORY?'     FINALLY, FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS WHY THEY SHOULD SAY	17
30208	4566	AUTHORS HAVE THE RIGHT TO WRITE WHAT THEY WANT	18
30209	4566	IF THE READER DOES NOT LIKE IT AND FINDS IT OFFENSIVE, THEN THEY SHOULD NOT READ IT	19
30210	4566	IF SHAKE SPEARE, WAS TOLD HE COULD NOT WRITE HIS STORIES, WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE TRAGETY OF ROMEO AND JULIET	20
30211	4566	SO MANY BOOKS WOULD BE LOST IF SOMEONE COULD WRITE BECAUSE IT WAS OFFENSIVE	21
30212	4566	BOOK THAT ARE TOO OFFENSIVE  OR INAPORITE FOR A CHILD TO READ THERE SHOULD BE A AGE LIMIT ON IT	22
30213	4566	IF WE GET RID OF CERTAIN BOOKS WE GET RID OF CERTAIN HISTORY AS WELL	23
30214	4566	GETTING RID OF THOSE BOOKS TELLS A NEXT COMING AUTHOR THAT FREEDOM OF SPEECH DOES NOT MATTER TO OFFENCIVENESS	24
30215	4566	SO KEEP THE BOOKS AROUND, ITS ONLY WORDS	25
30216	4567	Many people claim that certain books should be allowed on @CAPS1 shelves	0
30217	4567	They claim that these books can be offensive to some and, therefore, should not be read	1
30218	4567	These books are known as '@CAPS2 Books.'  @CAPS3, librarians, and public officials have gone too far in thinking they should have the right to choose who reads certain books and who does not	2
30219	4567	In the novel To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5, the author uses many words and descriptions that people find are very offensive	3
30220	4567	These words, however, are essential to the setting of the novel	4
30221	4567	The author is not claiming that she personally feels that @CAPS6 @CAPS7 should be described in the way that they are, but a racist individual, such as @PERSON3 or many people during the time period, would not hesitate to describe them in such a way	5
30222	4567	The novel, To @CAPS4 a @CAPS9, is a great way for people to understand the history of the @CAPS10	6
30223	4567	Without the descriptions in the novels, a piece of history would unknown to many	7
30224	4567	The novel, @PERSON4 in the @CAPS11, attempts to delve into the life of a pubescent, whiney, teenager	8
30225	4567	The author, @PERSON2, uses many curses in the dialogue between characters	9
30226	4567	The charachters, however, are high school boys that live at a boarding school	10
30227	4567	To water down the language or to make the novel 'kid friendly' would make it impossible to describe the true nature of the characters	11
30228	4567	The novel also contains multiple references to sexual situations	12
30229	4567	These situations, although offensive to some, are necessary to show the progression of plot as well as the changing charachter traits of the protagonist, @PERSON1	13
30230	4567	Literature is not the only medium being targetted by those trying to completely censor libraries	14
30231	4567	Music, movies, magazines, and videogames are being targeted as well	15
30232	4567	In many cases, certain materials should not be viewed by young children or those who lack the maturity to handle them	16
30233	4567	It should be remembered that it is the @CAPS3 responsibility to censor materials for their children	17
30234	4567	Instances of violence, prejudice, and death are a diurnal occurence	18
30235	4567	@CAPS1 patrons should not be shielded from these occurrences	19
30236	4567	In conclusion, many times it is necessary for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many	20
30237	4567	Librarians should not be given control over which materials reach the shelves in libraries	21
30238	4567	Libraries should present a wide variety of books, movies, etc	22
30239	4567	to the public	23
30240	4567	If libraries do this, it becomes the responsiblity of either the @CAPS3 or the individual to pick out books that are within personal boundaries	24
30241	4568	Works of literature are works of literature no matter what they contain.All liteature should be placed on the shelves of a library	0
30242	4568	If for some reason the material is offensive or deemed as crude then it should go into a restricted section where permission is required to enter	1
30243	4568	Literature is a strong item when it comes to persuasion	2
30244	4568	So we must take care of what we allow to be released or seen and to which eyes	3
30245	4568	Literature is written by the author for many reasons	4
30246	4568	Perhaps the reason is to make money or to share a point of view but either way the author generally wants his or her literature to be read	5
30247	4568	How would the author ever achieve his or her goal if we decided to remove their hard work from the library shelves	6
30248	4568	It simply could not be read if it is not available	7
30249	4568	This is one reason why certain books should not be altogether removed from the library	8
30250	4568	No matter how crude a topic @MONTH1 be it @MONTH1 still be needed by certain individuals	9
30251	4568	If there were images of a nude person in a scientific book that librarians did not want children to get their hands on then how would students study a topic such as sexual education or anatomy for a class	10
30252	4568	Of course there are people who simply want to see nudity for foolish pleasure and that is why permission should berequired to obtain these books	11
30253	4568	A small closed off room in a library should be sufficient to contain all the books deemed crude	12
30254	4568	This way the only access to the books would be to get a key from a librarian	13
30255	4568	A book not read @MONTH1 as well never have been written	14
30256	4568	There is absolutely no point in destroying certain types of literature because some @MONTH1 feel offended	15
30257	4568	The simplest solution would be to simply make it so the only people to view these books would want or need to go view them	16
30258	4568	We simply can not lose certain pieces of writing because some parents do not trust their childs eye or because a person @MONTH1 be offended at the material	17
30259	4568	After all, when everybody has a chance to say what is offensive there will be no books left.	18
30260	4569	Everyone has their own opinion about certain things in life	0
30261	4569	Maybe its politics	1
30262	4569	it could be a sports team	2
30263	4569	Everyone has a right to their own opinion	3
30264	4569	As for reading materials, the opinions could be endless and even painful to hear	4
30265	4569	Opinions of some books and media type materials are biased	5
30266	4569	People could often be offended by the materials that can be accessed through a public library	6
30267	4569	For instance, let's say a grandmother and her grandchild are at the public library	7
30268	4569	The grandchild picks up a self-help book and starts to read	8
30269	4569	Later the grandmother reads it and finds out it says everything opposite of what the grandchild was taught about life by herself and her parents	9
30270	4569	To the grandmother, @CAPS1 is offensive	10
30271	4569	Through observation, I have noticed when a person picks up 'an offensive book' and reads a little of it, they tend to put it right back where they found it	11
30272	4569	It obviously isn't hard to do	12
30273	4569	So why should a book be taken out of a library when all you have to do is set it down and leave it	13
30274	4569	The same goes for music, movies, and magazines	14
30275	4569	If you don't like the music, don't listen to it	15
30276	4569	If you don't think it would be a 'nice' movie, don't go out and see it	16
30277	4569	If the magazine seems raunchy, don't buy it	17
30278	4569	@PERSON1 said it well, that if we took all the offensive books off the shelf '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 statement is as true as any statement could be	18
30279	4569	What would be left	19
30280	4569	Everyone has an opinion and likely someone will always find it offensive	20
30281	4569	Therefore offensive books and media should be allowed to stay on the shelves	21
30282	4569	Whether or not you find a book, movie, music, or magazine that is offensive, why fret over it	22
30283	4569	It's just easier to move on and forget it	23
30284	4569	Ignorance isn't all bad	24
30285	4571	When you go to library, you @MONTH1 have a lot choice about reading books, watching movies or listening music, and sometimes you might have offensive words or abusive langauge that is not appropriate for you children	0
30286	4571	Students must the right to remove the book from the library if he or she gets offended, or sometimes if there is a student who has came from a different @CAPS2 and they might get offeneded by the movies or music that are in the library	1
30287	4571	Books are most commonly used in the library	2
30288	4571	In those books, there are some book that are offensive to some student, and if one student find something offensive, he should have the right to remove the book from the library shelve	3
30289	4571	Many students like fiction books, which are true story but it might have some kind of offensive language or something that the student is feeling racist to him	4
30290	4571	School or any public library should remove books that contains inappropriate words that are not good for the kids to learn in their life	5
30291	4571	Music is also one of the important thing that is carried in any school library or any public library	6
30292	4571	Most common type of music that you can find in the library is @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 music	7
30293	4571	Most of the times those kinds of music might not carry and bad words, racistism or any offensive language, but some of the songs might carry something that is not apporpriate for school use	8
30294	4571	Those kinds of music must be remove from any school library or any public library	9
30295	4571	Movies are also carried in some library, but not every library carries a movie	10
30296	4571	Some of the movies might have blood scenes, abusive language, which might not be apporpriate for some childrens who are at school	11
30297	4571	You should check the rating of the movie that you are checking out of the library or if you are watching it at home or any other places	12
30298	4571	Movies might carry some kind of rasictism in them	13
30299	4571	Library is a good source for reading books, listening to music, or watching a movie	14
30300	4571	While you are reading a book or watching a movie, you might find words which might not be apporpriate for yourself or for students who read those books	15
30301	4571	These movies, books or music can carry abusive language or something that is rasict to some people who came from a different @CAPS2	16
30302	4571	Student should have the right to remove something that is not apporpriate in school use, such as, books, music and movies, if they contain something that is not suppose to be in it, you should remove it	17
30303	4573	I strongly disagree with the idea of removing any materials from public shelfs	0
30304	4573	Books,magazines, and the rest of the materials are based on the author's and musician's experiences and their observations	1
30305	4573	With the population of readers in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I no that the removal of books for what they might contain would have a bad impact on the people as a hole	2
30306	4573	The world needs its materials	3
30307	4573	The writer of the book writes on his Observations and his own personal experiences in life	4
30308	4573	The @CAPS3 put so much into it why take it away cause someone doesn't like how part of it's worded	5
30309	4573	Movies that are considered bad probably just have a bad word or a scene where theres a little blood	6
30310	4573	Lots of people like to make a big deal out of nothing	7
30311	4573	I seriously think some parents think if their kid here a bad work or sees a little podle of blood that the kid is going to end up in jail	8
30312	4573	Then there is music	9
30313	4573	The public thinks that kids should not be exposed to music like rap and hip-hop	10
30314	4573	I agree with that, but I also don't see if its christain rap or its a clean song whats wrong with it	11
30315	4573	A musician is not just payed for his or her amazing skills with an instrument, but also with his or her way to connect with the listener	12
30316	4573	I truely don't see any reason for take any form of materials off the shelfs	13
30317	4573	The artist who produces it has a right to their own oppion	14
30318	4573	The public I feel makes a big deal out of nothing	15
30319	4573	The smallest problems don't name the material the way the reader hears the work of the artist	16
30320	4574	Where it @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3     @CAPS4 up noone wanted to read, it's to hard or I don't want to	0
30321	4574	The best way to get out of reading was reading a magazine	1
30322	4574	Sure, it's educational but it also can demoralize some people's thoughts and feelings	2
30323	4574	One way to get rid of this problem is censorship, or taking a specific book out of the hands of the public	3
30324	4574	We all have poked fun at people, whether it is to hurt them or just give them a hard time, it can hurt people	4
30325	4574	Same way with the media	5
30326	4574	Books, magazines, @LOCATION1, and the internet all are competing for the success and money of its viewers, and the best wat to do that is to appeal to the audience	6
30327	4574	Give them what they want	7
30328	4574	For some reason everyone wants to demoralize people, and that is where I think it @CAPS1 the @CAPS3	8
30329	4574	Stand up for your rights and censor out those things that will lead to worse lives of those to come	9
30330	4574	Censorship @MONTH1 just be a big word to most people, but it carries a big problem	10
30331	4574	For me, it @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 whenever racism is a problem or else vulgarity is an obscene message	11
30332	4574	The music we listen to can get really intense	12
30333	4574	I'm a victim of the harsh music that we play more and more of today	13
30334	4574	Atleast the radio is trying to do better at this whenever they 'bleep' out the curse words or else persuade the artist to make clean lyrics that they play on air	14
30335	4574	That is where places are trying to clean things up	15
30336	4574	Make tomorrow be a better place than today	16
30337	4574	With all of these new @CAPS5 (Music @CAPS6) shows and other reality sitcoms making air on @CAPS6, it has opened the door to crudeness all over	17
30338	4574	They try to do a better job of cleaning it up in the sense of picture, censoring out body parts and on the worldwide coverage stations their mouths	18
30339	4574	Other stations like @CAPS5 don't do anything about the voices and the vulgarity people are showing and feeling towards each other	19
30340	4574	Books are another thing that could use some censorship	20
30341	4574	@CAPS2 teacher used to tell me, '@CAPS8, if you can't read it out loud to me, then you shouldn't probably be reading it.' and I agree	21
30342	4574	With the technology and all the other things, children are more vulnerable to these harsh words and actions	22
30343	4574	Thus, leading towards a society who can't trust anyone and easily turns to vulgarity when need be	23
30344	4574	With the world today, it is quiet easy to listen to the uncensored version that is shed from the radio	24
30345	4574	One person tries to make tomorrow a better place but the next tries to demoralize it	25
30346	4574	It's one thing if your angry and upset and are standing up for your rights but it's not whenever you do it for the fun of it	26
30347	4574	That is where it @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3	27
30348	4575	Censorship is a two sided question	0
30349	4575	There are people who believe that everything should be left the way that it is written	1
30350	4575	While other people believe that subjects that are offinisve should be removed	2
30351	4575	Is a subject too graphic for students	3
30352	4575	People have the freedom of speech	4
30353	4575	Knowledge is power	5
30354	4575	These are some reasons that can be thought about be for deciding if censoship is right or not	6
30355	4575	What is too offinsive for a student to read	7
30356	4575	In history many things are considered offensive	8
30357	4575	If all the books that talk about history are gone then how will students be able to learn about the past	9
30358	4575	If students can't learn about the past than the past is bound it repeat itself	10
30359	4575	Other books like horror books are for entertainment purposes, so what is wrong with someone reading a book on a murder if its just for entertainment	11
30360	4575	There are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities	12
30361	4575	If books are censored than that takes away a persons right to freedom of speech	13
30362	4575	That restricts somes creativity and since of wonder	14
30363	4575	If certain books are taken off the shelves of a library than books that are famous now @MONTH1 have never have been read	15
30364	4575	Books even if they are offensive can show someones thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world	16
30365	4575	People everywhere learn from books	17
30366	4575	Books about the past help people understand what to do different for the future	18
30367	4575	Many things are learned from books everyday and if certain books are taken down there will be things that will never be learned, bacuse someone thought that the book was not appropriate for a student to read	19
30368	4575	Students read books about the past so that they learn	20
30369	4575	The past is the best teacher and when the past is gone there is no way for those students to learn about the past	21
30370	4575	Having books that are said to be offinsive can help in @MONTH1 ways	22
30371	4575	All books should remain on the shelves	23
30372	4575	No matter what the book talks about a student can learn from that book	24
30373	4575	If the book is something that a student doesn't want to learn about than they don't  have to read the book	25
30374	4575	A lot can be learned from books and without books there can not and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come.	26
30375	4576	Libraries contain thousands and thousands of books and other materials	0
30376	4576	Within those books, magazines, and movies holds much knowlege, information in the non-fiction selection, and many entertaining and good morals in the fiction selection of books	1
30377	4576	If libraries began censoring their books, much information will be disclosed for no one in the public to read	2
30378	4576	The goverment could have multiple reasons as to why they feel certain books should be taken off the shelf	3
30379	4576	Some possible reasons could be they are racist, send the wrong message to children, or spread knowlege the @ORGANIZATION1 wants to keep away from the common man	4
30380	4576	Cencoring books would be a horrible idea and affect everyone	5
30381	4576	Some books that could easily be considered to be taken off the shelf would be books that are racist, or sugest radical ideas	6
30382	4576	Everyone in the world is deemed equal and books witch suggest one race, is better than another could offend the readers and for which the @ORGANIZATION1 decides to have it taken off the shelf	7
30383	4576	Books that suggest radical ideas could also belong in the group of books being taken off the shelf	8
30384	4576	The @ORGANIZATION1 could be worried that the reader @MONTH1 carry out this radical/terrorist idea and would in return censor them	9
30385	4576	But censoring these ideas would be denying the public their chance to learn, there are racists everywhere and just because you simply toss the book away, won't suddenly rid the world of racists	10
30386	4576	Another cause why books or magazines @MONTH1 be removed from the shelves could be that the send the wrong message to children or contain vulgar content	11
30387	4576	Parents try the best they can to repel the content away from their children, and books they begin to read wether it be on their own or in school could introduce kids of all ages to new content, their parents @MONTH1 not prefer them learning at their age	12
30388	4576	Parents @MONTH1 have a point, but children can not be protected from everything, they must learn and accept certain ideas as they grow and develop	13
30389	4576	Parents @MONTH1 be able to censor what their children read in their own home, but to take the books or movies entirely off the shelf would prevent the people, who enjoy or see comedy in these articles, movies, music, or books, to learn aquire knowledge, even if their only purpose of reading is just for laughs	14
30390	4576	Censoring @MONTH1 also be introduced into libraries because the @ORGANIZATION1 does not want the public learning and developing ideas on what they think the right idea of doing something is that the @ORGANIZATION1 disagrees with	15
30391	4576	They @MONTH1 think if people start learning and developing opinions from books they've read, they @MONTH1 start to oppose the @ORGANIZATION1, although people are always going to oppose the @ORGANIZATION1, not everyone will like what is going on, and to have a growing society and economy, knowledgable people are needed to invent develop concepts	16
30392	4576	In terms of race and religion, everyone is considered equal, but in terms of level of @CAPS1, everybody varies from one another	17
30393	4576	Which could be another reason to censor, so the public stays at the same level as their neighbors, so everyone is truely equal	18
30394	4576	Doing this would once again stop the modernization of the world, smart people would go unrecognized and the inventions that could have been stirring in their heads could turn to a blank thought, which is the same as everyone else's	19
30395	4576	In the book @CAPS2 @NUM1, Censorship is the main idea in this book	20
30396	4576	They censor the books so that everyone is truely equal, and even censor so that peoples looks and qualities all are equal to the others	21
30397	4576	This is not the way to go in @CAPS3 society	22
30398	4576	The @ORGANIZATION1 would have full control, and knowledge would not be blossoming in the schools	23
30399	4576	Even just a little bit of censoring in libraries, whether it be books, magazines, music, or movies, would put a damper in the knowledge and brain power of the society around	24
30400	4576	Censoing books is an awful idea that should never be put into place	25
30401	4576	The @ORGANIZATION1 should never be allowed to decide what the public views	26
30402	4576	It is in everyones own opinion and interest whether they themselves read or listen to the material provided.	27
30403	4577	There are many things out in the 'material' world that people take offense to	0
30404	4577	No matter what, there are always those people who have to be against whatever it is, whether it be a book or a song or a movie	1
30405	4577	But they do not have any idea what they are doing when they bring up their 'rights'	2
30406	4577	If they get to say that they are offended by the certain media product, not only do they announce that they have the right to try to have it banned, but they are giving the people who do not find offense in the material to dish out the same	3
30407	4577	If they can pull something off the shelves that they 'find offense to', then everyone @CAPS4 a right to	4
30408	4577	Another thing is that they claim to find offense to the song or book or movie, but if it bothers them that bad, they should just not listen/read/watch what @CAPS5 it is that they are feeling offends them	5
30409	4577	It would be that simple, just switch radio stations, or pick up another book, or watch a different movie	6
30410	4577	Another thing that the 'offended' people can try is having an open mind	7
30411	4577	It would make everything far less dramatic	8
30412	4577	People that say that they have offense to whatever the material @MONTH1 be usually use the phrase '@CAPS1 it's offensive and i don't want my kid to stumble across it.' They say that they have a right to take whatever the 'offensive material' is off the shelf and keep it from the public	9
30413	4577	They couldn't be more right and stupid at the same time	10
30414	4577	If they have a right to take a certain thing off the shelf, then @ORGANIZATION1 (the writer of the song/book/movie) can claim that he @CAPS4 been offended by some song/book/movie that the first person likes	11
30415	4577	Then it's just a free-for-all for everyone one to start taking everything off the shelves, one by one	12
30416	4577	Everyone @CAPS4 the same rights, and if the first offended person uses them to bring @ORGANIZATION1 down, then @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 the right to do the exact same thing	13
30417	4577	So the government shouldn't let things be taken off of shelves, because if they take one down, they might as @CAPS1 take everything else down with it	14
30418	4577	So, if some one finds offense to a song they hear on the radio, and they feel that strongly as to they want it removed from radios and anywhere that plays music, then they need help	15
30419	4577	When they find that song THAT offensive, then there is only one simple solution: turn the freaking radio to something else	16
30420	4577	Seriously, if someone finds the song offensive, then why are they going to sit there and listen to the entire song	17
30421	4577	Or if they find a book offensive	18
30422	4577	Would I sit and read an entire book if I don't like the content	19
30423	4577	Umm, no	20
30424	4577	If some one is that offended by whatever the material is, then they need to just do something else, because it's pretty rediculous to waste more time attempting to ban the song or the book that to just change the radio or find a different book	21
30425	4577	So if you're going to complain about the song or book being out there, just take your attention to something else, because every song, book, or movie out there @CAPS4 a right to be sold	22
30426	4577	On a light note, they could just have an open mind so that the song, or the book, or the movie can still be sold	23
30427	4577	They can try and read through the book to see if there is a reason that the author @CAPS4 written it this way	24
30428	4577	If they are conflicted by a movie, they should just watch it and test it to see if they really need to have it pulled off the shelf	25
30429	4577	Or if they are listening to the song, listen to it all the way through, or maybe even twice	26
30430	4577	The artist who sang the song might have been expressing themselves in a very deep way, and if someone pulls their song off the radio or where @CAPS5 it is played, then someone could be offending them in return	27
30431	4577	Having an open mind will let the so called 'offended person' see a whole other light being shown on why the 'offensive material' was even created	28
30432	4577	Then everything can stay ON the shelves	29
30433	4577	People have opinions, and that is one hundred percent okay	30
30434	4577	But sometimes people think that their opinions are the only opinions that matter	31
30435	4577	If some people get offended (or think they get offended) by something, they would try to removed whatever it was from the nations stores	32
30436	4577	But if they just sit back and think about it, then it would be okay	33
30437	4577	If they have a right to remove anything from the shelves, so does everyone	34
30438	4577	If that @CAPS2 @CAPS3 song really, really offends they, they should just change the radio station and forget about it	35
30439	4577	And if they have open minds as to why the things are still 'out there', then all the songs, and all the books, and all the movies will still be on the shelves for people to buy	36
30440	4577	I do not approve of removing anything from stores just because one person feels like if they don't like it, then it absolutly @CAPS4 to go	37
30441	4577	No, they world doesn't just revolve around one person, and it never, @CAPS5 will.	38
30442	4578	Controversy in the @CAPS1          @CAPS2 someone walks in to there public @CAPS1 they are overwelmed with books	0
30443	4578	Even though one person could never read that many books, the @CAPS1 has to have a wide selection, for the people that read different thing	1
30444	4578	The @CAPS1 should not get rid of books that offened some people	2
30445	4578	the @CAPS1 is a public place that allows people to read what they want	3
30446	4578	If someone dose not agree to what another person is reading they don have to be there	4
30447	4578	Since the @CAPS1 is a public place, and people can not just throw away a book because that is offensive	5
30448	4578	Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If everyone would throw away books that were offensive, there would be no books left	6
30449	4578	This would cause a lot of people to stop reading and learning	7
30450	4578	The public @CAPS1 is open for anybody to read a book	8
30451	4578	Keeping this in mind the @CAPS1 has to have books that appeal to everyone	9
30452	4578	If they would only have one type of book, not many people would want go the the @CAPS1	10
30453	4578	the @CAPS1 has to offened some people to please others	11
30454	4578	People who go the @CAPS1 go because it is there choise to go and get a book	12
30455	4578	If people find the books in the @CAPS1 offensive, they do not have to go	13
30456	4578	Books that people find offensive are on the shelf for others who want to read them	14
30457	4578	If someone finds a book offensive they dont have to read it	15
30458	4578	Librarys should have as many books as they can, so they can appeal to every taste	16
30459	4578	They should not get rid of books that offened a small group of people	17
30460	4578	Those people do not have to read books that they find offensive	18
30461	4578	Librarys are a public place for anybody to read what they want.	19
30462	4579	Personally I believe that items that are found offensive should be left on the book shelves	0
30463	4579	People that find them offensive don't have to read them they can just ignore them and move on with their life	1
30464	4579	Students @MONTH1 need to use that certain information in a classroom	2
30465	4579	If libraries take the information out of the library the students will not be able to find the info needed for their project or paper	3
30466	4579	Students will eventually learn all about these offensive magazines, movies, music, and books someday in their lifetime	4
30467	4579	If offensive books are taken down where else will they go, they are still going to be offensive somewhere else	5
30468	4579	Libraries who have offensive books are not trying to offend anyone in anyway, they are on the shelves for the education of the reader or viewer	6
30469	4579	If movies are that offensive, don't rent them and save yourself and the libraries time	7
30470	4579	People get offended by all of these readings from a certain library, if the library chooses not to take the books off the shelves then go to a different library	8
30471	4579	Also the internet will more than likely have all of the information that is just as offensive	9
30472	4579	Internet is a virtual library, you can search videos, books, magazines, and music	10
30473	4579	If people think they are getting rid of the offensive books, magazines, etc	11
30474	4579	They are wrong because the internet will hold that information for as long as it needs to	12
30475	4579	Library censorship is a pointless act due to the information provided on the internet	13
30476	4579	Libraries should be able to choose the books and information that they have in their building	14
30477	4579	As long as those books, music, magazines, movies, etc, are put in the right section	15
30478	4579	The movies that parents don't want their children to see @MONTH1 be placed in the wrong section of the library	16
30479	4579	In that point of view you could see why parents are getting upset about inappropriate items on the shelves	17
30480	4579	The books should be divided so that children have their own section of the library and adults have their own section as well	18
30481	4579	Most of these offensive items are not placed in libraries because of this problem with people being offended	19
30482	4579	Movies that are that offensive should probably be in a movie store that states that the movies are offensive and could be inappropriate	20
30483	4579	Maybe people over react to the situation and don't realize that the movie, book, etc, are not offensive enough to make an argument over it	21
30484	4579	I personally have never been to a library and saw a book, magazine, movie, song that was offensive to me or my family	22
30485	4579	What does an offensive book look like	23
30486	4579	More than likely it has something to do with someone's religion, ethnicity, etc	24
30487	4579	Items are only offensive to certain people	25
30488	4579	If you or someone you know that is offended greatly by a book, song, magazine, or movie in a specific library don't go back or tell the person you know as well	26
30489	4579	In conclusion if a book, movie, etc, is that offensive in a library near by, avoid that library and don't worry about going back	27
30490	4579	Offensive material could also be learning material	28
30491	4581	@CAPS2, I do believe that book, music, mvies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are taken offensive	0
30492	4581	Poeple should not be putting stuff out there if they are making others feel not happy about what they do	1
30493	4581	Althought, we might think that putting stuff in papers and on movies, don't hurt people	2
30494	4581	Well guess what they do     @CAPS1 of all, movies that have stuff to deal with sexual relationships	3
30495	4581	For example, gender marrage, they say that people should not marry the same sex	4
30496	4581	They make fun of them because they are not like others and they can take that very offensive	5
30497	4581	Very little people like being with the same sex	6
30498	4581	By us putting them in book, on movies, or making song to make them feel offensive is not the best way to go	7
30499	4581	Another one is about special needs, movie or book that have to deal with people putting down others that have special problems	8
30500	4581	Although, they don't show that thier sad it don't mean that we didn't offened them in a way	9
30501	4581	Families that have a special needs child, sister, brother, mom or dad don't like it very much when someone outs something out there about their problem that they @MONTH1 have	10
30502	4581	Also, they will feel really upset and sometimes can get mad for that	11
30503	4581	Most importantly, books or movies making fun of people that don't have a lot of stuff	12
30504	4581	It's not their fault that they don't have the money to buy stuff like others	13
30505	4581	For example, a nice house or nice clothes, most families have problems trying to pay rent and do other bills if only one parent is working	14
30506	4581	A lot of parents that work are gettin laid off are not even gettin paid for it	15
30507	4581	Worst of all, a famliy member (like someone who lives in the house) @MONTH1 have to go to the hospital and whe you go to the hopstial you have to pay for the bills	16
30508	4581	Some families are in and out of the hospital year after year and they don't have the money to pay for new stuff for the house or the people who live in it	17
30509	4581	In conclusion, @CAPS2	18
30510	4581	i do believe that they shoukd take certain books, movies, mafazines, ect., off the shelves because they can be taken offensive	19
30511	4581	We don't know how rude it is to have something out there that makes fun of someone in a way until it's to late	20
30512	4581	Many people really don't like it when they see something out there thats offensive to them	21
30513	4581	They don't know how to react about it and they get frustrated	22
30514	4582	Books are to be read not taken off beacuse of what they say	0
30515	4582	That to me is stupid are childern live in world of war and fear everyday what is a damn book gonna change	1
30516	4582	Nothing there gonna hear the f word and see blood and gore	2
30517	4582	Would you rarther them see it for the first time in real life and not know what to do	3
30518	4582	Music is one thing that can bring everybody together	4
30519	4582	So by are childern not being able to hear some of them lyrics then we are pushing them into being pussys	5
30520	4582	Maybe there just some real people teelling the truth that you dont want your kid to hear	6
30521	4582	Movies are something that people love to watch come on we pay @MONEY1 to get onto see them sometimes	7
30522	4582	Are kids are gonna be better because there parnets didnt want them to see the new horror movie there gonna see in real life one day why not now	8
30523	4582	Parnets your not doing us a favor by not letting us see the real world YOUR @CAPS1 US @CAPS2 because when we get into that sitituation in real life we arent gonna know what to do then were scewed.	9
30524	4583	Nobody should believe that we have the choice to take books off the shelves of a library	0
30525	4583	America is a free country and we can write whatever we want	1
30526	4583	Everyone has freedom of speach, your just taking that admendment and putting it into music, books, or a movie	2
30527	4583	When you are looking for a book and you find one that seems offensive just put it back on the shelf and move on	3
30528	4583	Everyone have seen a lot of things that are offensive to races and beliefs	4
30529	4583	You hear jokes that are offensive but that is all that it is a joke and it is not to be taken seriously	5
30530	4583	I have read a book recently called '@CAPS1's your @CAPS2' it was not what I thought it would be, so I just put it down and picked up a different book and kept on reading	6
30531	4583	If everybody were able to take books out of a library just because it was offensive would we have any books at all	7
30532	4583	Movies have a protection against this called ratings	8
30533	4583	The ratings are from '@CAPS3 to @CAPS4.' If the movie you watch is more towards the @CAPS4 section then it will have more offensive language and violent scenes	9
30534	4583	That is why there is always a blocked off section at a dvd rental store	10
30535	4583	That section is only for mature people of the ages @NUM1 or older	11
30536	4583	If by any chance your kid strays in there and finds somthing not suited for him and you really get fired up just think @CAPS1 let him wonder into that section	12
30537	4583	@CAPS1 should be watching him at all times, @CAPS1 is responsible for him	13
30538	4583	I do not agree that reading material or anything in that matter should be taken off of a shelf	14
30539	4583	Thats like saying if someone did not like how the @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 was worded they could just take it down and throw it away	15
30540	4583	We would have nothing to read	16
30541	4583	So the next time you see something that is offensive just put it back and move on	17
30542	4584	Censorship in libraries has gotten to strict making the next generation miss key lessons learned about life	0
30543	4584	How would you feel if you went to the library and as an adult would only be able to check out childrens books, magazines, and music	1
30544	4584	Now i know thats a little extreme but in all seriousness what are we without knowledge	2
30545	4584	Where would we be if there was no books, magazines, or music left	3
30546	4584	No libraries means no knowledge, no books, no life lessons, no imagination, and above all no excitement	4
30547	4584	we would de-evolve back into our animal-like state, because in all actuality we humans have only one thing that has given us the power to become so advanced and smart, our brains	5
30548	4584	There was once a quote by which i live my life by, it went like this 'if knowledge is power then books must be the means of getting that power'	6
30549	4584	From my own knowledge and views of the world i will give you my argument on censorships and how they effect libraries	7
30550	4584	Censorship, what do we all think of when we as americans say censorship	8
30551	4584	I think of  bad thing like cuss words,nudity, and battle scenes	9
30552	4584	The thing about these is they are displayed in different ways such as music	10
30553	4584	an example of music not being censored would be rap	11
30554	4584	go ahead get the explicit version of that rap song or sometimes it might already be bad enough	12
30555	4584	I personnely don't like rap so this opinion is biased, I more like a rock and metal music	13
30556	4584	people like music and it takes away from our freedom, if you don't like what they are saying just don't listen to it	14
30557	4584	Another subject of intrest when we talk about censorship issues is magazines	15
30558	4584	We all at some point have seen or learned of naughty magazines like playboy	16
30559	4584	Now im all for making sure those type of magazines stay out of school libraries, but public libraries should have their own adult sections were we might not put playboys but stuff like hunting magazines,or hot rod magazines line the adult sections shelves	17
30560	4584	The last thing that is subjected to rather extreme censorship is books	18
30561	4584	Lets be honest we all had a favorite book when we were little or as we grew up	19
30562	4584	One such book that is an absolute classic is 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' its currently being removed because it has like one or two cuss words in it	20
30563	4584	I mean really people its a great book but at the first sign of a cuss word everbody starts shouting burn it	21
30564	4584	Now many of the following generations will never get to read that classic because people took it out of libraries	22
30565	4584	i feel that people should learn to relax andnot fret over one or two cuss words because that is apparenly all it takes to ruin a great book	23
30566	4584	So whats my final conclusion	24
30567	4584	when does our first amendment right to free speech with censorship and too much censorship meet	25
30568	4584	Apparently in libraries where one can't read @ORGANIZATION1, wood craftmanship, or listen to music that involves cuss words	26
30569	4584	In my personnel opinion i think that adults should have their own section uncensored, teens should have only censorship on things like nudity, and children well they are just right on this subject no more censorship is needed	27
30570	4584	So i ask you, the one who grades my essay to just stop and think with an open mind how long do you hide your children or your grandchildren form the real world	28
30571	4584	In the real world these things are deamed acceptable if they weren't exceptable they wouldn't be out there to begin with	29
30572	4584	Truly if you decide to take out classics like @PERSON1 we lose not only knowledge and the story we lose our freedom	30
30573	4585	Yes, some materials,such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive.Yet they shouldn't be removed from shelves.Reason number one is: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't	0
30574	4585	Reason number two is:'offensive' material will @CAPS6 be out in the world.And finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world	1
30575	4585	In @CAPS2 following essay, I will explain thoroughly my reasons for an opinion as such	2
30576	4585	'@CAPS1 is one man's trash is another man's treasure.' @CAPS2 quote goes very well with the first reason: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't	3
30577	4585	People's views about everything could be significantly different	4
30578	4585	For example, a book about @PERSON1 killing the @CAPS3 could be offensive to someone with @CAPS4 descent, meanwhile,a book filled with cursing could be offensive to a religous person	5
30579	4585	As you can see,'offensive' is defined differently by different people	6
30580	4585	Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world	7
30581	4585	Parents can't shelter their child from these things forever	8
30582	4585	At one point in their lives, children will learn offensive things and parents won't be able to do anything about that	9
30583	4585	Children have actives mind that pick up on everything around them	10
30584	4585	If they learn from these offensive materials, then parents should teach them @CAPS1 is wrong and @CAPS1 is right	11
30585	4585	Finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world	12
30586	4585	@CAPS2 reason ties in perfectly with the first	13
30587	4585	Parents can't decide @CAPS1 the parents of other children should do	14
30588	4585	They can only do something about @CAPS1 their children are doing	15
30589	4585	Therefore, my belief on censorship in libraries is nonexistant for the following reasons	16
30590	4585	@NUM1.)@CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't	17
30591	4585	@NUM2.)Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world	18
30592	4585	And @NUM3.)If parents don't want their children reading offensive material,they should only ban their own children from reading them and not the rest of the world	19
30593	4585	Thus, there should be no censorship in libraries	20
30594	4586	Should we censor the materials in libraries	0
30595	4586	Some people believe that some of the books, magazines, and music in libraries are too vulgar and obscene	1
30596	4586	This could be a major problem if people are allowed to say what is too obscene to be put in a library	2
30597	4586	Katherine Paterson makes a great point by saying that if everyone was allowed to take books, magazines, and music that they find inappropriate off the shelves, there would be nothing left for us	3
30598	4586	Books have been around for centuries	4
30599	4586	They are passed on, shared, and enjoyed by people all over the world	5
30600	4586	Books contain important information, stories, and tales of people's past times	6
30601	4586	Therefore, I do not believe that certain books should be banned from libraries	7
30602	4586	By taking away books in libraries, you are taking away the author's freedom of speech	8
30603	4586	Also, technology is rapidly advancing, and sometime in the future, I think libraries will become extinct	9
30604	4586	With all of the new devices we have @DATE1, people can just get their books online	10
30605	4586	Magazines are a great tool to advertise and talk about some major topics happening around the world	11
30606	4586	Magazines are a great thing to read when you want to catch up on news, sports, or just other miscellanious topics	12
30607	4586	With that said, magazines can also be bad for public libraries due to some of the explicit content	13
30608	4586	This is a reason on why some people would want to get rid of magazines from libraries, but I don't think they should be banned	14
30609	4586	By getting rid of magazines, you take away company's freedom of press, which is a major issue	15
30610	4586	Refering to the previous paragraph, technology is growing, and it is very easy to just go and look at news, sports, and other topics on the @CAPS1	16
30611	4586	That is why I do not think magazines should be taken out of libraries	17
30612	4586	My final discussion is music	18
30613	4586	Music has also been around for many centuries and it has done many things	19
30614	4586	Music is something everyone can relate to	20
30615	4586	No matter who you are, you probably have some favorite band, music artist, or genre of music that you prefer	21
30616	4586	By saying this, I do not think music should be taken out of libraries either	22
30617	4586	Taking away music is like taking away humans natural culture	23
30618	4586	We all enjoy it, but have different versions that we enjoy	24
30619	4586	Therefore, I do not think it would be wise to take away music from libraries	25
30620	4586	In conclusion, libraries are nothing without all the history, stories, news, and music that is inside of it	26
30621	4586	Censoring the libraries would not be a good idea and it would most likely upset many people	27
30622	4586	It is true that with technology that libraries @MONTH1 eventually become extinct	28
30623	4586	Until that happens, I hope they do not censor their materials.	29
30624	4588	Most movies, magazines, music, and books are considered offensive to at least one person in this world	0
30625	4588	These materials often fall victim to censorship and are challenged daily to be banned, especially books	1
30626	4588	Mothers and fathers do have the right to prohibit such materials, but they do not have the right to ban them from all the world's children	2
30627	4588	Whatever the reasoning should be censorship is wrong	3
30628	4588	It restricts the @ORGANIZATION1 of the writer, the @ORGANIZATION1 of the reader, and, as Katherine Paterson well put it, would result in 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     @CAPS1 to the @ORGANIZATION1 everyone has the freedom of speech and the freedom of press	4
30629	4588	This does not exempt writers or artist who occasionally, or more than occasionally, include explicit content in their works	5
30630	4588	In every book there a message the writer is tyring to tell his or her audience	6
30631	4588	How they go about getting that message across is their own business, and they have all @ORGANIZATION1 to do so in anyway they @MONTH1 wish	7
30632	4588	People who wish not to see the writer's message have the right not to	8
30633	4588	But when they fear the message and try to stop anyone else from seeing or hearing it, then they are violating the @ORGANIZATION1 of the writer by telling them they cannot include the offensive material	9
30634	4588	Most writer's include this material for a reason	10
30635	4588	For example, swear words, such as the ones argued in @PERSON2, often times show the characters' traits and also improve the setting	11
30636	4588	During those times, people did call @CAPS2 @CAPS3 by explicit names, even those who were in no way prejudice	12
30637	4588	That was the way of life for them and the author was simply trying to show that to the reader	13
30638	4588	By censoring the word from text, people were, in a way, covering up the history of the @CAPS4 @CAPS5	14
30639	4588	Every person over the age of eighteen has the right to read anything they wish	15
30640	4588	They are no longer under the commands of their legal gaurdians and in no way are under the command of other children's parents	16
30641	4588	Parents who prefer their own children not to see or listen to certain materials have the right to censor the materials away from their children	17
30642	4588	On the other hand, they have no right to tell their neighbors what and what not their children can see	18
30643	4588	Every parent has different rules and guidelines for their children, and this is their right	19
30644	4588	They @MONTH1 believe that it is important for their children to be exposed to these certain materials early on in life so that they can learn right from wrong from the very start	20
30645	4588	It is possible that they even might not care	21
30646	4588	Whatever the cause @MONTH1 be they have the right to expose their children to anything they see appropriate	22
30647	4588	For example, @PERSON3 is an author who has been challenged throughout her entire career	23
30648	4588	Many of her books include the topic of menstration, which many parents found inappropriate for their grade school children to read	24
30649	4588	Therefore, those parents brought the books to the attention of the school board, who quickly removed the books from its library shelves	25
30650	4588	Many parents, librarians, and teachers were upset by this and argued that the topic was not at all harmful	26
30651	4588	In fourth grade girls are required to watch a video on the topic of puberty and in fifth grade many girls begin to go through these changes themselves	27
30652	4588	So how is it inappropriate for them to read fictional books that include the topic	28
30653	4588	Many parents believe it is not and even encouraged their children to read the books, but the other parents who found it offensive reuined these parents' children's right to read	29
30654	4588	Therefore, in the long-run, censorship is wrong	30
30655	4588	It restrict the @ORGANIZATION1 of the audience and of the writer, which prevents growing experiences for both	31
30656	4588	If everyone was to ban one book they found offensive, the world  would be without any books and become quite dull	32
30657	4588	No one would be able to read and no one would be able to express themselves freely.	33
30658	4589	The library is a very sourceful place but there are just some things that should not be displayed or made veiwable to the public	0
30659	4589	Some topics or other things found in the library are not suitable for every one and should not be allowed in a public place	1
30660	4589	First, there should be a censorship on what you can and can not get or look up at a library	2
30661	4589	What if some one looks up or check out something that should not be seen by others and it ends up in the wrong hands of someone	3
30662	4589	That person then could end up using the information for the worst	4
30663	4589	Everything that's in the library is not appropriate for all ages	5
30664	4589	Next, there is a lot of offensive things you can find in the library	6
30665	4589	So things should be censored so one one ends up gettin hurt	7
30666	4589	The librarian or any one whos in there @MONTH1 never know what someone looked up or is planning until after it @MONTH1 happen or a problem is started	8
30667	4589	Therefore blocks should be put up for things that maybe be harmfull to others	9
30668	4589	Finally, although people @MONTH1 feel it's no one eleses business what they research or check out, they should think, it is open to the public and anyone could easily see or go back to what they were looking at	10
30669	4589	Its not fair to be in a public place and get hurt by the offensiveness of some one	11
30670	4589	People have to think the library is open to children and elderly	12
30671	4589	In conclusion, there should be a censorship on what you can find in the library	13
30672	4589	There is hurtful and inappropriate things that should absolutly not be allowed	14
30673	4589	Most important a library is a place that you should not get offended in by what some one looks up, checks out or even says.	15
30674	4591	All of the materials in a library shold have to be check out of the library before anyone can take them out of the library	0
30675	4591	Which the librarian should make sure that anything that goes out of the library should have to be checked out before a student can take the materials out of the library	1
30676	4591	the topics that are going to be talked about are: why materials have to be checked out of the library, what happens if you do not check out the materials, and what happens if you lose the materials that you check out of the library	2
30677	4591	Materials that the library has is for everyone to check out if they want to check anything out of the library	3
30678	4591	So, then the librarian will be able to tell a student if they want a book, music, movie, magazine, ect., the librarian can tell the student if the material is in or is checked out of the library	4
30679	4591	Then, the student will be able to check out the material or can ask the librarian to hold the material when it comes back in for the student	5
30680	4591	Then, the whole school can be running smoothly senice the librarian can keep track of the materials that is in the library	6
30681	4591	If you do not check out the materials that lis in the library nobody will be able to see where the materials are at	7
30682	4591	Which, if you checked out materials out of the library the librarian can track it down for you	8
30683	4591	So, if you do not check it out the librarian will not be able to track down any of the material that is in the library	9
30684	4591	So, then the librarian can not tell a student where the materials are at and then the materials is out of the library and noone can check it out	10
30685	4591	Then, the librarian has to wait til the person that took the materials out of the library brings the materials back to the library so that it will be able to be check out by the person that wanted it when it was out of the library	11
30686	4591	If you check something out of the library and you lose it you will have to pay for it	12
30687	4591	When you lose something from the library, that means that noone will be able to check it out until it eithers gets returned or you have to pay the librarian the money for a new one	13
30688	4591	Then the next person that wanted it will have to wait even longer to get the lmaterials because you lost the libraries copy of the materials that you check out	14
30689	4591	Then the librarian will have to make sure that the next person that wanted the materials will be able to get it when ever it came back in the library	15
30690	4591	Then, the person that lost the material should not be able to check anything out of the library anymore thay can only sit in the library to reas the materials that they either want to read or have to read for a project for a grade for one of their classes	16
30691	4591	Also, if you do not check the materials out of the library, and you lose it the the librarian will not be able to track down the materials for anyon that wants it so the check it out	17
30692	4591	These are just some of the many reasons why you have to check out materials from the library	18
30693	4591	There is alot more reasons you hve to check out materials from the library	19
30694	4591	So, then the librarian will be able to keep up with all of the materials that is in the library, and any person can check out any material that they either want or need for a class and it does not have to stay in the library when ever you want it	20
30695	4592	If there was a book on a shelf that I found offensive, I would want it removed, but then again I wouldn't	0
30696	4592	Every one has there own opinions and there own view on things	1
30697	4592	Mine are different from every one elses'	2
30698	4592	I mean I @MONTH1 find it offensive, but how is everyone else going to see if it is or not, if you take it off the shelf	3
30699	4592	Everyone is entitled to their own opinion	4
30700	4592	What we do, believe in, or think is what makes us ourselves	5
30701	4592	Just because one person finds a book, music, or some movies offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will	6
30702	4592	Others might happen to like it even if you don't	7
30703	4592	Taking something away just because you think it is offensive, is like taking a little part of some one away	8
30704	4592	It's like the school making kids wear uniforms, it takes our individuality away	9
30705	4592	We all have to have some way to express ourselves and maybe the thing you find offensive, expresses some one else in some way	10
30706	4592	There is going to be a lot of things in life that people don't like, but can you really just get rid of it all	11
30707	4592	It does not work like that	12
30708	4592	You are not always going to have your way in life, but it's life and there is nothing you can do about it	13
30709	4592	Just because you don't like something or you find something offensive, doesn't mean you can just remove it or replace it	14
30710	4592	Life just goes as planned and there will be things that you don't like, but you can't change that	15
30711	4592	It is life and replacing or removing things won't make things easier	16
30712	4592	So if I found something offensive, I'd just ignore it and leave it there because is taking it off the shelve really going to help?	17
30713	4593	Yes I believe certain material should be removed from the shleves at a library if they are offensive	0
30714	4593	because people dont want or like to go to any public library that is open to anyone, let them come in and @CAPS1 some book or etc offensive to that person	1
30715	4593	Like a child grabbed some bad unapropriate book and his mommy found him reading it so she wasnt to happy and left	2
30716	4593	t @CAPS1 that could be offensive to anyone particular	3
30717	4593	Their are certain books, magaizines, etc that dont need to be in the library	4
30718	4593	Becasue the public doesnt need to @CAPS1 stuff like that in a public library	5
30719	4593	By the way someone that could think that certain book in offensive could report that certain book or etc if it is offensive to someone that is irregular at that certain public library	6
30720	4593	So watch what you bring or put in a public library it has to apropriate to where all the publics that walk in to any nice library	7
30721	4593	Being offensive, is not a good thing because you want to be able to walk in a nice public library and be relaxed not startled by any none reasonable book or magazines or etc that should be there	8
30722	4593	Music is a big problem with people being offensive about it because theres so many unaproperiate, bad language music around here that they have to watch what they put in the library ecspecially for the little kids, seniors too	9
30723	4593	Books are material that should be fun or interesting to read for people, not for people to look at or find on he shelves a offensive book or magazine because thats not what the library is for, its for going there relaxing and finding a book or etc to have and be good with, or checked out to use somewhere else	10
30724	4595	I believe that they should leave leave them on the shelves	0
30725	4595	I think people take stuff like that to serious, if they dont like it I think they should just leave it alone.What some people might find offensive others will find interesting	1
30726	4595	There is alot of stuff out there that might be a little offensive to some people, but if they dont like it all they have to do is put it up and go on with there life like its no big deal	2
30727	4595	In the past there has been some movies that make fun of people for the way they act or just something they did in the past	3
30728	4595	Stuff like that I can understand because that can be personal reasons	4
30729	4595	There has also been times when I have seen people make a big deal over nothing.Sometimes people say stuff and the person reading it can take it a whole different way.There is still alot of people taking books off the shelf because of someone complains about the language in it or maybe making fun of another race	5
30730	4595	I think the worst thing today is magazines because they are always judging people about who they are with, what they did @TIME1, or even who has the best body and who has the worse body.I think people should just stop worrying about everybody else so much and just worry about theirself and we wouldnt have so many problems.	6
30731	4596	Diffrent books are mean't for diffrent people	0
30732	4596	Yes, somtimes it matters when certain materials are not supose to be showing in public	1
30733	4596	But, we need to know whats happening all over the world	2
30734	4596	Even as we speak there might be a battle going on somewhere or somthing very importent is about to happen in other contrey	3
30735	4596	We will need this informaion all the time	4
30736	4596	There's this old saying that I read in a book once, 'You can not juge a man until you claim under his skin and walk around in it'	5
30737	4596	It took me awhile to understand what they mean't by that	6
30738	4596	Then, I finely understood what they really mean't	7
30739	4596	You can't juge someone by their outer looks, you must juge their inner personaltiy.When you look at a book, movie, magazines, etc., you can not juge it until you see it for yourself	8
30740	4596	Compony people create these things for certain people that enjoy the things they love	9
30741	4596	Tv shows, newspapers, books, etc	10
30742	4596	All the things to make them happy.We must enjoy what we have in this life	11
30743	4596	People always say that the world is going to end	12
30744	4596	But it wont, for this we will live on in the after life.	13
30745	4597	BAD @CAPS1     Do you really want your kids to see bad immages or read bad prompts	0
30746	4597	I dident think so	1
30747	4597	you can help by teaching them what is right or wrong good or bad	2
30748	4597	You need to help them have a clere cnochience so when they come across these obsticalls in life they will know what to do	3
30749	4597	You could do what my aunt @PERSON1 does	4
30750	4597	Whenever she goes through the check out ile at a local @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or other stores she turns the magazines that she thinks is innaproperate around	5
30751	4597	My mom and dad say this is a silent protest, because she is hurting no one else she just simply dosent like it	6
30752	4597	It makes my dad upset when ever he watches tella vision with us and thier is some thing that they never saw on @CAPS4  like half naked girls on the comershals so he will turn the channel or shut it off	7
30753	4597	because he dosent want us exposed the bad thngs of the world	8
30754	4597	My mom is the same way but she wont let us watch @NUM1 movies if i wanted to watch thies i was usually at my friends house	9
30755	4597	My mom would probably be a little upset	10
30756	4597	I think books are ok because you dont see alot of picture books you have to read them and imagine the image i their head	11
30757	4597	In conclusion i hope you would feel the same way i do so next time you go through that check out stop and say to your self do i want little eyes to see this	12
30758	4597	Then you should turn that maggizne around turn off the @CAPS4 and the music,you should also ead the book so you know what it is  about	13
30759	4598	To whom it @MONTH1 concern:          As time goes on in this ever-expanding world of ours, it seems that one thing that is constantly being fought and argued is censorship	0
30760	4598	Censorship allows things in our world that are viewed as 'offensive' to be comprimised	1
30761	4598	People these days though	2
30762	4598	must be getting offended much more easily these days, because it seems that media is censored more than it ever has been	3
30763	4598	I for one, am sick of having the 'veil over the eyes' as it were	4
30764	4598	Most censorship in this country is run through programs our government has established, censorship shouldn't be up to a organization, but instead to the person viewing it	5
30765	4598	In other words, why should other people decide what is most pleasant for us to watch	6
30766	4598	Nobody knows you better than yourself, so why shouldn't you decide	7
30767	4598	Why should censorship exsist in our media if it doesn't exsist in our everyday lives	8
30768	4598	There are plenty of things people see that they regret seeing, it's all in how you take it	9
30769	4598	No matter who it is, people are going to see things they don't want to see, that's just life	10
30770	4598	Censorship denies our rights as @CAPS1 citizens to have the right for free speech	11
30771	4598	If you don't like something you're seeing, then look away yourself	12
30772	4599	Should materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines be removed from the shelves if they are offensive	0
30773	4599	I don't think so, because it might not be offensive to every body, it would be brakeing the law, and it's not fair to the artist that created them	1
30774	4599	Just because it's offensive to one person donsn't mean it is offensive to everyone	2
30775	4599	For example, some people might think the @CAPS1 is offensive, while to others, it's there religion	3
30776	4599	It would just go to show that one mans garbage, is another mans tresher	4
30777	4599	It would also be braking the law, because it would not be giving the artist their freedom of speech	5
30778	4599	It would silense all the great artist out there, trying to be herd	6
30779	4599	They should be able to write, sing, or film what ever they want	7
30780	4599	It is their right to do so	8
30781	4599	That is the resion why they souldn't be removed from the shelves	9
30782	4599	It wouldn't be fair to the artist that created them, it would be braking the law, and what one person thinks isn't what every one thinks	10
30783	4600	Censorship is method of limiting certain contant that has been deemed inapropriate	0
30784	4600	This method is widely used today in the modern world	1
30785	4600	Censorship is used most commonly with our movies, video games, and television	2
30786	4600	If other forms of entertainent like television and internet utilize such methods shouldn't our libraries.Also if these methods are not made manditory should there be a block on certain tittles that our children could get there hands on	3
30787	4600	This limiting agent called censorship can be very usefull in our everyday lives	4
30788	4600	Censorship could allow us to keep track of what our children and teens view	5
30789	4600	This agent can currently be installed on such products as our televisions, computers, and phones	6
30790	4600	So if the procautionary measuers are being taken on the following products wouldn't it be appropriate for the actions to also be in our libraries	7
30791	4600	Shouldn't our libraries be a place for children to waunder through the shelves picking up and reading books at random without the thought of picking up an inaproiate book for their age group	8
30792	4600	Personally that is what a library should be like to me	9
30793	4600	Discussing the topic that was touched on before .A block should be manditory for libraries	10
30794	4600	This block would not abolish the books completly but rather would limit their viewing audience	11
30795	4600	The books should be cateragized by age group	12
30796	4600	And with the block certain children, based on age ,would not be able to enter the section and would prevent certain materals from reaching children that are not mature enough	13
30797	4600	Certain materials should not be view by younger children	14
30798	4600	That is not only a statement based on opinion but also of fact	15
30799	4600	The factual experiance comes into play when young children are reading and looking at pictures that were intended for maturer audiences	16
30800	4600	These tittles heavily influence a childs thoughts and actions	17
30801	4600	Just the other day a cousin of mine no older than @NUM1 years old was watching two individuals of the opposite sex and began asking questions such as: when are they going to kiss	18
30802	4600	or why is he not touching her	19
30803	4600	These questions do not come naturally but only through her viewing of material that she was not ready to view	20
30804	4600	The origin of these question will probably never be known but there are ways to prevent such topics from being brought up and that is censoring what children read, view or listen to in our libraries	21
30805	4601	Your @CAPS1     @CAPS2 are many things done and said in this world today that people take offense to	0
30806	4601	It could be something someone said about one's relgion, or taking away @CAPS1 of others	1
30807	4601	Do you believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and articles should be taken off the shelves at stores just because people find it offensive	2
30808	4601	I don'@CAPS3 believe it should work that way	3
30809	4601	@CAPS2 are a variety of different relgions, races, and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf everytime found it offensive we would have nothing left to sell	4
30810	4601	When it comes to younger children they are not going to know what to think and believe	5
30811	4601	When seeing and hearing things, children start to believe it	6
30812	4601	The media that adults find offensive should not be published and out in the open for children to see and listen to	7
30813	4601	Even though the kids @MONTH1 not take offense to any of the media, you still have to think about the parents and what they believe is right for their children	8
30814	4601	Many effects on life are put into the media everyday for everyone to see, and some parents @MONTH1 not find it suitable for their children to be hearing about it	9
30815	4601	Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big effect on children and their lives today	10
30816	4601	I believe it is our responsibiltyto protect from all harm until they are old enough to fight for themselves, and make their own judgements	11
30817	4601	Our religion is a big part of your life because it determines what we believe in, and in we think is right or wrong	12
30818	4601	Your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong	13
30819	4601	I was taught to always be respectful to others and try my hardest in whatever it is I @MONTH1 do	14
30820	4601	Some people @MONTH1 have an actor or actress as their role model, so whenever they see that certain person on @CAPS3.V., you tend to think that whatever they do is okay for you to do	15
30821	4601	Some parents @MONTH1 take offense to a show on the television because they don'@CAPS3 believe that is right for their kid to be watching	16
30822	4601	While others don'@CAPS3 see a problem with it	17
30823	4601	So if we cancel that show on @CAPS3.V., you are making one family happy and many others upset	18
30824	4601	When it comes to the movies, people have their own different ratings for movies, but the state rates them whenever they come out	19
30825	4601	Now at movie theaters you must be eighteen to see a @CAPS5 rated movie, or you must have a parent with you because you going by yourself and your parents not knowing get upset those of manys	20
30826	4601	With libraries and movie theaters they have what the state thinks is for adults only in their own little section	21
30827	4601	My parents believe that if @CAPS2 is a law for something it is @CAPS2 for a reason and we are going to obide them	22
30828	4601	As with some parents they have their own rules	23
30829	4601	Such as some parents think it's okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on	24
30830	4601	A few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated @CAPS6	25
30831	4601	I didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it and just turned they movie on and we watched it	26
30832	4601	It had a few words in it that his parents didn'@CAPS3 agree to him watching, and he really liked the movie	27
30833	4601	His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age	28
30834	4601	He didn'@CAPS3 know any better and since he thought it was so great, he was walking up to people saying that quote	29
30835	4601	His mother was not happy and asked where he had heard it from and he told her the movie, and she didn'@CAPS3 think that he needed to be saying that and he got in trouble	30
30836	4601	I told her it was my fault, I let him watch the movie and didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age	31
30837	4601	It just comes to show that, @CAPS2 are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on	32
30838	4601	So if we took something off the shelf because someone took offense to it, we would have nothing left in this world today	33
30839	4601	We learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed	34
30840	4601	What we learn outside of school is up to your parents based on what they believe	35
30841	4601	So if @CAPS2 is something out @CAPS2 you don'@CAPS3 believe in stay away from it, and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it	36
30842	4602	How many of you out there absolutely love to read	0
30843	4602	Well, im going to be the first to confess that I do not prefer reading	1
30844	4602	Meanwhile, whether or not I prefer or differ readings of all types, I despise of any negative books	2
30845	4602	Censoring books is very important in today's lifestyle	3
30846	4602	One can make an inference by looking at the cover of a book	4
30847	4602	The cover oftens creates a vivid image and will usually promote a general idea	5
30848	4602	Let's look at some reasons why I feel that graphic or offensive books should be removed from book shelves	6
30849	4602	What about the younger children who like to read	7
30850	4602	Although kids have a wild imaginaion, authors should't fill their heads with too many crazy ideas	8
30851	4602	First of all, kids now days either grab a book from the shelf and show interest very quickly, or automatically assume it's not for them	9
30852	4602	Furthermore, when a kid comes across a very offensive book it could hurt there feelings	10
30853	4602	Books are supposed to provide eductional information or be entertaining	11
30854	4602	They should not be dirty, nor discouraging towards certain people	12
30855	4602	More importantly, how many different races are there here in @LOCATION1, or even all around the world	13
30856	4602	Many different races take interest in new books to learn new ways	14
30857	4602	When they come across books that are not teaching for all races or are actknowledging bad examples on thier kind, they feel discouraged	15
30858	4602	Whether it's a movie, magazine, books, or even a song, never should it be offensive towards anyone	16
30859	4602	When authors, publishers, song writers, or movie producers release these items, they do not think of the surroundings	17
30860	4602	Thier main concept is to entertain, but sometimes entertainment can be quite bashful	18
30861	4602	Most importantly, if it contains sexual gestures it should be removed without debate	19
30862	4602	It's offensive to parents with young children who visit libraries	20
30863	4602	A public library which is open to all, should have sections for books, movies, cd's or magazines that are too vivid	21
30864	4602	There's a wide range of books laying around and one @MONTH1 come across one that is strongly offensive	22
30865	4602	I believe they should have a word in whether or not the book belongs on the shelf or not	23
30866	4602	I've not experienced it yet, but believe me it could happen anytime in our world today	24
30867	4602	If i was a parent I wouldn't encourage sexual magazines or books being shown at a public library	25
30868	4602	Finally, during this debate older or more dirty minded people will counterargue this topic	26
30869	4602	Who says children should be allowed in the adult sections	27
30870	4602	Why are the discouraged people reading books that are setting bad examples	28
30871	4602	Those are some of the questions you will here for those who counter what I've written today	29
30872	4602	Adults should be allowed there own personal section for adultlike books, movies, or magazines	30
30873	4602	Kids under age should stick to searching for books in areas or fields that will provide interest for them	31
30874	4602	In conclusion, those who counterargue could be on the winning side, however I still believe offensive books should be removed from shelves	32
30875	4602	Book lovers all around the world want enteratinment, but in good ways	33
30876	4602	The younger children of our time right now need to be influenced the proper way	34
30877	4602	Furthermore, there is no better way to help improve society than by removing offensive and noninfluential books from libraries	35
30878	4602	Lets make an inference and say, if we work to remove these offensive books, younger children will become more educated.	36
30879	4604	What happened to everyone having the right to have freedom of knoledge	0
30880	4604	I do not believe that certain materials should be removed only for the reason that someone finds it 'offensive' or 'inappropriate'	1
30881	4604	Our youth have the right to access these materials	2
30882	4604	Kids should have that right because it allows more access to knoledge, it provides more realistic details about life, and keeps them from being shut out from the world around them	3
30883	4604	We cannot deprive children of that	4
30884	4604	First of all, all children and students at schools all over should have access to more knoledge	5
30885	4604	If certain materials are censored and taken away, they cannot access that type of learning	6
30886	4604	What if a student wants to learn more about how goverment and politics work by reading an an article	7
30887	4604	But then, the article is taken away because of one small comment in it	8
30888	4604	We cannot take away our aspiration to learn more about the world	9
30889	4604	Secondly, it can give a more realistic image of a person, place, thing, or event	10
30890	4604	Explicit content can give children more details about how things really are in life	11
30891	4604	If that is taken away, they might have a different understanding of how things really are and have different expectations of things	12
30892	4604	This might have an emotional or psycalogical impact on them once they see the real world	13
30893	4604	They should be well informed of what life is like in further detail to avoid confusion once they get to that point	14
30894	4604	Finally, they could be shut out from the world if everything is kept from them because of censorship	15
30895	4604	Being kept from that kind of knoledge can be an emotional strain	16
30896	4604	A friend of mine had parents that kept her from many things in the world around her, blinding her from what she should have known	17
30897	4604	As she got older, things became harder and harder for her	18
30898	4604	And now, she is affraid of many things out in the real world	19
30899	4604	This is all because her parents had used cencorship to keep her from knowing what was important	20
30900	4604	Our students should always have access to knoledge, details about life, and not kept from knowing enough to have an undertanding of things in our modern world	21
30901	4604	We cannot allow censorship to make such irrational descisions about what we do and do not have access to	22
30902	4604	And if it has such a negative impact on society and our youth, why isn't it censored	23
30903	4605	Hello I am kristin, I am here to tell you why we should take some magazines out of our public libraries	0
30904	4605	Now I dont know if you have heard about @CAPS1 the magazine or @CAPS2 magazine	1
30905	4605	But I have and I also use to read them	2
30906	4605	In some of thouse issues are sex tips	3
30907	4605	Now if I was a mother and my child ran up to me beging me to let them cheek that thing out I would look at them and say no	4
30908	4605	They dont need to undestand sex untill they are in there teens or atleast thirteen or fourteen	5
30909	4605	A child shouldnt be able to even go near that area they should only be able to go near the children's section	6
30910	4605	Some parents think like me and agree with the fact that a child shouldn't learn about sex	7
30911	4605	But others are like why not they are going to know about it in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and when they are married also	8
30912	4605	There are also some other things that need out of a librarie	9
30913	4605	Some music might not be the best choice for a young child	10
30914	4605	Like for example rap music	11
30915	4605	It has allot of cussing in it and talking about sex	12
30916	4605	Some of the things said in a rap song are shorty let me rind you like a huricain	13
30917	4605	Thats just like saying hey chick lets do it for the heck of it	14
30918	4605	Thats not what I want my kid to listen to	15
30919	4605	I want my child to listen to stuff that says hey lets go outside and camp or duck duck gusse	16
30920	4605	Some movies are okay to watch with your kids as long as its not over @NUM1	17
30921	4605	But if it is they can't watch it	18
30922	4605	I'll give you another example my little neice is probubly around the age of ten or so	19
30923	4605	She watche's @CAPS5 @CAPS6 but only with her parents inthe same room as her	20
30924	4605	She can not watch it by herself or she will get grounded	21
30925	4605	This is why some of the stuff should be taken out of our public Libraries	22
30926	4606	I believe that some materials we have in our shelf belongs to basically anybody in the world	0
30927	4606	I also think that the materials on that shelf is allowed to be removed as long as those materials get put back in that spot no matter what	1
30928	4606	My experiance with books are not really that great but i do like to read at times when i have the spare time to read	2
30929	4606	When i get a book i look at the book and i observe it so that way when i take it out of the library i know i wanted to read that book and observe the great thing about the book.when i read the book im not a very fast reader but when im reading i like to know how this book is gunna end and how it begans	3
30930	4606	If i was to pick a magazine from the library i wouldn't take it out of the library cause magazines are expensive to get at times and also hard to replace if it was ever needed to be replaced	4
30931	4606	But if i was to get one i would look at the important stuff on what it is and how to get it and all that kind of stuff	5
30932	4606	their are times when i think movies shouldn't able the library cause people could take ideas off of movies and/or steal them	6
30933	4606	movies in libraries would be expensive to pay if it was tooken from the library	7
30934	4606	if i was to watch a movie i would enjoy it as much as possible cause once that day comes to turn it in their is no chance of watching it after i turn it in	8
30935	4606	Music is passion to most people	9
30936	4606	most people would just go out and buy some cd's or something to listen to and their are music i would listen to so that i get an idea on what to play if i ever wanted to become an musician or something like that	10
30937	4606	their are times when i would write down the lyrics to a song so that way i can understand what the singer is singing about, either that or listen to the song over and over again	11
30938	4606	My point is if something comes off the shelf is should return to its rightful spot or otherwise their will be consequences and people will not be trusted much longer	12
30939	4607	Do yo think censorship is a good thing	0
30940	4607	Do you think libraries should take more responsability on what they offer to people	1
30941	4607	Many people think they should	2
30942	4607	But I disagree, if they dont want to learn about that topic than don't read the book	3
30943	4607	Public libraries are a great help for the community	4
30944	4607	They are reallly helpful for children who dont have certain materials at home	5
30945	4607	Libraries do think about what information children view	6
30946	4607	That is why there are restricted areas for children of certain age	7
30947	4607	Also its not always about what the library displays, but also about the parents who let their kids read things they are not supposed to read	8
30948	4607	If to some people some information is offensive, to others it might not	9
30949	4607	People will always have different points of view	10
30950	4607	This materials cannot be removed, they might be important in some  points of our lifes	11
30951	4607	All information is helpful in some way	12
30952	4607	The inmense ammount of knowledge our libraries have should not be taken away just because someone want to	13
30953	4608	Librarys are filled with hundreds of materials that many @CAPS4 like and dislike	0
30954	4608	Books on @PERSON1 and @CAPS1, @CAPS2	1
30955	4608	Those books are @CAPS3 there to offend you they're there to educate you on the subject	2
30956	4608	Censorship should be only for the youth as an adult you are open to everything	3
30957	4608	You make your own desicons and live by them	4
30958	4608	If you feel like a book, a song, a movie, is offensive, then stop reading, listening, or watching	5
30959	4608	@CAPS3 everyone gets offended	6
30960	4608	I believe that no citizen has the right to remove anything from a library because of the @NUM1- @CAPS3 every one is @NUM2- @CAPS4 have diffrent @CAPS2 and outlooks on @NUM3- @CAPS5 the @CAPS6	7
30961	4608	I conclude this by saying that censorship is enforced, but shouldnt be to a great extent, @CAPS7 us do what we do, and learn what we learn	8
30962	4608	In school were forsed to learn what we learn, i believe @CAPS5 right to have out side knowledge, but only way that is that we get it from data bases such as computers, books, music, art, etc	9
30963	4609	Libraries are places of learning	0
30964	4609	Books, magazines, movies, and all types of media are placed there for the same specific purpose: to learn and explore	1
30965	4609	When we visit libraries, we expect to find the information that we came there looking for	2
30966	4609	Whether the topic is something as simple as wanting to learn about a type of flower or researching the infamous 'In @CAPS1 @CAPS2', we want the truth and information in its rawest form	3
30967	4609	Materials should never be denied from the library	4
30968	4609	It always has some kind of value	5
30969	4609	Whether it be for cultural,spiritual, entertainment, or whatever kind of purpose, books can serve as a purpose for information and exploration into a new world	6
30970	4609	Books that are viewed as 'censored', are only being viewed from one standpoint	7
30971	4609	Another person might find this book exactly what they are looking for	8
30972	4609	If someone sees a book as 'offensive' they must step into another person's shoes and see where they are coming from	9
30973	4609	where this type of information @MONTH1 be helpful to someone else	10
30974	4609	Touchy issues such as the @CAPS3 or books to do with religion @MONTH1 be considered censored, but that's only concerning one group of people	11
30975	4609	What about the other percentage	12
30976	4609	Now, don't get me wrong	13
30977	4609	I don't think that racy or graphic movies or magazines should be allowed into the library, but any type of material containing legitiment cultural, educational, entertaining, and others of the sort, purposes should ever be denied from the library	14
30978	4609	From working at a local library, I know that when people sign up to be a member of the library they sign an agreement that they know what kind of materials they can check out	15
30979	4609	So forth for agreeing with what they're allowing to let their children check out	16
30980	4609	If parents and guardians think that libraries are pushing censored content on their children, they should read the fine print	17
30981	4609	They are allowing their children to be exposed to this	18
30982	4609	And all 'this' is, is information and entertainment in the raw	19
30983	4609	Libraries are created to allow an open access to information for anyone	20
30984	4609	These materials should include information on any topic the library can get in their possession	21
30985	4609	None should be denied	22
30986	4609	People rely on libraries as a source of knowledge, and we need to work to keep that source ever growing	23
30987	4611	What if one day you took a trip to the library, and you came across a book that was offensive	0
30988	4611	Would you ask for it to be taken off the shelf or just ignore it	1
30989	4611	Every year tons of @CAPS1 visit libraries in search of a good book, threw act of observations and personal appeal	2
30990	4611	Everyone has a different choose in the types of books they'd like to read, with that comes offensive and non-offensive material	3
30991	4611	Being a teen i've had some experience visiting the library where things come across as offensive to me more easily than others but like many i choose to ignore it	4
30992	4611	Reasons for ignoring it are rather simple, everyone has different takes on things in which they've gathered since birth as we'll as personal life experiences	5
30993	4611	Because, everyone has different life experiences comes different views on what offends them or not	6
30994	4611	Personal experiences i've had in the library are from race seeing books that relate to the days of slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to me	7
30995	4611	But, a book on the black panther organization maybe offensive to someone else	8
30996	4611	So, does that mean it should be taken down off the shelf because it is offensive to both people	9
30997	4611	Books have diffent tones weither its on life, politics, or worldly issues that make different people feel different ways	10
30998	4611	I've observed plenty of times where someone feels uplifted from reading a book	11
30999	4611	Where someone else reads the same thing and feels terrible	12
31000	4611	Take a magazine for instance, one reader could look like that beautiful women in that magazine and feel great about themselves	13
31001	4611	While maybe an overweight reader could read the same magazine and feel like there not beautiful or self worthy as the women in the magazine	14
31002	4611	That overweight women could feel offended, while the other women feels amazing, because of that simple reason it shouldn't be taken off the shelves due to different views of what offends them and what doesn't	15
31003	4611	Everyone reads books due to there liking and what relates to them	16
31004	4611	If a book, magazine, or movie comes across as offensive then that reader probably won't pick it up to find out more about it	17
31005	4611	When i come across material in a library that is offensive to me i won't read it	18
31006	4611	Although i have picked up books that didn't come across as offensive, but after reading the material come to find out it was offensive	19
31007	4611	In response i simply returned the book and chose another one	20
31008	4611	If i walked into a library and saw a book that was offensive to me i wouldn't ask for it to be taken off the shelf i would simply ignore it	21
31009	4611	Everyone has different views on what offense them so there's not much you can do except just ignore it	22
31010	4611	If the case was that if a book were to offend someone and it was taken out of a library due to just that there would be no real need for a library	23
31011	4612	In the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1', books are outlawed	0
31012	4612	In such a society, owning a book would result in recieving a punishment	1
31013	4612	Without books, @CAPS2 people turned to electronics for entertainment	2
31014	4612	The society as a whole had lost @CAPS2 human emotions and became submissive to the government	3
31015	4612	@CAPS4 led to injustices that the government inflicted upon its people because it didn't have any opposition	4
31016	4612	Katherine Paterson suggests that if books begin to be thrown out, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive	5
31017	4612	However, if every piece of media that was requested to be removed was taken out, @CAPS2 important works would be thrown away	6
31018	4612	A recent debate has arisen over @PERSON1's 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 book is set in the @LOCATION3 during the time of slavery	7
31019	4612	@ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON4 befriends a black man, @PERSON6, and shares @CAPS2 experiences with him along the @LOCATION1	8
31020	4612	@PERSON1 decided to write his book using the true diction of the people who lived in the @LOCATION3 during @CAPS4 time period	9
31021	4612	He was the first author to do @CAPS4	10
31022	4612	Because he wrote it in @CAPS4 way, the book contains the n-word multiple times	11
31023	4612	@CAPS4 word is not acceptable today, and therefore @CAPS2 people take offense to his work	12
31024	4612	However, @CAPS4 book plays a major role in the @CAPS5 cannon	13
31025	4612	@PERSON1's work was written in a new and breakthrough method	14
31026	4612	If someone were to remove @CAPS4 work off of the shelves of libraries, he would remove one of the most important pieces of @CAPS5 literature	15
31027	4612	'@ORGANIZATION2' by @PERSON3 is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison	16
31028	4612	During his time at @LOCATION2, he discovers that he is a homosexual	17
31029	4612	He falls in love with a man named @PERSON5 and begins to have sexual relationships with @CAPS2 of the men in his cell	18
31030	4612	These relationships are described in detail	19
31031	4612	If one were to read the surface of the book, he would find a crude description of a convict's experience in prison	20
31032	4612	However, @CAPS4 is not the case	21
31033	4612	@PERSON3 struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life	22
31034	4612	He also had problems with his parents and brother	23
31035	4612	In '@PERSON2', he wrote about his own feelings through his characters	24
31036	4612	@CAPS4 story is not about sex, but about feelings of entrapment and the relationships one has with other people	25
31037	4612	If @CAPS4 book were to be removed from libraries, @CAPS2 people would miss a story that they might connect with	26
31038	4612	Katherine Paterson brings up an interesting question	27
31039	4612	What would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike	28
31040	4612	The answer would be a society that is unable to share ideas, concerns, and experiences	29
31041	4612	Media helps to enlighten, persuade, and educate people about important issues	30
31042	4612	While some works @MONTH1 have offensive language, they also have a deeper meaning.	31
31043	4613	To the newspaper edits,Should books, music, movies, magzines, and other reading materials, be removed if the materials are view to be offensive	0
31044	4613	I do not think that is a good idea	1
31045	4613	Reasons why is that just like what @PERSON1 an Author (in the last sentence) said if we remove books from shelfs there will be 'no more books for any of us to read'	2
31046	4613	That is true because I am sure there are lotts of books that @MONTH1 be offensive to people but maybe the readers who get offensive do not understand the materials that they read	3
31047	4613	For example the topic of liking the same gender has become a problem, maybe the reader who gets offensived about those types of topics just do not understand it or @MONTH1 not get it	4
31048	4613	An other reason why could be because we are in america, and the last time I checked we have the free will to write and talk about what we want to talk or write about	5
31049	4613	Its fair to say that because well, it is true we has people of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 just have the 'right' to say what they want to say or what is on their mind	6
31050	4613	And just because the topic of the reading material offensives them does not mean you can take away the writers material	7
31051	4613	Doing that is like putting duck tape on the writers mouth	8
31052	4613	If the reader has the right to say what in on your mind then what is the maining of being free to write what you wish to write	9
31053	4613	If you can see where I am coming from it takes a lott not to talk to a teacher or someone in a highter postition from the reader, about something you do not understand and they tell you 'you can not ask me that' or 'do not say a thing to me' it is the same if you remove the book from the writer	10
31054	4613	Other reasons why to say no to removing the reading material could be because has humans we always are willing to learn something new, by @CAPS3	11
31055	4613	When a person reads they always learn something new	12
31056	4613	It could be a new event, a place unknown, grammer, the diffrent styles of writing, or know more about the topic	13
31057	4613	@CAPS3 in books, music, movies, and magazines is a good way to learn new things it is fun and what is better then @CAPS3 something fun	14
31058	4613	can not think of anything	15
31059	4613	well it is because @CAPS3 has a big role in our lives	16
31060	4613	Another reason why not to remove the reading materials is because it @MONTH1 make other reads feel like they are not alone	17
31061	4613	Like a true story about a break up, of a family or a relationship	18
31062	4613	Or it could be a story base on something that happening to the writer like about a death of a loved @CAPS5 and how to deal with it	19
31063	4613	Just picture it two @CAPS4 girls, @CAPS5 is mad at herself  and at the world and hates a tape about angles	20
31064	4613	While the other @CAPS4 girl just lost her grandmother and listening to the tape about angles makes her feel together or whole, knowing that her loved @CAPS5 is in a good place	21
31065	4613	Now think about it the second girl would start to be like the first girl sad, alone, or leaved out	22
31066	4613	When you take away a material like a small tape from the librarie's shelf you take away a feeling with it not only from the writer but from the reader's too	23
31067	4613	Finally the last reason why not to remove the materials from the shelfs is because if you remove the material from the shelf it is likly that the topic is still there	24
31068	4613	It could be on the radio, on the internet, on the @ORGANIZATION1 and what can you do delete all of that	25
31069	4613	it is not reality	26
31070	4613	And if that could even happening which is unlikly that it would people can still talk	27
31071	4613	And there is nothing that can stop people from talking	28
31072	4613	'you can lock a bird in a cage but it still wants to fly away' or 'you can tell a cat or a dog not to run away but when you turn away it is gone' this are explambles of what I am trying to say, you can try to remove books, music, magazines, but the topic you dont like is still out there	29
31073	4613	I understand that reading some materials @MONTH1 offend you but its better to just turn your head around and move on.The reader @MONTH1 not like the topic but others would and thats always good to think about	30
31074	4613	And maybe the problem is that the reader does not get the topic then maybe you should read it to learn from it, and to give it a chance you @MONTH1 end up likeing it or understanding it better	31
31075	4613	Books, music, movies, magazines there is a reason why they are out there and it could teach you something new so why not  learn it.	32
31076	4614	Offensive articles and or movies and magazines etc should not be pulled from shelves	0
31077	4614	If individuals choose to read and/or watch the material that is their personal choice  @CAPS1 I think there should be an age limit for the material	1
31078	4614	If individuals find the material offensive they should turn their back and not read or watch the programs	2
31079	4614	If the items are in a public library they should be kept in a separate area for those who wish to view them	3
31080	4614	They should not be kept in the open for small children or for people who do not wish to see them	4
31081	4614	Historic material such as diaries and accounts of events should be held at federal libraries	5
31082	4614	Having these documents in a public library could interest small children in reading  things that are inappropriate for them	6
31083	4614	Certain items such as magazines, and newspapers and books, some of these items are held at a public level	7
31084	4614	Governement affiliated documents should be held at a federal library such as parts of history and important documents	8
31085	4614	High profile documents such as the constitution should be held in high security areas	9
31086	4614	In conclusion people who wish to view certain material should be able to do so as I had previously stated	10
31087	4614	They should not be out in the open for small children	11
31088	4614	It should be held in a separate area   If people do not wish to view this material they simply do not go in that area	12
31089	4614	Having an age limit in place for this material is key so that small children do not view it and get the wrong message	13
31090	4614	Having certain doements in public and certain documents in federal libraries is a factor	14
31091	4614	Certain historical doeuments and other items that are affiliated with the government should be held at a federal level as well as important documents related to the country	15
31092	4614	These documents should be high profile secure areas	16
31093	4615	Communities have many different types of people that live in them	0
31094	4615	Certain groups of people find some things offensive while others find them totally nomal	1
31095	4615	Some of these things cause conflict	2
31096	4615	A library, for example, is one place you @MONTH1 find some of these conflicts	3
31097	4615	Most libraries are open to the public	4
31098	4615	Therefore, many different groups of people will be sharing the material in the library such as books, movies, magazines, and music	5
31099	4615	Having many different kinds of people sharing this material, the libraries must try to have material to please everyone	6
31100	4615	This is where the conflict begins	7
31101	4615	While trying to please everyone, some people @MONTH1 find some of the material offensive	8
31102	4615	Now for the big question: Should material some find offensive be removed from the shelves all together	9
31103	4615	The answer to this big question is no	10
31104	4615	Libraries must have many different kinds of materials in them to please everyone in the community	11
31105	4615	People are different and believe in different things	12
31106	4615	Just because one person finds some type of material offensive doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone	13
31107	4615	For example, things such as religion	14
31108	4615	Someone @MONTH1 find a book on a type of religion and find it very offensive, but others @MONTH1 strongly believe in that reigion	15
31109	4615	Just because one person takes it offensively, doesn't mean those who don't should have it taken away from them	16
31110	4615	Libraries are for all kinds of people	17
31111	4615	Just because one person finds the material offensive, doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone else	18
31112	4615	If libraries took any material that anyone found offensive in any way off the shelves, there would be no material left	19
31113	4615	People believe in different things	20
31114	4615	That is the way it always has been and more than likely, the way it will always be	21
31115	4616	I thnk the censorship in libraries @CAPS1 quite abominomal	0
31116	4616	I think there should be no censorship, it @CAPS1 for the parents to decide what children can an cannot watch	1
31117	4616	I think if something @CAPS1 found offensive, then don't watch it, it's as simple as that	2
31118	4616	If you don't want your children to watch anything offensive or rude, then don't let them	3
31119	4616	What I think offensive, @CAPS1 when something @CAPS1 removed off shelves	4
31120	4616	I think kids, though not yung kids, perhaps @NUM1 and up, should be able to watch and listen to what they want	5
31121	4616	I think certain things that people find offensive, are only offensive to those kind of people	6
31122	4616	It @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else, so don't take that particular movie, or song out of libraries.A good example of this would be the book, To @CAPS2 A @CAPS4	7
31123	4616	It has been banned and then unbanned from many school libraries, because of its vulgar words and references to rape	8
31124	4616	i think that @CAPS1 unfair because , wether we like it or not, children @NUM1 and over will most definatly hear rude and offensive things anyways	9
31125	4616	I think books, or movies, or music, that have curse words, @CAPS1 a part of life, because most adults curse	10
31126	4616	And taking those things away from a library @CAPS1 taking it away from adults as well as kids	11
31127	4616	It @CAPS1 for the parents to decide when their kids hear these things, if at any time	12
31128	4616	I also believe that using ' offensive' remarks, @CAPS1 just another part of our history	13
31129	4616	Take To @CAPS2 A @CAPS4 for instance, back in that time, it was common for black people to talk slang, and common for men to curse when mad	14
31130	4616	That @CAPS1 just how people are and were	15
31131	4616	Taking those things off the shelves, will not protect adolescents from hearing them	16
31132	4616	I think they have rights to hear it if they want, and there parents have rights enough to let them	17
31133	4616	I think songs that have words bleeped out over the radio @CAPS1 pointless because you teenager will know what they say anyway	18
31134	4616	I think having books banned @CAPS1 a not wise thing to do, because it just makes kids want to hear the word more than usual	19
31135	4616	Basically we have rights to hear and read those things	20
31136	4616	Taking away the things we have rights to, @CAPS1 taking away our freedom and free will	21
31137	4616	If parents don't want to have their children read or hear those things, then they need to supervise what they read or listen to	22
31138	4616	It doesnt't make snese to single out a particular book, or song, that @CAPS1 just like singling out all songs and books	23
31139	4617	Everyone has found something offensive throughout their life	0
31140	4617	However, many people find different things offensive than others	1
31141	4617	There are many different topics that people are offended of whether it is race, religion,gender,etc	2
31142	4617	If there is a book that you find offensive in a public library I do not think it should be removed	3
31143	4617	It is like removing something just because one person does not like it	4
31144	4617	That would not be fair to everyone else that goes to that library	5
31145	4617	It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but to another person it @MONTH1 not be	6
31146	4617	There are many reasons that book could be in the library	7
31147	4617	It could help someone write a paper, to learn about a subject, or do some research on a topic	8
31148	4617	If all the books, music, magazines,movies or any other item in a library was to be removed if one person found it offensive then there would hardly be any books at all left in the library	9
31149	4617	I think all books should be kept in the library even if one person finds its offensive	10
31150	4617	It could be offensive to them but not to someone else	11
31151	4617	If one person finds a book offensive and another person doesn't then it is not fair to the one that isn't offened to not be able to check it out	12
31152	4617	If the concern is if children check it out what they might be learning from it then that would be the parents fault for not supervising what their children are checking out	13
31153	4617	The child @MONTH1 learn something new from the book	14
31154	4617	Even if it is offensive you could still learn something from the book, movie,magazine, music, etc	15
31155	4617	If you still read the book it could help you change your mind on the topic	16
31156	4617	It @MONTH1 help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of	17
31157	4617	One condition on why a book,movie,magazine,music,etc would be removed would be if everyone agreed on it	18
31158	4617	If everyone that came to that library was offended by it then it @MONTH1 be in the library's best interest to get rid of that book	19
31159	4617	The main idea here is that all books that are in the library should stay in the library	20
31160	4617	The author wrote it for a reason and it should be open to those who want to read it	21
31161	4617	If one person does not like it then they should simply not check the item out	22
31162	4617	If that was what happened everytime someone found something offensive in a library there would be hardly anything to check out	23
31163	4617	Even if it is offensive to you it could come in handy for another person	24
31164	4618	To @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 I am from @ORGANIZATION2	0
31165	4618	I do agree that books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves	1
31166	4618	If they are not something that the kids should learn about then why put them on the shelves	2
31167	4618	Many of the books that children, teens, and adults read is a cause of a lot of violance and threating.That's a major cause these days and we want a clam a peaceful world	3
31168	4618	Many of times we see teens to childern get into fights or have bad mouth to others	4
31169	4618	It's not a good thing to see and its mostly because they are either watching a @CAPS3 show about negtive things or reading a book or just trying to act cool	5
31170	4618	If we could put more important learning books, movies, and ect.	6
31171	4618	there would be less aggression in the world	7
31172	4618	Having a more positive day and going out and saying I read @ORGANIZATION1 wonderful book that taught me something new in life would be the best thing to hear	8
31173	4618	Teaching something that a kid could remember or is helpful in the long run is the greatest thing	9
31174	4618	Knowing that they are doing anything educational is just a great feeling	10
31175	4618	Now when do you see kids actually doing what they are supposed to	11
31176	4618	You really dont cause they are too busy wanting to find trouble to get into	12
31177	4618	That's really not good for them they should always learn about the good things to help them in life	13
31178	4618	It's a tough world out there for these kids and they should be taught the best way that they can	14
31179	4619	Materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
31180	4619	It's a public library	1
31181	4619	Not many people would like to find something that seems to hurt or harm them in any way	2
31182	4619	Libraries are for people to come in and should be expected to enjoy something, whether it be a book, movie or magazine	3
31183	4619	When people come in looking for some good information about something, they look forward to finding good tips, and not being let down	4
31184	4619	Example, with something possibly about someone being racist	5
31185	4619	That's dissapointment to some	6
31186	4619	Noone should have to walk in and find something that offenses them	7
31187	4619	It's not fair	8
31188	4619	Now, to parents with children	9
31189	4619	Would you like for your child going into a library that is allowed to look wherever their little heart desires, and they come upon porn or just anything that would be a bad influence on them	10
31190	4619	I highly doubt it	11
31191	4619	Unless, you just don't care about what your kid reads these days, but to the ones who want their child having a good education, well, you understand my statement	12
31192	4619	It's just not fair to the ones who go to a library expected to be satisfied, but instead are let down	13
31193	4619	It does them no good, and it could make your community look bad	14
31194	4619	Libraries are to help people with information, fun facts, and all around good resources	15
31195	4619	So, please put the bad books, music, magazines, etc	16
31196	4619	away!	17
31197	4620	I beleive censorship is a good thing	0
31198	4620	to an extent	1
31199	4620	I think that censorship deals with an age group and the permission of the parent(s) or guardian(s)	2
31200	4620	If a consumer is the age of twelve and under	3
31201	4620	then the consumer should buy the censored books and etc., but, if you are thirteen and above you should be able to buy product uncensored	4
31202	4620	Some people do not like censored products because they feel it takes away from that particular thing	5
31203	4620	Music, for example, alot of people get angry when the song lyrics on a @CAPS1 are censored	6
31204	4620	It does not allow the people to get the full effect of the music and the 'message' that the artist or band is sending	7
31205	4620	With books	8
31206	4620	people get upset because they cannot get the full aspect of the book	9
31207	4620	Censoring a book is like taking away part of a masterpiece	10
31208	4620	Some books should be censored like alot of romance novels	11
31209	4620	those get pretty graphic and go into alot of detail with sexual themes and content	12
31210	4620	I do not think those books should be on the shelves	13
31211	4620	In magazines	14
31212	4620	it depends on the type of magazine the consumer is reading	15
31213	4620	If a person is reading a politcal magazine	16
31214	4620	those magazines do not put all of the true facts and details into them for certain reasons	17
31215	4620	If a person is reading a hunting or fishing magazine	18
31216	4620	then they can put in all the facts on the guns, calls, lures, and stories they want and do not have to censor them	19
31217	4620	Movies, on the other hand, are censored on certain channels	20
31218	4620	If you are watching a movie on a @CAPS2 network like @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS3	21
31219	4620	those channels censor movies	22
31220	4620	If you watch movies on @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS4 they do not censor the movies because those are movie channels only	23
31221	4620	That is also why movies have ratings	24
31222	4620	R is for restricted to people under seventeen (without an adult present) , @NUM1 is for people of the ages sixteen and under without an adult	25
31223	4620	and @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are fine for any age group	26
31224	4620	All in all	27
31225	4620	censorship depends on what age group the consumer is in really	28
31226	4620	If you are still in elementary school you probably should not be able to buy uncensored products	29
31227	4620	if you are thirteen to about fifteen, you should be able to buy the product with permission from an adult, and if you are sixteen and older you should be able to buy the products uncensored with out an adult present because you know you can handle the 'offensive' matierial	30
31228	4621	Books, music and movies are all important, specially to kids	0
31229	4621	If we decide to take one book off of the shelf, then so will everyone else and the book shelf will be almost empty	1
31230	4621	The same idea for movies, magazines, music, ect	2
31231	4621	Even though, some parents do not accept it for their young children to read or watch uncensored materials from the library, it is the parents' role to supervise their children and choose for them and teach them what is right and what is wrong to read or watch	3
31232	4621	Libraries usually require @CAPS1 cards	4
31233	4621	These @CAPS1 cards allow the person to have access to adults' materials depending on the kind of card the person has	5
31234	4621	Since it is the parents' decision to decide the materials their children have access to, they shouldn't blame anyone if their chilren have taken something they don't like off of the shelf	6
31235	4621	Libraries have done everything that needed to be done to have complete safety for the society	7
31236	4621	If we try to remove every single book, movie, song, or magazine that contain an offensive thing, we would have to remove almost everything	8
31237	4621	People have different cultures and beliefs	9
31238	4621	They might think some things are offensive while other take it as a normal thing	10
31239	4621	In the current society, a lot of people are more attratced to movies or music that contain some unappropriate materials because these materials have recently taken over in the media	11
31240	4621	We can't stop publishing them but we can censor them	12
31241	4621	There are different kinds of channels that view these materials	13
31242	4621	Internet, @ORGANIZATION1, and libraries can all be under parents' supervision	14
31243	4621	Thus, parents can not blame anyone other than themselves, if their children read or saw unacceptable materials	15
31244	4621	Libraries should stay the way the are currently and keep their way of censorship without any change	16
31245	4621	Parents need to have full supervision to their children	17
31246	4621	Libraries enough restrictions and rules on their books and movies based on the persons age	18
31247	4623	In my life time I have been to many libraries	0
31248	4623	I also seen many diffrent catagories of books suck as comedy, fiction, non-fiction, drama, and etc	1
31249	4623	As we all know there are many topics out thier that is not suitable for minors or suitable for many other ages	2
31250	4623	Movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes	3
31251	4623	For example in cartoons their are sexual content such as kissing .Some parents don't want their child expose to the kind of activity yet	4
31252	4623	Movies somtimes put false beliefs in peoples mind about the way things are, going to be,or the why you sould see it.Their are also some good movies place in libraries such ass docomentries, history , biography, and etc	5
31253	4623	Thats gives you good insite on how things was and hoe things are now	6
31254	4623	Another topic is magazines	7
31255	4623	Its strange things going on in the world that @CAPS1 sould be aware of the why we put them in magazines but children have easy access to them in libraries	8
31256	4623	Picture that magzines have are images that sould be places in some magazines	9
31257	4623	As there are bad things there are also good that come from magazine	10
31258	4623	Magazines are in some ways just as useful as books	11
31259	4623	They carry very helpful information	12
31260	4623	Music is aslo a big topic thats placed in libraries	13
31261	4623	Some of the lauguage thats is place on  cd tracks are good BUT  theirs alot of bad material that on them also	14
31262	4623	So many people out the known as @CAPS2 say some very harsh and profaine words that many and children sould just not want to hear	15
31263	4623	Like I said before as their is bad thier is much good	16
31264	4623	We have gospel , jazz, @CAPS3&@CAPS4, and etc that many people enjoy listing to	17
31265	4623	In conclusion thier are many things good that belongs in libraries but also many bad	18
31266	4623	Libraries in my opinion sould take more caution on what people have access to	19
31267	4623	Very easy a young child (that can read) can pick up a adult book go sit in a corner read and be expose to most things parents are expose to	20
31268	4623	So in my opinion yes certin things should be removed from the shelves if the are found offensive.	21
31269	4624	Censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic that has conflicting views	0
31270	4624	One side, in favor of censorship, believes that some literary material contained within a library could be offensive to some, and that it should be removed or censored	1
31271	4624	The other side, in favor of free speech, believes that all literary material in a library should be kept, whether it is seen as offensive or not	2
31272	4624	Of these two sides of such a controversial issue, it is evident that censorship should not be instilled within libraries, because of the right to free speech, the true meanings and expressions must be upheld, and it would take the oppurtunity to read such a work truly from an interested reader	3
31273	4624	The first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech	4
31274	4624	This right belongs to all citizens of @LOCATION1, and shouldn't be taken away because one person @MONTH1 think something is offensive	5
31275	4624	I have observed that many people will often attempt to steal this right from people, and this instillation of censorship will do just that to the authors	6
31276	4624	This is the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor	7
31277	4624	The next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because this censorship @MONTH1 dull down the true meanings and expressive themes that literary works are meant to express	8
31278	4624	An example of a story that would suffer from censorship is the famous 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1.' Such a novel, though containing offensive language at times, would not read the same if such language was omitted and removed	9
31279	4624	Instead, @PERSON1's expressions within the story would be dulled down immensely and be nearly silenced	10
31280	4624	This is the next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor	11
31281	4624	The last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because it removes the availability of the book from an interested reader	12
31282	4624	Many times I have seen people blatantly have a tantrum over an offensive literary work	13
31283	4624	I have been offended by things that I have read before, and instead of demanding its removal and crying for a less offensive substitute, I simply either stopped reading the work or read through it anyways	14
31284	4624	A person must know that the use of offensive language within literary works rarely is intended to attack the reader, but rather to strongly get a point across	15
31285	4624	If a person finds the material too offensive to read, then they should simply stop and find a more suitable work	16
31286	4624	By remaining calm and passive about these things, it keeps the literary work on the shelves in its true form for other people who wish to read it.This is the last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor	17
31287	4624	It is clearly evident that the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is a bad idea as a whole	18
31288	4624	The decision to censor literary works would be bad because it would strip the author's right to free speech, it would dull down the author's true meanings and expressions, and it would remove the oppurtunity to read such a work from an interested person	19
31289	4624	The removal or censorship of literary works would be a terrible decision that all would regret in the years to come	20
31290	4624	This is why the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is an unjust endeavor.	21
31291	4625	Dear @PERSON1 news paper editor	0
31292	4625	Pulling a book, cd, dvd/vcr tape, magazine, etc.,because of whether or not they are offensive or obscene is a panzy move from the people who think the world must be perfect when in reality it is so far from perfect that it is disgusting,and yet the sad truth is the fact that only a small percentage of people on the face of the earth have come to accept this truth	1
31293	4625	If I have not conviced you other wise please keep reading	2
31294	4625	I believe that if the world can not handle what is on the shelf at the public library they should just leave it alone, and stay in there comfort zone of reading seletions	3
31295	4625	If they are offended they can go to read some where else	4
31296	4625	I understand that people might have been there first	5
31297	4625	If that is the case well then nicely ask the person/persons offending you to move some where else	6
31298	4625	The world is not a perfect place by no means	7
31299	4625	The world does have it's positives for instance the @CAPS1 nations, and north atlantic treaty organization (@CAPS2.A.T.O.), but for some reason the world acts as if they are going to die if there is not perfection all around them	8
31300	4625	That means that they decided to strip the libraries all over the world of the offensive and obscenties in all the books so that way boredom and perfection could slowly but surely set into the worlds minds to be okay	9
31301	4625	Well I refuse to let it set into my mind, and I hope you choose the same for yourself	10
31302	4625	Your's @CAPS3                               @CAPS4	11
31303	4626	Reading is something people choose to do for their own entertainment, for their enjoyment,  to gain personal knowledge and many other reasons	0
31304	4626	Reading should not be restricted by any means	1
31305	4626	If a person has an interest in a book, they should be able to read it if they so choose	2
31306	4626	I believe that censorship within a library is not something that should be done	3
31307	4626	For a person to be able to take away another persons right to read a book of his or her choice, is mind boggling	4
31308	4626	I know that some books can be pretty desciptive and graphic but these boundaries sould be set within a home	5
31309	4626	If a parent doesn't want their child reading a book don't take in out on the entire community	6
31310	4626	It's not fair to everyone else	7
31311	4626	If you personally don't find entertainment or enjoyment out of a book that you consider offensive, there are many other alternative books to read	8
31312	4626	Nobody is forcing you to be miserable and read a book you don't like, that is why there are many sections in a library	9
31313	4626	The sections in a library range from mystery to romance, so find a different book and leave the offensive ones to people who like to read them	10
31314	4626	That way you are happy and so is everyone else	11
31315	4626	Libraries are places people visit to check out and read books	12
31316	4626	Usually a person chooses a book because of the cover or a friend has requested you to read it	13
31317	4626	If libraries start to remove books from the shelves then there won't be any left for the rest of us to read	14
31318	4626	Not only will there be no more books but there also won't be anymore libraries for people to go to	15
31319	4626	Just because a few people think that there are some offensive words, scenes and or other ideas in a book doesn't mean that it is right to take away the privilidge of another person to read it	16
31320	4626	If you have a problem with it, don't read it	17
31321	4626	It's that simple	18
31322	4626	Don't make other book readers suffer because of one persons opinion.	19
31323	4627	I do believe that certain books, music, movies, and other media should be removed from the shelves of libraries, if they are found to be offensive	0
31324	4627	We do not need anymore reasons for people to judge someone based on something that they read	1
31325	4627	If the media is offensive, than someone's feelings will get hurt	2
31326	4627	I remember a time when I read a book, and it had some really offensive things about homeless people	3
31327	4627	I felt bad just for reading this, because it just made them sound like horrible people	4
31328	4627	Which in a lot of cases isn't true, but I remember people that read it and they believed of every word of it	5
31329	4627	Those people now rudely look down on them	6
31330	4627	So why would we allow this book to be in the library	7
31331	4627	This book changes the way many people think, and so do many more books	8
31332	4627	There is a lot of offensive music too	9
31333	4627	Today most of the songs people listen to are, but we just don't realize it	10
31334	4627	These should not be available in a library, cause anybody could rent them	11
31335	4627	Which isn't good, cause they could really hurt someone's feelings by just singing a song they think is okay	12
31336	4627	Another thing libraries need to watch are magazines	13
31337	4627	Most magazines are okay, but some like to throw in little inapproiate stories	14
31338	4627	So to really protect everyone and anyone they need to really go through the magizine and make sure its not offensive at all	15
31339	4627	The media I think libraries really need to sit down and think over if they are okay, or not are definately movies	16
31340	4627	They need to realize that kids could rent these, and think are they apporiate	17
31341	4627	I think libraries should only have family oriented movies	18
31342	4627	This way nobody is harmed by anything they will veiw	19
31343	4627	In conclusion, libraries should be extra careful in their media choices	20
31344	4627	They need to try and limit everything that is offensive, to try stop anybody from getting harmed	21
31345	4628	Should there be censorship in libraries	0
31346	4628	Many people will answer this question differently	1
31347	4628	I feel there should be absolutely no censorship in libraries	2
31348	4628	Allowing censorship in libaries is an intrusion of our rights	3
31349	4628	It contradicts freedom of the press	4
31350	4628	If someone wants there opinion to be read they should have that right	5
31351	4628	I also feel censorship in libraries goes against freedom of speach	6
31352	4628	What is writing, but written speach	7
31353	4628	If someone wants to say something, they should be able to say it	8
31354	4628	If a mute person wants to get a point out, they should be able to do so by writing	9
31355	4628	What some people @MONTH1 consider offensive, others @MONTH1 not	10
31356	4628	If someone finds it offensive, they should simply not read it	11
31357	4629	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'	0
31358	4629	This quote says it all, if everybody had their say in what is offensive or not then everything would be offensive	1
31359	4629	Books are often written for the enjoyment of the reader, and if not that books are for informational purposes	2
31360	4629	Not everybody will have the same views of one book as someone else does, so it would be unfair to not be able to read it because someone else doesn't want you too	3
31361	4629	Personally I like to read books that interest me, as i can assume most do everyone else	4
31362	4629	Generally to keep my attention, I like to read books with a lot of action and an intense plot	5
31363	4629	I realize that some people would find this offensive and not acceptable for children, but I consider myself a good kid now and I am not negatively affected by those books I read	6
31364	4629	When I was a kid in @NUM1 grade, I read a book far beyond what most @NUM1 graders read	7
31365	4629	This book contained many vulgar words and even a racial slur, but I was mature enough to handle them	8
31366	4629	Just the other year, the librarian, whom I stay in constant contact with, asked me if she should take the book off the shelf	9
31367	4629	I told her no, with my reason being that I found it to be a very interesting book	10
31368	4629	I would have been upset to see a great book no longer be accessable because of some vulgar language, because what it comes down to are just words that express heavy emotion	11
31369	4629	Many books such as, the dictionary or encyclopedia's are used for informational purposes	12
31370	4629	These books can also be accessed by children	13
31371	4629	I myself as a kid have looked through the dictionary looking for 'bad words'	14
31372	4629	Does that make it jusitifiable to remove	15
31373	4629	Even the books we read in school today have 'bad words' in them	16
31374	4629	When I was a freshman in high school, my @CAPS1 teacher talked about how the school board tried to get rid of 'To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3', because it had racial slurs and much racism involved	17
31375	4629	She was very against getting rid of the book because she found the novel to be a very interesting read for her and her students	18
31376	4629	Books just can't be taken out of the hands of high schoolers because some uptight adults think it is offensive, when in all reality they teach great morals and lessons for the youth	19
31377	4629	If you take a look at politics you can see that not everybody has the same opinion and some can be very vocal about their's	20
31378	4629	The same idea can go with any topic in the world today	21
31379	4629	Somebody thinks one way and someone else thinks the complete opposite	22
31380	4629	This is the issue with taking books off the shelves	23
31381	4629	One person thinks it is a very offensive book and the other thinks it is a very beneficial book	24
31382	4629	My personal opinion is that a book is a book and people are going to interperte them differently	25
31383	4629	So if one book can get taken off the shelves then this will just start a chain reaction until every book is gone	26
31384	4629	There is no point	27
31385	4629	If someone shouldn't read that book then they shouldn't be allowed	28
31386	4629	The answer is as simple as that	29
31387	4629	When it comes down to it people are just going to have to get over not having their way, because they want a book removed from the shelf	30
31388	4629	Most people are offended by something and usually not everybody is offended by the same thing, which makes this issue impossible to deal with	31
31389	4629	There is only one answer to this question of: Should the library be censored	32
31390	4629	The answer is no, just let it be	33
31391	4629	The book was published so there must have been a good reason behind it	34
31392	4629	In the end of it all a book is just a book	35
31393	4630	Have you ever walked into a library and saw a book that you wouldn't what your child or any young one to pick up and read	0
31394	4630	There is several book in the library that young children should read	1
31395	4630	I don't believe that you a certian book should be removed from the library because it is offensive to some or not suitable for children, but there is a few things that can be done to keep those books away from your kids or any child	2
31396	4630	The possable things that could be done is	3
31397	4630	move those book to a higher shelf, designate a certian area for those books, or put an age limit on those books	4
31398	4630	The first way that you could keep an offensive book out of your childs, or any other childs hands is to move those book to a higher shelf	5
31399	4630	Doing this will keep those books out of your childs sight and reach	6
31400	4630	That will keep them out of childens hand, and prevent them from reading them	7
31401	4630	The next possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any childs hand is to, designate a certain area for those books in the library	8
31402	4630	Doing this will provied a 'barrior', so that you could tell your child to stay out of that area, and keep a watch on them to make sure they don't go in that area	9
31403	4630	You would also know where those books are so the you could make sure they don't go to that area	10
31404	4630	The final possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any other childs hands is to put an age limit on those book to keep the children from being able to check-out those books, to read them	11
31405	4630	This would make the childen have be a certain age before the can check them out, preventing them from reading them	12
31406	4630	These are a few possabilities that could be used to keep offisive books out of childrens hands, and preventing them from reading those offensive books that you wouldn't want them getting a hold of and reading	13
31407	4631	Many people have different views on censorship	0
31408	4631	Some people believe there are movies, books, newspapers, etc that contain subject matter that is not appropriate for some viewers and that they should keep their writing on certain things to a certain extent or not at all	1
31409	4631	Other people believe people have the right to say what they want when they want, on a topic they believe the be true or not true, or very improtant to them, also called freedom of speech	2
31410	4631	Also people believe that yes, there are some things written out there that should not have been written but they have no control over and to some people it @MONTH1 be appropriate	3
31411	4631	I do believe there are stories written that are not appropriate	4
31412	4631	But I know that even though I find the subject to not be appropriate or of any use to me, another person will	5
31413	4631	I know that every person out there is different and has their own beliefs on different things	6
31414	4631	If people had the power to control what books, magazines, newspapers and movies were in libraries then @PERSON1 was right, 'We would have no books left on the shelf for any of us'	7
31415	4631	Certain books, newspapers, movies, and magazines could help certain people and be of interest to certain people no matter what the subject is or how inappropraite it @MONTH1 be as long as they are along the right age	8
31416	4631	If the story is plainly about drugs, sex, alcohol, and voilence with really no use to it, then yes I do believe it should be taken off the shelf	9
31417	4631	You do not know who could get their hands on that movie, book, or article	10
31418	4631	It could be a little kid and we do not want to open the door for that	11
31419	4631	People have many different beliefs and I do believe we should not take anything off the shelf that could be of use to anyone, but I also do believe there is a certain extent.	12
31420	4632	@CAPS1 happened to using books and films as simple entertainment	0
31421	4632	Why are we now cautious of @CAPS1 our children pick off the shelf	1
31422	4632	Society today has changed the way we once viewed our sources of entertainment	2
31423	4632	Books are now viewed with skepticism and once harmless movies and magazines are full of material no one should be reading or watching	3
31424	4632	Music used to be a beautiful form of art, but now when you turn on your radio, @CAPS1 do you hear	4
31425	4632	Mindless spewing of words linked together with curses and other garbage	5
31426	4632	Should libraries use caution when renting something to someone who shouldn't be using that material for harmless entertainment	6
31427	4632	There once was a young girl, fourteen or fifteen, who loved to read and listen to music	7
31428	4632	She was bright but shy, and used books as her friends	8
31429	4632	Each day she walked to the library for a new story to dive in	9
31430	4632	One day she came across a book on the top shelf of the fiction section	10
31431	4632	The book looked used, for its spine was badly split and several of the pages were nearly detached	11
31432	4632	She reached for the book, intrigued, and flipped through the pages	12
31433	4632	Her innocent and naive mind caught a hold of a world she didn't know	13
31434	4632	After reading the book, she was filled with guilt	14
31435	4632	It wasn't a good book, but a book that was laced with a harmful message	15
31436	4632	This young girl, once pure and simple, now knew things no one at that age should know	16
31437	4632	So, why wasn't there a warning of some sort	17
31438	4632	The difference between writing something offensive and being offensive is that the writer usually doesn't intend to be hurtful or rude	18
31439	4632	The author most likely intended for the peice of literature to be enjoyed with a clear and playful attitude	19
31440	4632	However the comparison between writing something offensive and being offensive is far different	20
31441	4632	When you read something in a book or magazine that disturbs you, put it down, or throw it away	21
31442	4632	No one is forcing you to read the material	22
31443	4632	Yet, the real question is	23
31444	4632	@CAPS1 about our children	24
31445	4632	How do we keep them safe from offensive literature	25
31446	4632	And @CAPS1 about music	26
31447	4632	Or movies	27
31448	4632	Remember the old black and white films	28
31449	4632	How, no matter @CAPS1 the plot or storyline is, the two leading roles somehow fall in love in the end	29
31450	4632	The ending title fills the screen just before the two actors share a kiss and then the screen goes black	30
31451	4632	Mind, there are still movies with happy endings and a positive message	31
31452	4632	@CAPS1 about the other films	32
31453	4632	Some of the biggest blockbusters are those which have either violence, some form or racism, and/or sexual content	33
31454	4632	Personally going to the movies to see a new action movie that looks thrilling and entertaining should be fun, but where does the fun stop	34
31455	4632	After the guy in the first scene has just been brutally murdered	35
31456	4632	Or after the two lovers share a special bond that should be kept private	36
31457	4632	And @CAPS1 happens when this movie is released and checked out from the library by a young boy who just wants a fun sleepover with his friends	37
31458	4632	How do we keep these sorts of material away from them	38
31459	4632	Libraries should use major caution when priting labels to place on their books, movies, magazines, etc	39
31460	4632	Librarians should make sure that the book a child hands to them is safe to read for that age level	40
31461	4632	Also, they should check the ratings on movies or make them not available to certain age group	41
31462	4632	Parents should also use caution when letting your child go to the movies with friends	42
31463	4632	Make sure they see something fun, but with a positive message	43
31464	4632	Should libraries take certain material off their shelves	44
31465	4632	I don't think so	45
31466	4632	However, be careful @CAPS1 you read or watch, for it might not please you	46
31467	4632	Use the internet as a source to find reviews on books and magazines, so see how well it was rated and then decide whether it is an intriguing read or an amazing film	47
31468	4632	Have fun, but be careful	48
31469	4634	I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive	0
31470	4634	First, you have to consider what is offensive to most people, and who should be the people to determine if it should be sensored or not	1
31471	4634	People should be able to decide for themselves if they can or cannot get an item off of a shelf, because they might not even consider it offensive	2
31472	4634	If you are a parent, you have the right to not let your children watch or read certain materials, but you can't get it taken off the shelf because then it prohibits other people from being able to get that same material that they think is acceptable	3
31473	4634	Things that are offensive range from cussing all the way to extreme violence	4
31474	4634	Some people @MONTH1 not mind that there are a couple of bad words or a little violence, but others will find it very offensive	5
31475	4634	In my personal experience, I tend not to think that a little cussing is offensive, but I do know some people who balk even hearing one minor cuss word	6
31476	4634	Many movies nowadays are made up of content that is mildly offensive, but only if you take it seriously	7
31477	4634	The movies make fun of things that people might find offensive, which probably offends those people even more, but they do not have to watch it if they don't want that movie	8
31478	4634	It just depends on the person and what they have grown up around, or what they think is right or wrong	9
31479	4634	It is either your own responsiblity or a parents responsibility to determine whether the content of a book or movie is appropriate	10
31480	4634	Many times parents use the argument that children are too young to make the judgement on a book or movie, and that is very true	11
31481	4634	So most children movies and books are appropriate, and do not include content that children are not quite ready to handle	12
31482	4634	If you are older, then you can probably make the decision to read or watch something because it is more appropriate for your age	13
31483	4634	Many times you have already been exposed to the ideas prevalent in books in movies because those things are already in your life	14
31484	4634	It comes down to who the movie is for and what content you think is appropriate for their age	15
31485	4634	The idea about taking these books off the shelves would be disastarous	16
31486	4634	The reading lists in schools would have to be cut down because parents didn't approve, and the children would lose valuable knowledge that is in most literature	17
31487	4634	One person could want to rent out their favorite horror movie and suddenly it would not be there because a couple of people thought it was offensive	18
31488	4634	There would be nothing left in libraries if one person did not approve of something because then every item would have at least one person disapprove.I once read To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, and our teacher told us that in another state this book had been banned because a couple of parents didn't like one or two things from the book	19
31489	4634	This book has many valuable ideas and lessons, and is considered a great piece of literature	20
31490	4634	These parents wanted the book to be banned from all schools, and all libraries all over the country, and that would be infringing on other people's rights of freedom of speech	21
31491	4634	The parents can say what they want about the book and not let their own child read it, but they cannot stop that opportunity for everyone else who wants to read the book	22
31492	4634	Taking it off the shelves would be taking off those ideas as well	23
31493	4634	Literature and every other movie and type of literature is what shapes a culture	24
31494	4634	There have been so many movements over time, many started with literature and it affected the culture and the people	25
31495	4634	Censorship would just take away a part of our culture, which would be devestating	26
31496	4634	You should look at your own life, and think about what you find offensive	27
31497	4634	Then step into someone else's shoes that does not think it is offensive, and see if it is worth it to take it all away from everyone	28
31498	4634	Almost everything could be considered offensive to at least one person, but it is your own resposiblity to decide whether it is appropriate for you or your child	29
31499	4634	The shelves should stay full of books, movies, music and magazines	30
31500	4634	It is our way of expressing freedom of speech, and that is an integral part of our country and our culture	31
31501	4635	Censorship in libraries is good in some ways	0
31502	4635	People who like to read books should have a wide variety of books	1
31503	4635	Things that offend people: for instance, a book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or natives and how they were treated so poorly	2
31504	4635	But almost anything now days offends peoaple and its rediculous	3
31505	4635	either way there is always going to be something that someone finds offensive	4
31506	4635	My expirience with this situation it really didn't bother me	5
31507	4635	But I was in a library glancing through a book and I read a paragragh and it had the word, 'nigger,' in it and I found it a little offinsive	6
31508	4635	That word just really isn't nice	7
31509	4635	People like different books movies magazines ect., and some of the greatest movies of all time, well im pretty sure some people find them offinsive in some way	8
31510	4635	What some might find offinsive, others might think different	9
31511	4635	Like in magazines my aunt finds them offinsive because of the bathing suit modles in it for addvertising a new swim suit	10
31512	4635	or for addvertising liquir	11
31513	4635	All together, just about everything is offinsive to somone out there	12
31514	4635	If all the things that people found offinsive was to be removed, then there would hardly be any books movies ect., and not only that it would suck all together	13
31515	4636	People should have a right to listen, read, and watch whatever they want	0
31516	4636	It is people's own choice to what they read, watch, or listen to	1
31517	4636	They will not be able to change that person by taking out offensive movies or books	2
31518	4636	They will only go somewhere else and do it	3
31519	4636	People have a right to read, listen to, and watch what they feel is good for them	4
31520	4636	If others find that offensive then that is their problem	5
31521	4636	People make their own decisions and that is their right	6
31522	4636	I feel that if you tell someone that they can not do a certain thing that will only make them want to do it more	7
31523	4636	Taking offensive books, music, movies, and magazines will not solve a problem that our society has with being offensive to others, it will only mask it	8
31524	4636	Taking them out will not all of a sudden make people stop being offensive to others, they just won't do it in libraries	9
31525	4636	Every book, music or movie will be offensive to some other person and if we take all the offensive stuff out there will be nothing left to read	10
31526	4636	It is just something that we will have to deal with	11
31527	4636	So I do not agree with censorship in libraries	12
31528	4636	It will only take away our right to read and view what we want but also it will take away all the offensive movies and books we have	13
31529	4636	which is almost every book	14
31530	4636	Everyone feels that one book or another if offensive to them and if we take away those books we will have nothing left in our libraries	15
31531	4637	censorship     No,i dont think they should take certin book off the shelves, there are alot of thing out there that can be found offensive	0
31532	4637	gangs, politics, race, even school that small children go to	1
31533	4637	I can understand wanting to shelter your children, but you cant keep them from every thing	2
31534	4637	Inner cities have gangs that right awfal words on trains, building, and about anything they possible can	3
31535	4637	an you cant just take that off the shelf	4
31536	4637	Politics can be the worst, during presidentual elections they are always bring up there color of skin, and about everything they can find out about the other person	5
31537	4637	All of your kids watch this on tv	6
31538	4637	Race wars can get bad, people all around the world are fighting just because the color of there skin	7
31539	4637	You cant him them from it either, its an on going battle that will never be one and it will keep getting worse	8
31540	4637	I cant speak for other schools but mine has a lot of little problems	9
31541	4637	little kids cussing, the older kids fighting, then there are the people that try to do good in school and get picked on for it	10
31542	4637	You cant hide you kids for ever, sooner or later they will find out about these problems	11
31543	4637	If you want to help your kids keep them off the streets because reading it in a book is alot better than them seeing it in the real world	12
31544	4637	You have to prepare them for the problems ahead, and if you dont then they might  get hurt alot worse than the little words in a book or a magazines or movies.	13
31545	4639	What is censorship	0
31546	4639	Many would say it's a book without cuss words or it's a movie without racism	1
31547	4639	For me, I think censorship is covering up the truth	2
31548	4639	I don't think movies or books should be taken off the self because some people find it offensive	3
31549	4639	When a book uses a cuss word to show anger or simply use the word, I think that it's okay because isn't that what we hear in the world already	4
31550	4639	Now I know some people @MONTH1 not have grown up hearing foul words but many of us have	5
31551	4639	With movies I think that if people have a problem with their children watching something bad or offensive then they shouldn't let their kid watch it	6
31552	4639	Thats whats wrong with people now a days, they don't want to take blame for things that go wrong in their lives	7
31553	4639	People use censorship as a way to make themselves feel like their a good parent or that the world owes them something	8
31554	4639	When it comes to someone thinking that a movie or book has gone to far with their race then censorship gets thrown around	9
31555	4639	Many people have issues with their race or nationality being messed with	10
31556	4639	Though it's funny to see that race use those foul words among themselves but when it's in a book it's racism	11
31557	4639	Or when a certain race is being made fun of or shown in a movie in a way that that race doesn't feel comfortable with, that movie is called racist	12
31558	4639	I feel that if people have an issue with something they don't agree with, then they should take it out of their own lives	13
31559	4639	Too many people try to control something, like cencorship	14
31560	4639	For years now people have wanted books that are read in school to be censored for bad language	15
31561	4639	Why put all that time toward the book being censored and not the school	16
31562	4639	I know kids in school use foul language all the time	17
31563	4639	Even worse then the books we read	18
31564	4639	If adults would realize it's their kids they need to censore and not the books then censorship wouldn't have become such a huge issue	19
31565	4639	People need to just realize that by cencoring the books or movies doesn't make the offencive words or bad images go away, it just covers them up	20
31566	4640	Taking books off a shelf at libraries because someone thinks they are offensive	0
31567	4640	I dont think that is right	1
31568	4640	Thats just what one person thinks and other people I'm sure won't think the same way	2
31569	4640	Just because one person think something is offensive and should be taken off that shelf doesn't mean that some kid couldn't learn from that book	3
31570	4640	Also with music, movies, and magazines, well that you can get that everywhere else so why is it such a bad thing to have it a library	4
31571	4640	A lot of kids go to libraries to find books they need for school and if people are taking books off the shelf that they need, then how are they supposed to get their work done	5
31572	4640	Im sure there are people out there that would say the books they need are something they shouldn't be leaning yet, but we are going to have to learn about it sometime, so why not now	6
31573	4640	Taking away music	7
31574	4640	kids can just get on the internet and get that just as easy and most kids are doing it in ways that could get them in trouble	8
31575	4640	So having music at libraries is just giving them a free way to get it	9
31576	4640	Magazines you could just go to a store and get but a lot of kids probably don't have the money to buy them so having them at a libraries would give them a way to be able to see them	10
31577	4640	As long as it is stuff that kids can see then i don't see what is wrong with libraries having them there	11
31578	4640	So i think taking books, music, magazies, and movies away form libraries isn't a very good thing to do	12
31579	4640	Maybe they could make an adult area and if someone tells them they think a book should go in there then they can look over it and see if it should	13
31580	4640	I can see some stuff getting taken away but not very much and if you take all that away from a library then you dont really have much of a library anymore.	14
31581	4641	I think if its offensive it should not be avavible for kids intill they are old enough to read it, listen to it	0
31582	4641	I think they need to be removed from shelves or put away	1
31583	4641	Because it can be hurtful, dirty for younger kids and it could be prevented if they are removed from shelves	2
31584	4641	I belive the magazines can be put away or put into its own sections	3
31585	4641	Music or movies could be put in there own sections also	4
31586	4641	Internet could be blocked for certain websites	5
31587	4641	Luckly the time we live in has people to prevent these things to happen like adults	6
31588	4641	And people to watch you and can tell you you are too young for that stuff	7
31589	4641	This is what I think it could be easily prevent just put them up or removed and taken off shelves	8
31590	4641	If they are offensive remove them so we dont have to worry if are children are reading them or not.	9
31591	4642	Dear Newspaper,     I would like to start off by sayin that books, music, movies, magazines, etc	0
31592	4642	are great for kids in libraries	1
31593	4642	It's great that kids have a place to go in there free time when they have nothing else to do or need a place to read	2
31594	4642	But some things are not suitable for young kids and young adults	3
31595	4642	In high school just walking down the hall you will find out more things than you would probably like to know	4
31596	4642	Many of them @MONTH1 not be appropriate but whenever you walk into the library its almost as if they are promoting drugs, alcohol, and sex	5
31597	4642	Books about drugs are okay to a certain extent, like if they are medicinal drugs	6
31598	4642	But whenever they are talking about how drugs take the pain away and make everything better, thats when its taken to far	7
31599	4642	Our kids and future kids do not need to be learning about these sort of things	8
31600	4642	Alcohol is the same way	9
31601	4642	You see alcohol everywhere and kids are doing it at a young age because movies, music, books, etc	10
31602	4642	are promoting it basically	11
31603	4642	Our kids do not need to be learning about these sorts of things	12
31604	4642	We need them to learn about the dangers of alcohol, not how to get drunk and what you do when your drunk	13
31605	4642	Advertsements are the worst things that kids could be seeing especially when they are on billbords, fronts of magazines, etc	14
31606	4642	Kids do not need to be learning these things at such a young age	15
31607	4642	Kids should be persuaded to play outside and be in sports and have fun with the family or ride there bike	16
31608	4642	I feel that these things should be taken out of libraries if they are offensive to some people	17
31609	4642	Because maybe its for the best that these things are taken off shelves beacuse maybe our kids will be healthier and live longer without being influenced or under pressure about doing drugs and alcohol, etc	18
31610	4642	Sincerely,                                                           @PERSON1	19
31611	4643	I am sending this letter to you about my views on censorship in libraries	0
31612	4643	Some people think books, music, movies, magazines,etc., are offensive	1
31613	4643	Those things might be offensive to them, but not to other people	2
31614	4643	So you have to look at it in not only your point of view but other people point of view	3
31615	4643	I think they should not remove these things from the shelves	4
31616	4643	Everyone has a different point of view like my mom for instence she likes vampire books and movies, but i like tragedy	5
31617	4643	See everyone likes something different	6
31618	4643	They also have to think to the books we have from @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM2, etc., are offensive to some people	7
31619	4643	Are we going to take those books out to	8
31620	4643	I mean if we took books, music, movies, magazines, etc., out for being offensive then we would not have any books, music, movies, magazines, etc	9
31621	4643	Everyone thinks something offensive, some might think the same thing is offensive some might thing something different is offenseive	10
31622	4643	We should not take books, music, movies, magazines, etc., off the shevles	11
31623	4643	I understand that people do not want there kids to see them or hear them	12
31624	4643	It part of life though	13
31625	4643	You can not take everything out to please one person, because it could make another person mad	14
31626	4645	People find things offensive everyday	0
31627	4645	It is just a matter of life	1
31628	4645	Some people have a right to feel offended for some reasons, but they really can't control it from happening	2
31629	4645	It is just something that has occured for thousands of years	3
31630	4645	And people have slowly began to deal with it	4
31631	4645	So therefore, i believe that books and other materials that are found offensive should not have to be taken down because it offends someone, because taking it down could offend someone else	5
31632	4645	What i'm really trying to get across is that no matter what, not everyone will be happy	6
31633	4645	Life is filled with mixed society and emotions, so not everyone will agree on the same thing	7
31634	4645	Also it should be up to the library whether or not they want to remove some of their material	8
31635	4645	Because they did pay for it and have a right to let people in society watch, read, or listen to it	9
31636	4645	Thus being said, i believe that they should try to keep certain offensive material to a minimum	10
31637	4645	Such as racism, it seems as though rasicm impacts alot of the country still today	11
31638	4645	And will forever be an on growing matter in problems around the @CAPS1	12
31639	4645	In conclusion, i believe that the library has a right to own books or movies that are somewhat offensive	13
31640	4645	Because like i said everyone deals with it at one point, and not everyone can be happy	14
31641	4645	And some of the material is most likely educational and teaches us about the history of the @LOCATION1,@CAPS1, ect, rather than being racist or offensive as everyone jumps to conclusions about	15
31642	4645	And everyone needs to get past the offensive side and get to a level where everyone sees eye to eye	16
31643	4645	For we are all the same, but yet, still broken up among looks and culture	17
31644	4647	Should certain books, movies, and magazines be removed from library bookshelves if found offensive	0
31645	4647	I believe that libraries should remove materials that are offensive	1
31646	4647	Libraries are huge public places that share knowledge and entertainment to enormous groups of people who want to expand their knowledge	2
31647	4647	Throughout the @LOCATION1 and other countries there are libraries that hold offensive material	3
31648	4647	Now I strongly believe in throwing out these offensive items because little children could grab one in their hands, there could be people that can be influenced to do stupid activities that they have learned, and some people might steal these items for themselves	4
31649	4647	Libraries are important resources that tons of different groups of people come to enjoy, relax, and think	5
31650	4647	Now all over the countries libraries have offensive material that should be romoved from their shelves	6
31651	4647	Little children and their parents come to the library because a library is a great way to relieve stress and to let children learn	7
31652	4647	Say there are materials that are not suitable for children so they grab it and started reading	8
31653	4647	Next thing you know your children will have that type of knowlegde and you can't do a thing about it	9
31654	4647	Offensive material are around little kids and parent don't even know	10
31655	4647	They could gain offensive language or talk about it at school and that material could spread	11
31656	4647	Material like that at the library can harm children brains by brainwashing them	12
31657	4647	Teenagers are becoming of age to where they might do something regretable	13
31658	4647	Teen often go to the library to meet up with friends, or start on homework	14
31659	4647	Then a person who is inmature spots a book and begins to read	15
31660	4647	After that he or she thought that it was extremely funny and wants to try it at home, but then gets badly hurt	16
31661	4647	Teens can be influenced by anything and what's worse is that it can start at the library	17
31662	4647	Then there are people who just come into a library and steal the offensive material for themselves	18
31663	4647	People like that are inmature and could serve a real problem for the library	19
31664	4647	Once having that item in their grasp	20
31665	4647	they could post it on the internet and show the whole world what he or she found	21
31666	4647	Offensive material could be easily stoten from a library	22
31667	4647	if these certain items were not at the library then rebels wouldn't be stealing anything from the library	23
31668	4647	Libraries are for different people who want to learn and teach others about their newly obtained knowledge	24
31669	4647	Libraries have the absolute best resources a place could have or ever wanted	25
31670	4647	I don't want such a wonderful resource be tainted by these obsence materials	26
31671	4647	That is why I strongly believe that certain material  such as books, magazines, movies, and music that are offensive should be removed from libraries.	27
31672	4648	Some people believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
31673	4648	However, I do not believe they should be removed	1
31674	4648	People are mature enough to be able to handle offensive material	2
31675	4648	Most people check out books or movies that they have heard about, so for the most part they know what they are reading @MONTH1 be offensive	3
31676	4648	Instead of removing the ofensive material, there should just be a warning to let readers know that what they are checking out is considered offensive	4
31677	4648	These days, people are mature enough to read offensive material	5
31678	4648	We see many types of offensive material every day	6
31679	4648	Examples of this inlcude when we watch the news, we @MONTH1 see numerous offensive pictures or videos	7
31680	4648	There are also many news stories that many people consider offensive	8
31681	4648	When a person checks out an offensive book, they are doing so because they want to	9
31682	4648	Libraries should not revoke a reader's right to read what he/she wants	10
31683	4648	Before a person checks out a book or movie, they should look into it to make sure they are okay with what they are getting	11
31684	4648	This can prevent many problems	12
31685	4648	For example, say a young reader sees a book that they think looks interesting	13
31686	4648	If they don't read into it a little bit and just take it home, they @MONTH1 later find that it contains offensive material	14
31687	4648	However, if they read a little bit about it before they check it out, they will find out it contains offensive material, and can then make the decision on whether or not they still want to read it	15
31688	4648	There are many ways libraries can prevent children or other people not mature enough to view the offensive material from seeing it	16
31689	4648	They can put a warning label on the book or movie to inform people that that particular item is considered offensive	17
31690	4648	Libraries could even put an age limit on checking out offensive material	18
31691	4648	Either of these ideas could be an efffective way to ensure that only mature people are checking out anything that is considered to be ofensive	19
31692	4648	Libraries should not have to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc	20
31693	4648	that contain offensive material from the shelves	21
31694	4648	If a person wants to check out a book that is offensive, they should be allowed to check it out and read it	22
31695	4648	Also, people should be intelligent enough to look into whatever item they are checking out before hand so they can be aware of the offensive material	23
31696	4648	However, to make things even easier, libraries could just put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it.	24
31697	4649	Censorship in libraries today, I believe, are not a big problem	0
31698	4649	But many would disagree with that	1
31699	4649	Books and movies can be a very important resource for anyone of any age	2
31700	4649	They can gives us facts about a certain topic that we @MONTH1 not find any where else	3
31701	4649	Everyone has thier own definition of offensive	4
31702	4649	I belive that it is not only up to the library to rate the books, movies, and magazines offensive but it is also up to the participants using these resources	5
31703	4649	For many kids, no matter what age, they only rent books from a library for two main reasons: pleasure and projects	6
31704	4649	To sensor a book from a teenager or child is just like more of an invitation to see whats inside of it	7
31705	4649	For the people who do pleasure reading they most of the time stick to only one type of genre	8
31706	4649	If someone wanted to rent a book, and it was not appropriate for them to read, then the librarian or teacher would restrict that book from them	9
31707	4649	For projects, such as for school, it would depend upon the librarian to censor the book to a child	10
31708	4649	But books are not rated such as movies are	11
31709	4649	So it really all depends upon the use of the book and the maturity of the person who is renting it	12
31710	4649	If they feel that it will not be appropriate for some, then they could give a suggestion to censor it	13
31711	4649	Movies and books are different in many ways	14
31712	4649	Books allow you to create a mental description and picture in your mind for what you are reading	15
31713	4649	Movies, on the other hand, create a visual image right in front of your eyes	16
31714	4649	No matter how gruesome or vile of a description a book can give, it still does not compare with the visual picture of a video	17
31715	4649	Movies are rated today as to the age of a person, and they say why they are rated as such	18
31716	4649	Movies rated above the @NUM1 level are most of the time not held in libraries	19
31717	4649	They @MONTH1 still be censored if they create too vile of an image, but that is up to the one who watches it	20
31718	4649	Music is a major part of each one of our lives, and without it the world would be a much different place	21
31719	4649	Everyone finds themselves quite fond of a certain genre of music, and most of the time sticks to it	22
31720	4649	Music, like movies, is also rated by the content of the song	23
31721	4649	If it has a word or two that should be sensored, then it is most likely already labeled 'explicit'	24
31722	4649	I think that music, just like movies, should not be able to be censored, because they are already rated accordingly	25
31723	4649	Some books, magazines, and movies contain cold hard facts about the past years of our world and are too vile for anyone	26
31724	4649	And even though those events are in our past they are still very important to our present	27
31725	4649	Books can be a magical place for children, as well as adults, to go and create their own world	28
31726	4649	To censor a book, movie, or magazine would be taking away that chance for someone to enjoy life just a little bit more for that small moment in time.	29
31727	4650	My opinion on this subject is its not right	0
31728	4650	This is a very interesting question	1
31729	4650	And im going to tell you why i think the way i do	2
31730	4650	Im for it and against it	3
31731	4650	Okay some people like different things and the other people dont agree on it	4
31732	4650	Thats how things work	5
31733	4650	If a parent is walking his kid through the mall and goes into a music store and hears the music cussing in it i would not want my kid to be around that and thats what it means by removing something like that because somebody is offened	6
31734	4650	I totally agree on that	7
31735	4650	Like ciggerettes	8
31736	4650	Kids walk in to go buy candy then they go to pay for it and the back wall is full of tobacco products that the kids can see	9
31737	4650	Once again i would want to remove that from the shelfs	10
31738	4650	There would be so many conflicts if this happened	11
31739	4650	Everyone likes different things	12
31740	4650	So i think everyone is going to get offened by taking things away that looks offensive towards them	13
31741	4650	This goes from kids to adults	14
31742	4650	Every age would be bothered by this	15
31743	4650	Now this is my against veiw on this subject	16
31744	4650	This would make me very mad if i admired something a lot and then come to find out that someone is offened by it so they take it away from the people and that like that object	17
31745	4650	All this would do is cause problems for everybody and just make everything go bad	18
31746	4650	Thats how its suppost to be	19
31747	4650	We all have are opinions	20
31748	4650	We all like different things	21
31749	4650	We all have to get over it if we dont like it or dont get along with it	22
31750	4650	Thats something we have to take in and suck it up	23
31751	4650	So on this subject im for both	24
31752	4650	I see it both ways because its good and bad	25
31753	4650	People are just going to have to get over the fact that they have to deal with what they see or hear	26
31754	4650	Its part of life.	27
31755	4651	I believe that certain materials should not be removed if they are found innapropriate	0
31756	4651	There are several things that explain why I think this	1
31757	4651	For one thing, some libraries don't have certain genres of books	2
31758	4651	For example, say one library @MONTH1 have action but not thriller while another library has thriller but not action	3
31759	4651	If some materials were removed from public libraries due to censorship, people would only be able to find it online or in certain stores	4
31760	4651	Second reason being that kids would not get into these kind of books if it was innapropriate, unless they're given approval by parents	5
31761	4651	If these materials were to still be on shelves, you should at least be a certain age to read it, unless the parents make it to where their kids don't have to get approval from them first	6
31762	4651	Sure it would make the library more kid-friendly, but a book shouldn't be kept away from a kid only because of a few bad words	7
31763	4651	Lastly, some adults would be upset of the removal of some books	8
31764	4651	Some books that are intended would be better off staying in the library	9
31765	4651	If they were to remove these books, adults would then have to find a book online	10
31766	4651	So censorship, to me, is not going to make any difference	11
31767	4651	If this continues, it @MONTH1 lead so far, that the libraries would have to be closed	12
31768	4651	Take my word for it	13
31769	4651	In conclusion, don't let censorship take over our libraries.	14
31770	4652	Censorship to most people means much more than the average @NUM1 syllable word	0
31771	4652	It means giving up the right to say and think however you want	1
31772	4652	To most, this idea is not a good one	2
31773	4652	When one is censored, they are essentially giving up the right of freedom of @CAPS3	3
31774	4652	In this essay I will discuss three cons of censorship in libraries	4
31775	4652	One reason censorship should not be aloud in libraries is the lack of freedom of @CAPS3	5
31776	4652	Decades ago when it was set into place that anyone was aloud to practice their right to speak freely, the idea of censorship was not in the plan	6
31777	4652	As @CAPS1's, it is our right to speak and write however we want without reprocussions, however offensive or non-offensive the material @MONTH1 be	7
31778	4652	As @CAPS1's all should realize that everyone is different and not everyone will agree with one another	8
31779	4652	Does that mean that just because one person finds something offensive, then an item should be taken off shelves	9
31780	4652	Absolutley not	10
31781	4652	Freedom of @CAPS3 is our birth right and we should be aloud to say or write anything without being censored	11
31782	4652	'...But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	12
31783	4652	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson	13
31784	4652	Author Katherine Paterson simply states that if she has the right to take any book of the shelf that she doesn't like, then everyone else also has that same right	14
31785	4652	As previously stated in the paragraph above, it makes no sense to rid a book just because one person finds it offensive	15
31786	4652	If that was the case, I could find @NUM2 books in our library that I find offensive, and the next person could find @NUM3 books that are offensive and so on	16
31787	4652	Just as Katherine states, 'And then we have no books left on the shelves for any of us.'     And the last con of censorship in libraries is the lack of perspective and learning a book brings	17
31788	4652	As an avid book reader, I couldn't even begin to describe all of the vocabulary words and new things I learn from reading one book	18
31789	4652	Just recently I read the book @CAPS4 @CAPS5	19
31790	4652	As I was reading, I began to have a deep hatred of the main character	20
31791	4652	Later I found that the book was incredibly offensive	21
31792	4652	However, from reading it, the book provided much insight into @DATE1's life that I new nothing about	22
31793	4652	It gave me a great deal of information that to this day, I use	23
31794	4652	The book made me reflect on myself and how @NUM4 plus years changes people, @CAPS1's more specifically	24
31795	4652	In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not a good idea	25
31796	4652	When one is censored they give up their right of freedom of @CAPS3, other books in general, and loss of oppotunity to learn new things	26
31797	4652	Hopefully with this essay, I have persuaded you or at least informed you on the cons of censorship in libraries	27
31798	4653	Is there enough censorship in our libraries	0
31799	4653	Have you ever came across a vulgar or offensive book in your library and hoped that no children had ever read it	1
31800	4653	Well that should never happen,  if a book or any other material is offensive then it should be put in a seperate area of the library where only adults can access it	2
31801	4653	Other than that section their should not be any offensive or vulgar materials that children or even early teenagers should be able to see	3
31802	4653	Almost everyday children and teenagers have access to offensive and vulgar materials that could have terrible effects on them	4
31803	4653	Maybe if they do not see these offensive materials when they are young they will be less likely to use or engage in some of the things that they see or read	5
31804	4653	For example when teenagers read about people doing drugs that could influence them to engage in those type of activities as well	6
31805	4653	The materials might not have an effect right away but later on down the road it could have a giant effect on them	7
31806	4653	The youth is what is going to be running this country when we are old	8
31807	4653	So we need to do our part and take offensive and vulgar materials out of the reach of our children and teenagers	9
31808	4653	I do not want my children to read some of the things that I read when I was young	10
31809	4653	That is why I believe their should be censorship in every library.	11
31810	4654	BooksI think that every book in the world should be on the shelf	0
31811	4654	because if it is afencive then dont read it	1
31812	4654	it is alot beter if u can go read eny book u wat to	2
31813	4654	and if thy dont have that book then i gess u gota go get it somwere else and some people wouldnt go thrue all that trouble for a book	3
31814	4654	Wich means they wont know as much as they wanted to or could known	4
31815	4654	we need smat people to know as much as there potential and as they wat and can posibly know	5
31816	4654	But books are books not every body reads alot of books	6
31817	4654	lets say u wanted to know somthin about a truck wat do u do u go find a book about it or get online or ask sombody that knows	7
31818	4654	How would enybody know enything about it if the person that bilt the truck didnt write a book telling u about the truck	8
31819	4654	You would haft to take it apart and find out your self wich isn't verry easy at all	9
31820	4654	and if u mest up thats not good	10
31821	4654	but if u had a book to go bye it makes thing alot simpler most of the time	11
31822	4654	This is one of the reasons every book should be on the shelf	12
31823	4654	so that if u need to know somthing and u want to learn u can read about it	13
31824	4654	And find out wat u want to know	14
31825	4654	Reading is one of the best ways to find out wat u are looking for so that way nobody is telling u wrong	15
31826	4654	Plus books are just good to read                                             Movies      all movies should be there to because every bodie has the right to wach eny movie they want	16
31827	4654	Inles they arnt of age	17
31828	4654	and if no parent haft to say its ok for them to wach it	18
31829	4654	If it afends u dont wach it	19
31830	4654	Magizines          @CAPS1 are good to i read alot of magizins u can find alot about enything in a magizine	20
31831	4654	so ya the are good	21
31832	4655	Do I believe that certain materials, suchs as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed for being offensive	0
31833	4655	No I do not	1
31834	4655	My opinion on the varieties of things found in our library are good	2
31835	4655	Most of it is very helpful information	3
31836	4655	Some people might not like some things because of what they have in it or on them, but most of it is history	4
31837	4655	You can't change that	5
31838	4655	If someone doesn't like a book, movie, or magaine, they shouldn't read it	6
31839	4655	I have found the things in our libraries to really help on a lot of projects	7
31840	4655	If we need to know about slaves or slavery, we can go to our library	8
31841	4655	Some peoples views on that is totally different, but hey	9
31842	4655	We can't help what people did in the past	10
31843	4655	We can only learn from their mistakes	11
31844	4655	I say if you don't like what you see on the front of the cover, don't read it	12
31845	4655	Look for something else more interesting to you	13
31846	4655	I have not found one thing in our library offensive to me	14
31847	4655	Or even bad	15
31848	4655	They have books over everything	16
31849	4655	Some of it can be bad, but mostly it all is good information	17
31850	4655	They talk about history, and guns and drugs, and wars and all sorts of other history information	18
31851	4655	There are books over stuff that isn't even true	19
31852	4655	I think people @MONTH1 over react on some things	20
31853	4655	If you don't like a book or movie, don't get it	21
31854	4655	Look at the cover and if it seems appealing, get it	22
31855	4655	But if not, don't waste time on complaining about it	23
31856	4655	Because then things can get out of control	24
31857	4655	That is my opinion on books, movies, magazines, etc in our libraries	25
31858	4655	Mainly they seem very helpful, but others can have different opinions	26
31859	4656	I think there should be no books taken off the shelfs	0
31860	4656	Somethings might be offisive to some people but other people might need those books for a research, projects,etc	1
31861	4656	People need to read to understand why some people think that somethings are offensive toward other people	2
31862	4656	Every book should be on a book shelf in a public library	3
31863	4656	Everybody has the freedom to choose for thier self, let them decide if it is offensive to them and others	4
31864	4656	Maybe an author wrote a book about gansters, and their kids	5
31865	4656	Maybe the author wrote the book to give you an inside look on somebody's life	6
31866	4656	We live in a very diverse world they are going to be different outlooks on the world	7
31867	4656	The author could be writing the book to show you what that child went throught during that point of life with killings, and violence	8
31868	4656	That should not be offensive to somebody because they are talking about killings and violence	9
31869	4656	Reading that book should let you see how that child grew up	10
31870	4656	The book could even change some of the childs parents who are in gangs their minds	11
31871	4656	It could let them realize how it will have an effect on their childs life later on in life	12
31872	4656	I believe the same thing goes for movies and magazines	13
31873	4656	Through reading the magazines and watching movies it could help you	14
31874	4656	Say if you are in a gang and you watch movies and read you would find out what happens to the gang, it could change your thoughts	15
31875	4656	These books, movies, magazines could show what is going to happen to you	16
31876	4656	Maybe directiors/ writers do these types ot thngs to show you what will happen to you if you continue down the path in gangs and harmful clubs	17
31877	4656	Why should certain people get to choose if a book, moive, magazine,etc is offensive to some people but not others	18
31878	4656	I think the only way to fix it is to leave every book on public library shelfs	19
31879	4656	Let the peple who come to the library to read books decide what is right or offensive for them to read	20
31880	4656	Even if library's make a decision somebody is going to get mad and upset	21
31881	4656	I do not think there is any way to solve an issue like this except letting people read and decided for themself	22
31882	4656	If they like the book great, if not then  do not read it again or return the book.Nobody can decide right from wrong for somebody, only you can do it for your self.	23
31883	4658	Hello @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to talk about censorship in libraries	0
31884	4658	In libraries they have tons of materials that have language and images that are offensive	1
31885	4658	i have a broad view on this subject	2
31886	4658	My view is just that if the censor stuff in a library, the should censor tv	3
31887	4658	I have deaf parents, so we always have the captions on in our house	4
31888	4658	Everyday I see bad language thats inot censored	5
31889	4658	I also have seen images that are not censored	6
31890	4658	The youth of this time mostly watch tv than use the library	7
31891	4658	So why not censor tv	8
31892	4658	I see things on tv that i wont see in a library	9
31893	4658	In my conclusion i would like to say i dont believe that libraries should censor their materials because the studdent will still find out	10
31894	4658	There are plenty of other places that are worse	11
31895	4658	Like crimes scenes, cime scens have blood and gore and a library would just have language	12
31896	4658	These are my views ancd yours could be differnt.	13
31897	4659	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	0
31898	4659	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson, an author, once said	1
31899	4659	I think that she was trying to tell us that some books should not be out on the shelves for children to read	2
31900	4659	I agree with her on that statement	3
31901	4659	I have once read a book with very mature content	4
31902	4659	It was very vulgar and not sutable for my age or maturity	5
31903	4659	There are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society	6
31904	4659	They are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as: war, violence, sex, drugs, and all sorts of other things	7
31905	4659	If we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives	8
31906	4659	There would be less teen pregancies, drug ussage, and multiple other factors that are effecting our society	9
31907	4659	Children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media	10
31908	4659	I think that we shouldn't get rid of these book though	11
31909	4659	We should just keep them out of the libraries	12
31910	4659	If people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere	13
31911	4659	An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of this content and to put them in a separate store or section in the libraries	14
31912	4659	A very great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media	15
31913	4659	But she also said that the people who read or watch this type of media have every right to	16
31914	4659	This is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media	17
31915	4659	But for now if the content is to adult for you or does not agree with you, don't read or watch it.	18
31916	4660	We have all been to a library at some point in our life	0
31917	4660	Have you ever been looking around and seen something that @MONTH1 have been offensive, or something you didnt agree with	1
31918	4660	What if you had the chance to have if takin off the shelves for good	2
31919	4660	Or, what if someone else had the choice to	3
31920	4660	Would you allow them to do so	4
31921	4660	In my opinion, I would say no	5
31922	4660	Someone does not have the right to take reading material off the shelves, just because it @MONTH1 be offensive to them, or there way of life	6
31923	4660	I say, if you do not like it, do not look at it, it is simple as that	7
31924	4660	For example, what if you were into rap, or the hip hop culture, and someone finds that offensive	8
31925	4660	Would you give them the right to keep it from you	9
31926	4660	Or, would you really want to do that to someone else	10
31927	4660	Lets say you are a christian, and an atheist finds the @CAPS1 offence, or untruthfull, so he has it takin off the shelves	11
31928	4660	Does that sound fair to you	12
31929	4660	If someone was to not like a certain topic or culture, or finds it offensive, all they would have to do, is simply stay away from it	13
31930	4660	The point is, if we all were to take something off the shelves, there would adventually be nothing left	14
31931	4660	Respect what other cultures and ways of life do, and stay away from what offends you	15
31932	4660	Would you like someone to have what you like takin off the shelves	16
31933	4660	I would not, so you should not do that to other people.	17
31934	4661	It seems today we attempt to censor everything, but are we going too far	0
31935	4661	Could it be that we have crossed the line and are no longer protecting the children, but are instead holding back our society as a whole	1
31936	4661	In my opinion, censorship of literature has crossed the line	2
31937	4661	A library is, essentially, an incredably valuable resource to each generation	3
31938	4661	In some cases it still is, but when books are being with held do to the fact that it @MONTH1 offend someone we are holding people back from the knowledge they could gain from the work of literature itself	4
31939	4661	We attempt to placate everyone in today's society, therefore we censor several things that are not politically correct	5
31940	4661	If future generations are unable to learn what we have through these writings, then they will lack the insight we had gained	6
31941	4661	Another reason is, to be perfectly honest, history and society have not- and very well @MONTH1 never truly be- politically correct	7
31942	4661	People take umbrage to certain words and consequently some libraries will remove the book featuring said words from their shelves	8
31943	4661	After this is done, what have we really accomplished	9
31944	4661	Have we made the world a better place by attempting to hide a part of history	10
31945	4661	That is debatable, but by the same token, in school we must learn about the @CAPS1 despite the fact that it upsets many people	11
31946	4661	We must learn about this because it was an important part in history that needs to be remembered in hopes that nothing so terrible as that will ever happen again	12
31947	4661	So, if we learn about an entire subject which happened in another country but effected the entire world should we not learn about our own faults in history	13
31948	4661	The times we have oppressed people, the terms we used so commonly we attempt to hide now	14
31949	4661	Has it really helped us	15
31950	4661	No, for until people recognize a problem and furthermore are reminded of how wrong it was they will not understand it	16
31951	4661	Napoleon once said that history is a story written by the victor, but is victory so sweet after our history has been rewritten	17
31952	4661	If everything that offends people is censored or taken away we will have nothing left	18
31953	4661	For if one person is aloud to say what is and isn't acceptable then others will partake in this as well	19
31954	4661	It would become a new fad and people would find a problem with just about anything	20
31955	4661	So, essentially, by censoring works in libraries we are holding back the future generations from all that they could be	21
31956	4661	We are forcing them to be ignorant of society's problems	22
31957	4661	In the end we must ask ourselves, was it really worth it	23
31958	4661	I remind you, a library is an invaluable resource.	24
31959	4662	When people think of a library they think of a quiet place to study and read	0
31960	4662	Teachers use the libraries for many different things	1
31961	4662	One thing they use it for is movies on certain topics	2
31962	4662	Another is for books on certain people or events	3
31963	4662	They even use it to get magazines for projects and to catch up on the world outside of school	4
31964	4662	So what is my opinion on offensive materials getting removed	5
31965	4662	I'll tell you what it is	6
31966	4662	Kids watch movies in class all the time	7
31967	4662	Some are not appropriate at times, but some are very insiteful and helpful	8
31968	4662	I think if the teacher watches the movie first and thinks that it is too bad for children in say elementary it should be banned from that schools library, but for high schoolers chances are they have heard or seen worse	9
31969	4662	So with saying that movies should stay in the libraries of high schools but not all should stay in the elementary's	10
31970	4662	Books are another good resource if used correctly	11
31971	4662	They help kids in history learn about old war hero's and past events	12
31972	4662	Some books should be kept behind the counter and only used for certain classes though	13
31973	4662	Like for instance books that tell specifics about drugs	14
31974	4662	They should be taken off the shelves , put behind the counter	15
31975	4662	and if someone really needs a book about them like for medicine purposes to become a doctor then all they have to do is ask	16
31976	4662	Magazines are good for a couple of different nice things	17
31977	4662	One thing is projects	18
31978	4662	If you have to do a project over something like food and cant use a computer, magazines are a great way to get good pictures	19
31979	4662	Another thing its commonly used for is just flat out entertainment	20
31980	4662	Like when you get bored of reading a book that you just picked out because of looks or if a book is too hard to read you could get a magazine	21
31981	4662	So in reality some things should be kept and others taken away	22
31982	4662	People spend lots of time in the library for many different things and that will never change	23
31983	4662	Movies are a good source of entertainment and that won't change either	24
31984	4662	So I guess i'm half and half on keeping or getting rid of offensive materials.	25
31985	4663	My view opposes the open distribution of certain newspaper articles	0
31986	4663	There are certain articles, radio shows, and other sources of media that vividly describe certain things that happen in the news that I find not to be appropriate for some people to hear such as younger children, or people that don't agree with having to listen to things such as: bias reactions, opinions, and interpretations of these things	1
31987	4663	Open distribution of newspaper articles and things containing disturbing images ought to be censored	2
31988	4663	I recently seen photos of people who have been killed in the process of finding @LOCATION1	3
31989	4663	I find that these images @MONTH1 serve some importance to people interested, but for children who can look on their doorstep and look at the newspaper, can see horrifying images that some people @MONTH1 think they shouldn't be exposed to	4
31990	4663	Even as adults people don't necessarily agree with it	5
31991	4663	Adults @MONTH1 see what's in the news and @MONTH1 find it to be intriguing as it pertains to them or fairly disturbing, but as far as the protection and limited exposure their children @MONTH1 have, it @MONTH1 not be such a good thing for their kids to be hearing	6
31992	4663	I was in the car heading back from school one day, and my dad had just picked me up from school, and I casually switch the raido from am to fm as I always do when I get in the car, but I didn't hear the sudden outbreak of a top one hundred song as I had expected, I heard a woman asserting her opinion about the death of @LOCATION1 to a talk radio show host	7
31993	4663	The show had previously been recorded, and so after the woman had lashed out for being so angry about the whole thing, there was a review of other calls that other people had made in mad frustration about the womans' comments	8
31994	4663	She had said earlier that it was wrong to have killed somebody, in which the talk radio show host responded with the argument that it was okay for @LOCATION1 to kill thousands, but we can't kill him argument	9
31995	4663	The reviews that the other callers had made sort of disturbed me	10
31996	4663	The things that the callers were saying were very offensive towards the woman who had expressed her feelings	11
31997	4663	The other callers were saying that she needed to get out of our country, and were cursing at her	12
31998	4663	News like the death of @LOCATION1 isn't just violent in itself, but creates reactions that are very violent as well	13
31999	4663	Another instance when I was exposed to some information that @MONTH1 not have been well accepted by others was when we were having an assembly meeting at my school, and we watched a video about a protest that was against people of @CAPS1 belief	14
32000	4663	The whole problem with the protest was that the people of the @CAPS1 faith were born in @LOCATION3, and were meeting with representatives in order to help a poor community in @LOCATION2	15
32001	4663	Although they were making an effort to help the poor communities, and homeless people in @LOCATION2 there were people shouting at the im protest to leave, and to go back to where they came from	16
32002	4663	When people hear things about this in the news it can be very offensive, because although it @MONTH1 be happening on a complete opposite coast, it would be able to effect someone, it can easily effect someone who doesn't understand previous conflicts that would shape these peoples' opinions and @MONTH1 take that very offensively, because it is a very complex matter even though it is still very wrong	17
32003	4663	I believe that the material that is being exposed to people of all ages should be censored, because the material that is being openly distributed now isn't necessarily suitable for everyone, and some people @MONTH1 not want to hear about it, and want to avoid the news that is going around about certain topics that they @MONTH1 not be comfortable with	18
32004	4664	I think that if a book can be published then it should be able to be in a library	0
32005	4664	If a book is published then it means it's open to the public so I don't see why it can't be in the libraries	1
32006	4664	If a book has to be removed from a library then why did they buy it	2
32007	4664	I really don't see the need to take a book off the shelf in a library	3
32008	4664	If someone dosen't like it then they don't have to get it	4
32009	4664	I beleive that only the owner of the library should be the only one to take a book off a shelf because it is their own store, but why would they waste the money in buying the book	5
32010	4664	The public shouldn't be able to remove books from libraries because not everyone likes the same kind of books	6
32011	4664	Everyone has different views also	7
32012	4664	If anyone could remove  books from libraries then there wouldnt be any books in the library	8
32013	4664	A book is a book	9
32014	4664	Not a criminal so why remove books from libraries	10
32015	4664	If a book can be published then it can be put in libraries	11
32016	4664	There is no reason for a book to be taken off the shelf because its been published so it's already open to the public.	12
32017	4666	When you walk into your local library there are thousands of books, magazines, movies, etc	0
32018	4666	You have different types and styles of books	1
32019	4666	There are fiction and nonfiction, comedy, horror, children books, and many more	2
32020	4666	Also what you might not know is some libraries have books that are either sexual, violent, disruptive, and aren't appropriate for young children	3
32021	4666	They could also have movies and magazines like that and that is not a good influence	4
32022	4666	When a young child walks into a library, they would expect to find a book with color, action, pictures, etc	5
32023	4666	But while they're browsing around they could run into a certain book thats not meant for them and they could end up becoming influenced	6
32024	4666	A book that is inappropriate for a child could possibly affect a childs life because they could go out into reality and try to immitate a book they have read and it could end up being the wrong decision	7
32025	4666	Inappropriate movie and magazines, such as pornagraphic magazines or pictures, rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 movies, shouldn't be allowed in a library	8
32026	4666	Items like that should be sold in a separate store	9
32027	4666	Items like these are meant for adults only	10
32028	4666	We should try to inspire our young children to do whats right and not try to convince them to do anything in a negative way	11
32029	4666	If you are going to have any of these items kept in your home, then keep them in a place where children can not find them	12
32030	4666	The generation that we live in now, most young people only focus on gang violonce, sex, rap music, and drugs and you can find all of this material in movies, books, and songs	13
32031	4666	If we keep all of these negative minded items out of public places such as libraries and even homes, then there could possibly be some change	14
32032	4666	Most rap songs you hear these days are either talking about violence, sex, or drugs	15
32033	4666	Most music should have a positive message to it	16
32034	4666	I feel if I see a book, movie, magazine, etc., sitting on a shelf where a young person can see it, I feel I should have the right to remove it because society is not like what it use to be and if we make a change like this, then I feel a few things can change	17
32035	4666	Eventhough I'm still young I feel my teenage generation should stop all the violence and stop becoming influenced by everything they see or hear, and if we focus on the more important things in life, then this world can be a whole different place.	18
32036	4667	Censorship in librarys can be a positive and negative thing	0
32037	4667	I think this because there can be somethings that you @MONTH1 not want your children to read	1
32038	4667	But there also can be things that you do want them to read	2
32039	4667	Age groups can play a big role in censorship because there are things that you dont want to see a kid reading when he or she is young	3
32040	4667	But if it is censored then they will not even be able to read it when they get older	4
32041	4667	It all depends on what kind of things are in the books, music, movies, and magazines	5
32042	4667	If you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine to some people that @MONTH1 not be offensive at all	6
32043	4667	This is why I think that the censorship can be good and bad	7
32044	4667	I am sure that there @MONTH1 be somethings that you have read that wasn't offensive to you but it @MONTH1 still be offensive to others	8
32045	4667	Censorship in my opinion can be a good thing when the things that are in the book, movie, magazine, and music are not true and that @MONTH1 be offensive to more than a small group	9
32046	4667	Lets say that there are two books written about the same true topic	10
32047	4667	The first books material is very well written and @MONTH1 have offensive material in it here and there	11
32048	4667	The second book is also well written but @MONTH1 not all be there the whole story @MONTH1 not be the same as what happened because they censored it because it can't be in the library	12
32049	4667	Which would you rather read	13
32050	4667	Personally I would rather read the book that @MONTH1 have some offensive material but has the complete story of what happend	14
32051	4667	Say you were the writer of a book and it took you a long time of hard work and dedication to finish the book and get it published	15
32052	4667	Would you want your book to be on the shelf at the library	16
32053	4667	I know I would but if your writing about something that happend in your life that could have been offensive to others they @MONTH1 not allow that book on the shelf of a library	17
32054	4667	If the things that are in the book are true or are in real life	18
32055	4667	Than why show your children a book that isn't true	19
32056	4667	Im not saying go get your child a war book and have them read it when they are very young	20
32057	4667	When reading a book that someone spent a long time and lots of hard work on you are looking into their perspective	21
32058	4667	Maybe there perspective of what happend is alot different than yours, but that can be a good thing	22
32059	4667	Even with the offensive material books, movies, magazines, and music can still be good to some people and bad to others	23
32060	4667	I have went to librarys and found books that I was interested in and I think that some of them could be found offensive to others	24
32061	4667	If the contents of the book, movie, magazine, and the music are not true and can be found offensive then sure that should be censored	25
32062	4667	But if it is censored it should only be for a certain age group	26
32063	4667	I have also went and got books at the library that have true stories that can be found offensive by some people, but that doesn't mean it should be censored	27
32064	4667	A book that @MONTH1 have material in them that could be 'bad' for some people	28
32065	4667	That does not mean that after they read it they are going to go start using the same offensive language that could be in the book	29
32066	4667	It all depends on the persons perspective if they find a book offensive or that has some 'bad' material in it then don't read it, and find something that you wouldnt find offensive	30
32067	4667	Overall the things that we read, watch, and listen to @MONTH1 not all be bad even if it has some offensive material in it	31
32068	4667	To some it can be bad to others it can be part of their life	32
32069	4667	If I had a story to tell and I spent a long time working on it	33
32070	4667	I would want it to be read, seen, and heard	34
32071	4667	Censorship @MONTH1 be good for some and bad for others	35
32072	4667	If you are a person that allways likes a happy ending then maybe censorship is good	36
32073	4667	But if you want the whole story that can be non-fiction or fiction then censorship is not for you.	37
32074	4668	If they are offensive they sholud be taken off the shelves becuase the little kids would'nt get they	0
32075	4668	And i think that they should not be and there and the frist place because almost every body goes to the lidraries	1
32076	4668	If i found the offensive they would promble get shut down or who ever put they would be fired	2
32077	4668	the kids should not see them or know about them at all	3
32078	4668	the offensive books, music,movies, magazines are not most to be found in a lidraries that kids go to	4
32079	4668	I think that most people would be mad at the schools or the libraries because they got them	5
32080	4668	And most pairnts would go talk to the people that did that	6
32081	4668	But if that happen to me if my kid came home with one of the offensive magazineas or any thing i would ask them where you get it and then go to talk to the poelpe that runs it	7
32082	4668	And most of the people that founds those things would be mad at the kids and its not their promble that someone did that	8
32083	4668	And the frist thing they should do is have a @NUM1 or older on the books, movies, magazines, and music if they are in the libraries	9
32084	4668	They should not be where the kids go and read books or nothing like that	10
32085	4668	They should be where the people that are @NUM1 or older get them but i still thing that they should not be and there	11
32086	4668	But if the offensive are in libraries people should take them to court offensive books, movies, magazines, and music	12
32087	4669	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, or music should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
32088	4669	I do believe so	1
32089	4669	The reason why is because there can be a lot of books, movies, or magazines in certain places like the library or stores that can involve offensive stuff, such as violence or other bad things	2
32090	4669	A lot of things can influence to the reader if they read a book that is offensive or if a kid see's a movie that involves violence	3
32091	4669	One reason I think that books should be removed from the shelves is if they are found offensive  because what if the reader is reading the book and they find a word that offends them	4
32092	4669	Or what if they read a book and it talks about bad stuff	5
32093	4669	Or maybe a kid can read a book and can learn bad stuff	6
32094	4669	A lot of things can just occurr while reading a book	7
32095	4669	And many people sometimes take it real offensive if the book talks about there religion, race, or anything that involves to there personal life	8
32096	4669	That's why I think books should be removed off the shelf, so people will not get offended	9
32097	4669	Another reason will have to be that if a kid or someone under age rents a movie or there parents rent the movie	10
32098	4669	Then the kid would probably want to see the movie and they would not know what the movie is about	11
32099	4669	The kid might see something that is bad or might see a lot of violence	12
32100	4669	Sometimes parents don't really realize what there kid's are watching	13
32101	4669	So it's important for them to learn and watch for there kids	14
32102	4669	In movie's anyone can  see a lot of bad thing that can effect anyone or can offend anyone	15
32103	4669	So I think that they should not have certain  movies on the  shelves that can harm or offend certain family or parents, espicially there kids	16
32104	4669	Magazines can also be found offensive to a lot of people	17
32105	4669	Whenever you go to the store you always see magazines on the shelves or somewhere else	18
32106	4669	It's either talking about singers, people divorcing, violence that ocurr around the world, arrests, or it could even have bad images that anyone could see	19
32107	4669	Which would be something bad, especially if a little kid picks up a magazine that has soemthing bad inside	20
32108	4669	That's why they shouldnt have magazines that have bad stuff in public	21
32109	4669	Or adults shouldn't buy certain type of magazines because they never know what there child can expect to see	22
32110	4669	So there is a lot of reasons why I think that people should remove certain book, movies, magazines, or anything that involves offensive stuff	23
32111	4669	All around the world you will see stuff that can offend you or anyone else just by seeing something on a movie, by listening to a song, or even my reading a book	24
32112	4669	It's just not a good idea of having stuff out there like that in certain places, like the library, stores, or anywhere else	25
32113	4669	Especially if there is people that take it really offensive when they see a title of a book that is bad or when they hear a song that has a lot of bad words	26
32114	4669	It's just wrong having stuff like that that can offend a lot of people	27
32115	4669	What if I read a book and it talks about my race or religion, would I take it offensive	28
32116	4669	People should ask themself that, before they read a book or see a movie	29
32117	4669	So they will decide whether or not they should have books, magazines, or music removed from the shelves.	30
32118	4670	Yes I do believe that certain books, movies, music, etc., should be removed	0
32119	4670	They should be put in a different position for children unable to find in the area	1
32120	4670	Because certain materials in the objects listed can start off bad behavior	2
32121	4670	In order to keep the objects from being found from childern is to set them in a different area	3
32122	4670	Some where childern are unable to reach	4
32123	4670	like in high areas like the top of the shelf, or the closet, maybe the attic	5
32124	4670	For better safe keepings place the certain objects you feel that can give childern bad ideas in a personal safe	6
32125	4670	where no one is able to get things out	7
32126	4670	It is important for some items to be seen, listened to, or watched for older people.For example, books can provide pictures for childern to do things that arn't right in there cerent age	8
32127	4670	Music can talk about stuff that that person done, and make that child want to do it because they might think its cool cause the artist does it	9
32128	4670	For the magazines they show articals of rapper, actors, and other famous people doing somthing wrong	10
32129	4670	showing a bad example for the child.Now for the materials they should be hidden in a place where no child would think to look at	11
32130	4670	Because the materials some times harm the child or maybe even put the child in the hospital	12
32131	4670	From experience I have thouched or took some material I shouldn't have messed with and the outcome wasn't good	13
32132	4670	From that experience I've learned not to thouch with items I know not to mess with	14
32133	4670	Thats why it is important to keep certain items from childern	15
32134	4670	Because the outcome maynot be what you wanted	16
32135	4670	serious actions might come from the objects, and later on come from the same child that either listed to, saw it, or looked at it	17
32136	4670	So make sure the items are safe from childern hands	18
32137	4671	I think that certain things in libraries should be taken off shelves if found offensive but not all	0
32138	4671	One of these things is anything that undermines or degrades one's religious beliefs	1
32139	4671	Another thing could be anything involving racial stereotypes or obvious racial comments	2
32140	4671	Having anything containing this could spark conflict within or outside of the library	3
32141	4671	Another thing that could be, but not entirely, removed from library material could be books that express violent or criminal acts	4
32142	4671	This type of material should only be given to an older audience	5
32143	4671	I think that anything that contains slander or judgement on another person's religious beliefs should be removed from library shelves	6
32144	4671	As time goes on people are taking religion more and more serious	7
32145	4671	With that being said I don't think anyone would want to read a book or watch a movie in which the things they believe in being made fun of or rejected	8
32146	4671	It @MONTH1 not seem like harmful material at first glance, but your opinion @MONTH1 change when your customers come back angry and frustrated about what they read and saw	9
32147	4671	It would be a better choice to avoid this conflict with your customers and keep this material out of your library, unless you want to deal with complaints and costant arguments	10
32148	4671	Another thing that needs to be removed is racial material	11
32149	4671	Racism has been one the worlds largest problems, it affects us all no matter who it's against	12
32150	4671	Picture a book in your library that calls all black teens a problem or a book that says all arabians dangerous, racist isn't it	13
32151	4671	Now imagine if your customers were of one of those two ethnicities, it's not a good picture at all	14
32152	4671	Keeping these stereotypes and harmful sayings off library shelves is a great business choice and will keep all customers happy	15
32153	4671	The last thing we want is for a customer to say 'those people are racist!'	16
32154	4671	Lastly I think books that express violent and criminal acts should be censored from minors	17
32155	4671	Kids always follow what they hear or what they see	18
32156	4671	Since they're still in that stage where they rarely do things in their own way they @MONTH1 mimic or copy things they see	19
32157	4671	Another problem that surrounds this is peer pressure which will get more and more children commiting these acts	20
32158	4671	If this is to happen many parents will become outraged and blame the libraries for relaeasing this material to children	21
32159	4671	So the best choice would be to keep this material away from minors, if it is contained within your library	22
32160	4674	Today, we all have a very large variety of books to choose from when we enter a library	0
32161	4674	Some are childrens books, while others are intended for a more mature reader	1
32162	4674	Many parents are scared that their child will read a book that @MONTH1 be inappropiate for their child	2
32163	4674	The thing is, if everyone removes the books that they don't find acceptable, there won't be any books left in the library for us to enjoy	3
32164	4674	What makes a book unacceptable to read	4
32165	4674	Could it be language, graphic scenes, or parts that are just extremely scary	5
32166	4674	Many people think that books like these should not be available for anyone to read	6
32167	4674	Removing a book from a library would be done through one's opinion	7
32168	4674	This is not fair because we all have the right to free press, which means that anyone can publish anything they wish to and everyone has the right to read it	8
32169	4674	By removing books from a library, you are violating not only the author's right, but the reader's as well	9
32170	4674	Unfourtunately, there are some books that @MONTH1 cause a child to become scared	10
32171	4674	When a child reads a book, it's harder for them to realize that they are just reading a book	11
32172	4674	Many children take in every word of a story and turn it into a reality	12
32173	4674	Not only can this scare a child, but it makes it extremely difficult to explain that what they read in the story is not true	13
32174	4674	As more and more of these books are released, the more likely it becomes that children will be reading these offensive stories	14
32175	4674	I believe that removing books from a library based on opinion is wrong	15
32176	4674	I understand that leaving these types of books out for children to read could cause a problem, but libraries are usually set up in sections	16
32177	4674	For instance, there is a childrens section, a teen section, and an adult section	17
32178	4674	This helps kids remain in an area appropiate for their age	18
32179	4674	I think that if a parent is worried enough that their child will read an offensive book, then they should go with their child to the library when checking out books to read	19
32180	4674	A public library is designed to accompany a vast variety of readers	20
32181	4674	There will always be certain books that some of us find offensive	21
32182	4674	Removing books from a library only decreases the number of books to choose from	22
32183	4674	and if that were to happen, there would eventually be no books left for anyone to enjoy.	23
32184	4676	OFFENSIVE BOOKS !!	0
32185	4676	Did you ever think about why students read what they are ready now	1
32186	4676	They read books about sex , guns , and many more because they think its exciting well guess what its not	2
32187	4676	The author's who make them type of books want you to buy them because they want their money , but they never think about the kids	3
32188	4676	Kids would read anything now because of those kind of things	4
32189	4676	I think that books like that should be removed because you dont want    your child to grow up reading those type of books then when they have kid  they wouldnt want the same	5
32190	4676	Many parents dont care what they chidren      read as long as they reading its fine with them , its not fine its very wrong and I wouldnt expect a great writer to use bad language also they think its okay to do that	6
32191	4676	Thats why kids act the way they do now is because of books , movies etc	7
32192	4676	I think they should really stop making those books or have their own stores to where like adults can go buy those books or whatever books they want	8
32193	4676	I dont think kids would want to read those type of books anyway because they dont want to learn that stuff but some of them do and i dont think thats right at all	9
32194	4676	Thats why kids should read a very good book and dont judge a book by its cover !@NUM1	10
32195	4677	Censorship in libraries could have negative effects on the library	0
32196	4677	Parents have different views on books, music, ect	1
32197	4677	One parent @MONTH1 not have a problem with one book that has a few curse words in it but another parent might think it is not something they want their children to pick up and read then later on start using that kind of language	2
32198	4677	But if the libraries censor that book and is taken out of the library it would make a big impact on people because, what if somebody really likes that book but since someone complained about it, it is now not allowed in the library	3
32199	4677	The library would lose people because of books being censored	4
32200	4677	Everybody might not agree on different subject and they would want a certain book, music, movie or magazine censored	5
32201	4677	But if one person complained and the book is no longer there does that mean the libraries are going to be empty for now on	6
32202	4677	A person who @MONTH1 not have children might say, '@CAPS1 one little joke can hurt.' A joke not suitable for a child under @NUM1 to read, hear, or watch	7
32203	4677	But a parent might get upset that their child is hearing, reading, or even seeing these things and might band it from the library	8
32204	4677	When a student @MONTH1 need to go to the library to go look up their topic they must research for school and can not find any or even good books on that topic because someone who thought the book was offensive has been removed from the library	9
32205	4677	The student might get frustrated and would not know what to do and would have to get most to all of their research off the @CAPS2	10
32206	4677	What if their teacher/proffesor said that they needed more then one source and all their information can not just be off the computer they need a book, magazine, or newspaper source also	11
32207	4677	But since that topic they are researching about has upset someone they are not able to find the imformation they are looking for	12
32208	4677	Yes, there are some books, music, movies, magazines, and sometimes newspapers that are not for children under @NUM1 or even pre-teens to teens	13
32209	4677	That is why the libraries are divided into sections for the age groups	14
32210	4677	Still how do these section keep our children from reading something unaporite	15
32211	4677	Parents should know when they come into a library they should look for signs on the walls, if a library does not have signs that tell them what kind of section they are coming into all they have to do is grab a few books of the shelfs and read the inside cover or outside to suggest what kind of books are in the rest of that section	16
32212	4677	It should not be hard to find these sections because usually the children section has toys and puzzles in them and children theme walls	17
32213	4677	Censorship would not only get rid of the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but it would also make our libraries empty	18
32214	4677	A lot of people have different point of views, his view might be diffrent from her view	19
32215	4677	From teens to young adults, teachers to children, parents to non-parents	20
32216	4677	Everyone is different no one person can speak for the whole world	21
32217	4677	This is why censorship would not work in our libraries.	22
32218	4678	A lot of people have huge debates over what they think is appropriate for children and teens to be reading, watching, and listening to	0
32219	4678	in this topic there will be opinions discussed and logical explanations to what some people think is the proper things kids should be exposed to	1
32220	4678	First, kids should not be watching rated @CAPS1 movies or even @NUM1 if it has vulgar content, sexual content, violence, and etc	2
32221	4678	Even though some parents allow this, these movies and magazines can still have a huge impact on the child and possibly on how they act in his or her future	3
32222	4678	Secondly, children still have a good number of movies for them to watch and learn from that can better themselves for their education, career, etc	4
32223	4678	Finally, teens and young adults exposed to this genre of movies, books, music, or any other media based entertainment are more likely to make destructive decisions than a teenager who doesn't	5
32224	4678	Although this is not always the case, it does increase the chances of wrong decisions and it does have and influence on the younger minds	6
32225	4678	In conclusion, young adults, teens, and children should not be able to watch media that contains vulgar content, sexual content, voilence, etc, without parent supervision and permission.	7
32226	4679	In libraries there should be a control over what certain kind of books, magazines, or movies that children should be able to read	0
32227	4679	For instance movies, are we going to go let a @NUM1 year watch a rated @CAPS1 movie much less let him/her watch a porn movie	1
32228	4679	No thats just plain wrong	2
32229	4679	That goes with magazines and books	3
32230	4679	Magazines have some images that aren't appropriate for the right age bracket that can easily pick it up and look at it	4
32231	4679	Books as well kids have very imaginative minds, they @MONTH1 not have pictures in them but still kids know a little more than what we give them credit for	5
32232	4679	Me, I would know this because as a little kid my brothers got a rated @CAPS1 film called '@CAPS3's @CAPS4'	6
32233	4679	After watching all @NUM2 of the films that were available at the time, I just could not look at a doll the same way again	7
32234	4679	Whenever my mom would get rid of a doll she used to own some of them had eyes that would move	8
32235	4679	I always sat at one side of the car while the doll would be as far away from me aas possible	9
32236	4679	To prevent other kids from experiencing what I did local libraries ought to create sections in the library where you've got your children section, the teen section, and the adult section	10
32237	4679	So then you can easily tell the kids to only go to either the teen section or the kids section	11
32238	4679	This should be the way to organize the films and magazines as well	12
32239	4679	I know some people wouldnt agree with my ideas but I have to ask them in return	13
32240	4679	Do you have any better ideas	14
32241	4679	Now for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive	15
32242	4679	I would say we keep it, our kids need to know our culture that way they can survive in it	16
32243	4679	They need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up	17
32244	4679	There's no way there going to be able to keep other people's opinions from coming ears length of the @CAPS3	18
32245	4679	If our children are to grow up maturley they need to experience or at least know what bullying is	19
32246	4679	Maybe learn what an athiest is or find out on their own what a sexist is	20
32247	4679	Some of it is inappropriat'e so i will agree that kids need to find this out at a certain age but you can't keep it out of their lives forever	21
32248	4679	Thats why its best not to throw the books out that mention those sort of things.	22
32249	4680	Censorship in Libraries     Have you ever came across something in the library that makes you say, ' @CAPS1	0
32250	4680	That's inappropriate!' If so, I am sure your not alone	1
32251	4680	Just the other day I was in the library	2
32252	4680	There were posters up all around featuring a new movie now avalible for rental	3
32253	4680	I remembered seeing ads for this particular movie on television that looked rather repulsive	4
32254	4680	How could they allow this kind of thing on display like this	5
32255	4680	How does this affect the minds of our country's youth	6
32256	4680	My thought on this topic is clear, although I am sure I'd recieve some opposition from others, considering everyone has their own opinions on this matter	7
32257	4680	I do realize the library has age limits on rentals, but what about all these posters everywhere	8
32258	4680	You don't necessarily have to rent the material to be corrupted by it	9
32259	4680	I believe there should be a separate section for this kind of material	10
32260	4680	Another example of library rentals that can be harmful to developing minds are @CAPS2	11
32261	4680	New music sometimes contains lewd or inappropriate lyrics that have no place in the library	12
32262	4680	Even the covers of some @CAPS2 should be removed for the good of the public	13
32263	4680	It's interesting how these things just slide by the library	14
32264	4680	I once saw a young by renting a @CAPS4 that had the words 'parental advisory' right on the cover	15
32265	4680	No one stopped him	16
32266	4680	Books are the same way	17
32267	4680	Disturbing covers and titles are littered throughout the library	18
32268	4680	No one even cares to screen these books before they hit the shelves	19
32269	4680	So, when do you think someone's going to do something about censorship in libraries	20
32270	4680	It is hard to say, but I strongly believe it's up to protesters like us to stop this	21
32271	4680	I hope you'll join me in this epic battle for censorship, to keep our youth safe	22
32272	4681	I personally do not think that books or magazines and such with offensive things about them shouldn't be removed because they give people something to read	0
32273	4681	Most people don't want to read @CAPS1 or a novel	1
32274	4681	Some people want to read about crimes, mysterys, and action	2
32275	4681	There are alot of good movies out there but some of them I can agree with are too offensive to others	3
32276	4681	I gurantee that movies with comedy in them will be put down about what is being said	4
32277	4681	For example: @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to some people is very offensive	5
32278	4681	The only reason the person would think that the movie is offensive is because they are stubborn people that don't have a life	6
32279	4681	I can believe that there are literature materials that are offensive to others, but the person that criticizes others doesn't think that they are offensive to the people that read the books that offened the person that is being offended	7
32280	4681	Books about war to some people are too graffic	8
32281	4681	But those books about war are probably books about history	9
32282	4681	I have only started noticing the people that are trying to get rid of those books that they don't like	10
32283	4681	But back in the @DATE1's people didn't care about what was in a library	11
32284	4681	They just want something to read	12
32285	4681	I say leave the librarys alone!	13
32286	4682	Censorship in libraries is a great issue in the world today	0
32287	4682	Many authors now use offensive methods and terms to persuade their audiences	1
32288	4682	However, many do not	2
32289	4682	All authors have the right to say what they wish but there is a limit to where the books should be placed and who should view them	3
32290	4682	If libraries accept offensive types of magazines, books, music, movies, etc., they should most certainly be placed out of the reach of children	4
32291	4682	Like many libraries in the city, there is a section for children and a sperate section for adults	5
32292	4682	Any materials that are found offensive should be placed in a special section of the adult area and customers should be warned in some way	6
32293	4682	Since everyone has their own view of what is right and what is wrong, a special team should be placed in charge of keeping the offensive materials seperate	7
32294	4682	Those who borrow anything at the library @MONTH1 have the right to bring that special book or movie to the attention of those in charge	8
32295	4682	By sticking to this method, offensive materials can stay out of the hands of those who do not wish to see them	9
32296	4682	Items containing vulgar language is unjust to most	10
32297	4682	There are still the majority, however, who engage in the oppertunity to view these materials	11
32298	4682	Everyone does have the right to do what they wish but, from personal experience and growing up in a home where I was taught right from wrong, people should be treated with dignity as well as respect	12
32299	4682	No matter our color, size, looks, or personalities, we are all created equally as our constitution says	13
32300	4682	Therefore, we should only view what would be considered just to all	14
32301	4682	After all, everyone wishes to be treated kindly, right	15
32302	4683	Public libraries should be able to keep all sorts of content for all sorts of people	0
32303	4683	I feel very strongly about my statement, because everyone in this world is different	1
32304	4683	Many people have different interests, religons, and customs	2
32305	4683	If we took out certain books, and music from the library, it would defeat the purpose of calling it the public library	3
32306	4683	But if we had different sections of books, music, etc., people would be able to find what they want/need more easily, and no one would have to worry about getting offended	4
32307	4683	It would not be fair to anyone in this world if we took out certain books and materials because one person had got offended.	5
32308	4684	People in this common era have different appproaches to the idea of libraries	0
32309	4684	Some view the library as a place to go and learn and to express yourself and be free	1
32310	4684	Others believe it to be a place where there is danger for minors and can be very innapropriate	2
32311	4684	These two opinions can cause an intriguing argument	3
32312	4684	People go to the library because they want to either get away, or just to be free and grab a nice book	4
32313	4684	There are many books to choose from, but you need to be careful while browsing	5
32314	4684	some books, although good, can be innapropriate to some ages, and that's when controversy spills	6
32315	4684	Parents think the library is encouraging the check-out of innapropriate books, but this isn't all that true	7
32316	4684	It's all about the placement of books, and that's what most librarians will tell you	8
32317	4684	They didn't encourage the kid to check it out, but they have every right to	9
32318	4684	It is also unknown that what is offensive to one person, might bring joy to another person maybe of a different race or ethnic background	10
32319	4684	I think that these so-called offensive books or magazines that parents complain about, should not be removed from libraries	11
32320	4684	There is a reason those books are there and they are not put up there to be offensive	12
32321	4684	so why take them down	13
32322	4684	I think a way we can monitor these kids to stay away from books their parents believe can be harmful to them is by making a rule stating that a child must be present with an adult in certain sections	14
32323	4684	This will not only stop the fact that kids checkout books much innapropriate for them, but it might also make the parents stop complaining and the controversy will end	15
32324	4684	People need to stop looking at the library as a place that brings negativity, but as a place for giving children joy	16
32325	4684	Remember, it was built for those who enjoy reading and so people can have a place to do so	17
32326	4684	Why complain	18
32327	4684	Find the positives in what it brings instead of looking down on it	19
32328	4684	Bring back the feelings of what the library brought to you when you were a child.	20
32329	4685	Most modern day book, movies, music, etc	0
32330	4685	do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticks on their covers	1
32331	4685	But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today	2
32332	4685	Why	3
32333	4685	Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive	4
32334	4685	But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem	5
32335	4685	There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society	6
32336	4685	Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example	7
32337	4685	In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time.	8
32338	4685	Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned	9
32339	4685	It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past	10
32340	4685	I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words	11
32341	4685	If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all	12
32342	4685	It should be read	13
32343	4685	Movies have a rating system for a reason	14
32344	4685	There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience	15
32345	4685	People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'	16
32346	4685	Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years	17
32347	4685	A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4	18
32348	4685	Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong	19
32349	4685	That is the fault of the parents	20
32350	4685	They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place	21
32351	4685	So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15	22
32352	4685	If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay	23
32353	4685	And that brings us to music	24
32354	4685	There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive	25
32355	4685	There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today	26
32356	4685	But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then	27
32357	4685	The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it	28
32358	4685	The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker	29
32359	4685	When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to	30
32360	4685	Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'	31
32361	4685	So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves	32
32362	4685	Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person	33
32363	4685	There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society	34
32364	4685	People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned	35
32365	4685	They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it	36
32366	4685	And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15	37
32367	4685	Well, this pattern has been going on for years	38
32368	4685	Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else	39
32369	4685	So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place.	40
32370	4686	What do you want your children to be able to see in their public library	0
32371	4686	As we all know, there are things like books, picture, and movies that we do not want our younger generation to see	1
32372	4686	This is @CAPS1 parents are so carful with computers, and what their children have access to	2
32373	4686	Every situation has it's pros and cons, but in @CAPS2 cases if you analize the pros and cons you can come to an accurate conclusion	3
32374	4686	When you go to a library with your children, the children run off to do what they want, usually to the children's section	4
32375	4686	Let's face it, children do not want to look at adult book	5
32376	4686	Once children learn to read you might come across a bigger problem	6
32377	4686	As children get older they want to be able to do more things, like watching older movies, reading harder books, and look at want they want on the computer	7
32378	4686	I'm sure that the first thing that might come to mind is to censor the library, take away the horror films, the banned books excetra	8
32379	4686	This might be fine at first, but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want	9
32380	4686	The library is free, does this mean that if our society does not like a book, movie, or magazine taht the adults must go somewhere else to pay for a particular book or movie as apposed to borrowing if for free at the public library	10
32381	4686	It could work, but if a child is going to look at bad things at a library what will stop him/her from looking at them at a bookstore	11
32382	4686	Another issue is banned books	12
32383	4686	@CAPS2 of them are classics that past generations have read in school	13
32384	4686	@CAPS1 would we decide to take these books away now	14
32385	4686	It makes it seem like the younger generations can not handle it, or that past generations have something to hide	15
32386	4686	The definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time	16
32387	4686	Does it just end here and now	17
32388	4686	@CAPS1 would we take the classics away	18
32389	4686	Let's face it, if the classics are not read in school today, and they are not read in the next generations what is stopping them from being forgetten	19
32390	4686	Some banned books parents will look at and say, '@CAPS1 would this be banned	20
32391	4686	I do not remember anything bad in it.' @CAPS2 of the time the classic banned books were written some time in the @DATE1, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 or the @CAPS6 @CAPS7	21
32392	4686	Society was different then	22
32393	4686	When you read a classic it acts as a history book to show us how it was to live during the time it was written	23
32394	4686	Usually the book will be banned because of bad language which people thing should be taken out of our schools, but they are missing the point	24
32395	4686	That was how things were back then so, who are we to hide it	25
32396	4686	Does this mean that I think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries	26
32397	4686	Not at all	27
32398	4686	Some magazines can be avoided, or be put in a section away from younger children's eyes	28
32399	4686	Horror movies do not have to be taken out completly, just put in a different section	29
32400	4686	If parents are worried about monetering their children on the internet there is nothing stopping them from watching their children while they are using a computer	30
32401	4686	I think that there can be come cesorship in libraries, but sometimes our society goes overboard	31
32402	4686	As long as we keep an open mind and make the right decisions for our future generations we can make our country a safe yet edjucational place to learn	32
32403	4687	Have you ever read something that you have found offensive, upsetting, or has made you mad	0
32404	4687	Do you think that there are certian books that shouldn't be allowed in a library because of its content	1
32405	4687	A lot of books, music, movies, and magazines these days contain things that are hurtful to society or protray bad images of certian social groups	2
32406	4687	In @DATE1's society there are many different groups of people and a lot of them have thier own opinions on how they view different things	3
32407	4687	To me, when I think about a library, I think about how all different ages of people go to them, how there are many different groups of people there, and about the types of books that are in there	4
32408	4687	Taking this all into concideration, I believe that everything should be allowed in public libraries but I do think that there should be seperate places for books, magazines, and movies that should be only for adults	5
32409	4687	I think this because if you take away all the things that are 'bad' or 'offensive' to you, you could be displeasing those who find these things interesting or enjoy reading them	6
32410	4687	In this case, people would not come to the library anymore because they cannot read what they enjoy reading or find interesting	7
32411	4687	By saying these things, seperating the books into age groups is a good thing because then the younger children who are running around the library will not pick up something that they should not be looking at	8
32412	4687	I also believe that is would benefit them because then if someone comes into the library looking for a book but does not really know what to do and they go to where their age group would be	9
32413	4687	then they can see everything that is recommended for them	10
32414	4687	From my own experience, I know that I have read some books and looked at some magazines that I probably should not have looked at because I was too young	11
32415	4687	This does not mean that they need to take them off the shelves but maybe that they should be placed in an area where someone my age will not be able to find them	12
32416	4687	So the next time you go to the library and see something that is offensive to you, just remember that there are a lot of different people in this world who might find what you think is offensive, interesting	13
32417	4688	Yes, there are a lot of books out there that have graphic and sexual phrases, and there are alot of concernd parents out there that are worried about what the libraries are possibly letting their kids read	0
32418	4688	One good idea would be to put age limit signs in certain areas on the libraries, that dosent neccisarrly mean that the kid is goin to listen to that sign	1
32419	4688	We all know for a fact that pornagraphy will stay away from libraries and stay were they are at right now so thats not an issue the parents should worry about	2
32420	4688	I think the libraries should be broken onto sections	3
32421	4688	Theres a kid section, a teen section, and a adult section, but i don't think that the adult section should be to far off the teen section because when we say adult books or magazines everybody expects it to be one thing, porn	4
32422	4688	It should still be some type of book with some kind of censorship to it	5
32423	4688	There should be doors blocking each entrance to each section of books, and to get to them you to show the librarian some proof of age to be able to get into those sections, except the kid section	6
32424	4688	The kid section is a section that all kids can use, because we know that that section of books would be harmless to kids	7
32425	4688	I think that with that kind of security it would let parents to be able to be less stressed and worried for their childs safety and insecurity of the mind	8
32426	4688	There are tons of other ideas to explore to be able to try and keep books with some kind of censorship but most of them are off the wall and rediculus	9
32427	4688	I think that musoc and movies shouldn't even be in libraries just leave those to other stores it's better to let stores deal with that than libraries	10
32428	4688	The librarian probably dosen't even know half the cds that probably get checked out anyways	11
32429	4688	So it's best if you don't have those in there at all	12
32430	4688	Give some thought to these ideas that I just sprong at you	13
32431	4688	I personally think that having doors blocking to get to certain books would be a great plan to use, because it would block access to these areas from certain kids	14
32432	4688	Some other parents or people might have ideas of there own and it would be great to hear them or have some kind of bullitun about them around the city ofr town	15
32433	4689	Look it's a plane, it's a bird, it's a...harmful word	0
32434	4689	There has been many times when i have read a passage wether it be a magazine article, a book or a newspaper and I have come across harmful words	1
32435	4689	They @MONTH1 not all mean harm towards me but towards other readers they could	2
32436	4689	People have their own opinnions on different views, so a word or passage could effect me differently then say smeone else	3
32437	4689	I don't think it's the materials I think it's the readers maturity level that makes a difference	4
32438	4689	That is how harmful words get changed into names and then the next thing peers are calling other peers that word	5
32439	4689	For instnce the word 'wetback' in biography book about the @CAPS1 it is okay to be there, it is when the reader inturperates it the wrong way, and they think it is funny, and cool to go around and call someone that word, especially a person of that race	6
32440	4689	That is when I dont think materials like this should be on shelves, but then again it goes back to the maturity level	7
32441	4689	These words or passages can become harmful to someone that hasn't even read it, but because someone that has took the iniciative to start calling someone that word, or relating that passage to them	8
32442	4689	Books can, and are a great reliable source for schoolers that are researching for class projects, i think it's the certain topics of books that's get these words turned into harm	9
32443	4689	Books about certain races can cause name calling among a school just because they read it in a book and think it is okay, because the book described a person that way doesn't mean it's okay for the reader to start calling people by that word	10
32444	4689	Other topics like 'sex' in a book can be inturperated in the wrong way as well	11
32445	4689	Some teens think it's okay just because the characters in the book are doing it then it's okay for them and their significant other to try it	12
32446	4689	Either way with the book left on the shelf or taken off it is still going to be a problem with name calling	13
32447	4689	So it's going to take something else then a materials being removed from a shelf to find a solution to this problem	14
32448	4690	Cencorship is a very large thing to talk about	0
32449	4690	Some people think that a book has too much talking about sex in it, while others think that it is sutable for the public	1
32450	4690	Sometimes people want other people to make the decitions on what they read	2
32451	4690	People need to decide what they do and don't want to read and see	3
32452	4690	Firstly, people think that other people are incable of deciding for them selves what they want to read	4
32453	4690	They blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see	5
32454	4690	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 books were block because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it	6
32455	4690	Grapes of @CAPS3 was banded because their was slavery in it	7
32456	4690	Even though slavery was a big thing they still did not want any of the younger people to have it	8
32457	4690	Secondly, some music and movies should be banned	9
32458	4690	Music has become a way for people to express them selves	10
32459	4690	Latily they have gotten to the point that drugs and 'hos' are alright to talk about	11
32460	4690	One song that I just saw was called @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7	12
32461	4690	Now if that is not sending a bad message than I don't know was is a good message	13
32462	4690	Movies are in the same boat as music	14
32463	4690	They are showing the violence that people only have in their head	15
32464	4690	@PERSON1 was a movie that off the top of my head was showing a minner that had gone completly blood thursty and was killing any one that went in his cave, just because he could	16
32465	4690	Although, somethings we need to see the things that people have in @CAPS8 heads	17
32466	4690	I know that I am going to be more carful when I am out	18
32467	4690	In conclution, @CAPS8 is no real yes or no anser	19
32468	4690	@CAPS8 is always exceptions to whatever people say	20
32469	4690	This is why people need to decide what they do and don't watch and read	21
32470	4691	What race are you	0
32471	4691	What religion are you	1
32472	4691	What have you been taught	2
32473	4691	Almost anything like these could be considered offensive	3
32474	4691	So should these types of things be taken out of libraries	4
32475	4691	No, these types of things are everywhere	5
32476	4691	You just can't get away from them	6
32477	4691	Today you can find so many offensive television shows and commercials	7
32478	4691	For example the commercials for @CAPS1 gum with that @CAPS2 woman, some people might consider that offensive	8
32479	4691	You might ask, '@CAPS3', well there might be a person who has a diesease who can't get that 'clean feeling' and always has bad breath	9
32480	4691	That person might take offense to these commercials	10
32481	4691	Another example might be television shows, like @ORGANIZATION1	11
32482	4691	Some @CAPS4 and just other races get offended by these types of things	12
32483	4691	Does that really mean we should get rid of them though	13
32484	4691	People everywhere are somehow offended by something, the world isn't perfect	14
32485	4691	Even if we did take out these types of offensive material in libraries, it could still be seen	15
32486	4691	So whats the point	16
32487	4691	If you tried to take it all out, like everywhere in the world everything would be crazy	17
32488	4691	There is no such thing as a perfect world, I believe if there was people would go crazy	18
32489	4691	For example in the movie '@CAPS5 @CAPS6,' the main character finds a town that is suppose to resemble 'The @CAPS7 @CAPS8' or a perfect society	19
32490	4691	In the town at first everything is nice, but then everyone is so perfect that he can't stand it and leaves	20
32491	4691	The best thing to do is let these materials stick around because there is nothing you can do to get them gone from everywhere else	21
32492	4691	Also they help kids learn, if you keep them locked up and not knowing anything, then how far are they going to get in life	22
32493	4691	So should these things go away or not	23
32494	4691	What do you think?	24
32495	4692	Is there a song that your parents wouldn't let you listen to when you were a child	0
32496	4692	When you sang this song did they yell at you and ground you because they had told you many times before that you weren't allowed to listen to it	1
32497	4692	How about a movie that you wanted to go watch because it was what everyone was talking about but it was rated @CAPS1 so you weren't allowed to watch it	2
32498	4692	That book on that shelf that you accidentally ran into while doing a research project	3
32499	4692	Containing inappropriate language and terms	4
32500	4692	There is much media and books that are out there that parents wouldn't want their children to read	5
32501	4692	But over all there is the government who censors things going on around the world	6
32502	4692	Censoring can have good and bad qualities	7
32503	4692	In my experience I've noticed that people that know less tend to be more happy than people who know more	8
32504	4692	But if you are able to read and or watch these censored materials you would see the idea from a certain point of view, and maybe agree with the person	9
32505	4692	Most news is about things that are bad, rarely any good news comes around	10
32506	4692	For example if something were to happen in @LOCATION1, where thousands of people were being used to test if lions liked to eat humans, the government would censor the news to the people in their country due to any reason	11
32507	4692	If there was movie that was made that was racist against @CAPS2 people the government would probably censor it	12
32508	4692	Things that look bad tend to be censored	13
32509	4692	I've noticed that people who read censored material feel special because they read or saw something that wasn't supposed to be known by the rest of the population	14
32510	4692	A lot more freedom of speech would occur if censored material wasn't censored	15
32511	4692	People also tend to become mad when they find out that material is being censored because they feel like something is being hidden for them, could be valuable information	16
32512	4692	In reading I have noticed that societies that practice censorship tend to have angry citizens	17
32513	4692	But in the other hand if they believe that it's for the good of the society then they accept the fact that it's not good for them	18
32514	4692	People also want to be given the right to make their own decisons	19
32515	4692	In a censored civilizaton they have no idea what is going on outside their borders and are usually clueless or being lied to by their government	20
32516	4692	Censorship can have good and bad qualities	21
32517	4692	People tend to be offended when material is censored, but it's probably for the best for them	22
32518	4692	Hidden information could be good and bad but mostly bad, most people want to know the truth rather than a lie	23
32519	4692	Censorship is just bad in general, people should have the right to make their own decisions on what they want to read or watch.	24
32520	4693	I somewhat agree with taking out books,music,movie,magazines, or any other material that could be offensive to someone, because it could be racial or it could be about something that isn't appropriote for children to read	0
32521	4693	I think it just depends on the topic, maybe one thing could be offensive to one person and not the other, so people should choose wisely what they read	1
32522	4693	It wouldn't be fair to take certain books from the shelves of libaries because people take different interset in different topics, so say one book has something in it that someone doesn't think is appropriote but another person think that book is fine, it wouldn't be fair to the other person to take that book from the shelves	2
32523	4693	But something that I do disagree with in books or magizines that is inappropriote is pictures and comics, because children shouldn't be allowed to have access to a book,movie, or a magazine that has that type of content in it	3
32524	4693	But also I think that parents or an adult should look at the criteria first before they allow a child to read or see it	4
32525	4693	So it depends on what type of things are in the book,movie, or magazine	5
32526	4693	Basically it's up to the person, if they don't like the criteria in any of those things then they shouldnt look into it	6
32527	4694	Do you think that certain materials should be removed off library's bookselfs if someone dislikes or does not agree with the topic or the plot	0
32528	4694	Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers	1
32529	4694	I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive	2
32530	4694	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self	3
32531	4694	But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	4
32532	4694	And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true	5
32533	4694	Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from	6
32534	4694	I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book	7
32535	4694	They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible	8
32536	4694	Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good	9
32537	4694	So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book	10
32538	4694	I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality	11
32539	4694	Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books	12
32540	4694	Everyone should get a large variety	13
32541	4695	Have you ever went to the library and while looking for a book you come across a book about slavery with strong language or teenage years which included alcohol, drugs, and sexual content	0
32542	4695	In the library, you can find books for leisure, study, training, and books found offensive to a variety of people	1
32543	4695	People from children whose parents would be appalled by what their kids are reading about to adults find books offensive	2
32544	4695	Although there is things in the library that are found offensive, I believe that books, movies, magazines, and music with offensive things in them should stay on the shelves because the internet is no different then the offensive things in a library, most people don't mind the vulgar and violence within the pages, and there are some fantastic books that some might find offensive	3
32545	4695	People for centuries have been writing and coming up with songs, movies, and magazines	4
32546	4695	What was accepted 'back then' is now considered inappropriate for viewers and readers	5
32547	4695	There are many things in a library that, if not careful, could corrupt your children	6
32548	4695	Children reading about violence, drugs, and other no no's are what teaches them wrong	7
32549	4695	Parents and other people have been concerned about the censorship of libraries	8
32550	4695	Hard enough as it is, parenting doesn't need the help of books, movies, and music to influence the bad onto children	9
32551	4695	Children are the future and they need to be taught the right way	10
32552	4695	An old librarian once told me that books need to be cherished throughout the years because they will eventually be replaced with technology and all the books, good or bad, will be gone	11
32553	4695	It's hard to even imagine how technology is replacing various things in our lives and how it has changed from when it first started to be popular	12
32554	4695	How does this pertain to offensive books	13
32555	4695	Like almost everything out there, the internet could be used for good, or for harm	14
32556	4695	Parents are concerned about their children reading books that are bad but let their child surf the internet which is hard telling how many inappropriate sites he/she might go to accidentally, or on purpose	15
32557	4695	Books, music, and other offensive stuff in libraries are minor compared to the internet	16
32558	4695	Protecting children from adult content filled libraries should be the least of a parents concerns	17
32559	4695	Even if they are concerned about the minds of their children when they go inside a library, they can filter what a child looks at and reads about	18
32560	4695	The internet is the real bad guy if anything is going to be blamed for corruption of minds	19
32561	4695	Many people throughout the world have different tastes of what they like in a book	20
32562	4695	A good plotline, good dialogue, interesting theme, drama, language, violence, drugs, alcohol, and sex are all ways people find reading books enjoyable	21
32563	4695	Their own opinion on what is interesting is what helps them decide on books to read	22
32564	4695	Reading books is a passion to some and enjoyable books is a must for them	23
32565	4695	Without offensive books, people would find reading boring, and wouldn't be as popular as it has been	24
32566	4695	I don't know about you, but I enjoy books that aren't boring	25
32567	4695	Most offensive books are not boring and the action is what gets my attention and keeps me reading	26
32568	4695	There are great books that for years people have enjoyed reading and continue to read today	27
32569	4695	Even thought they are offensive, they provide good details that are required for a good book	28
32570	4695	Tom @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are famous for writing ghory, violent, grusome books that would be qualified as offensive to others	29
32571	4695	You have the choice not to read them or to read them	30
32572	4695	Books that deal with slavery @MONTH1 also be found offensive like the book @CAPS1	31
32573	4695	It does a supurb job at describing how things were during slave times	32
32574	4695	Books, music, magazines and music should not be removed from the book shelves because they are essensial to everyday people and reading	33
32575	4695	They are required by some to enjoy a good book.	34
32576	4696	Hi, my name is mason and i'm writing about wether we should take books off the self and etc	0
32577	4696	People have differnt views on differnt things	1
32578	4696	Books, books give a differnt form of lerning to differnt people.I personal don't learn from books as well as I do from the internet or tv but books are nice to have every once in a great while	2
32579	4696	Eeryone like to sit down and read a good book every once in a while	3
32580	4696	Music doesn't really teach you anything, it relaxs you in differnt ways	4
32581	4696	Some people might learn from listening to music but i'm not one of those peole	5
32582	4696	It influnce you to get movited, say your getting ready for a football game and you want to get hyped up for it, well some music can get you hyped up for that game	6
32583	4696	When i sit down and watch a movie I can learn from it cause i have the patien to sit down and watch it, to learn from it but that is just me other people have differnt ways of learning but the best way for me is to watch movies	7
32584	4696	They get stright to the point and don't waste time telling you stuff you alredy know	8
32585	4696	Magazines are helpful to they have short artcicles that get stright to the point too, and that is what I like about magazines and movies	9
32586	4696	Even though there are very few magazines that give out helpful information, the ones that do help out alot	10
32587	4696	So I think that music should be taken off shelves because they don't really teach you alot but books, movies, and magazine do help you to a certian point	11
32588	4696	It is up the other people to decide wether music should be taken off the shelves not just one person cause music might help other people in differnt ways not just one way but many ways too	12
32589	4697	I am a student from @CAPS1	0
32590	4697	I wanted to let you know  that there have been some great and interesting books that I have read from the schools library and the public library as well	1
32591	4697	The only problem is that there have been some complaints from my friends and families about the books	2
32592	4697	Not only that but I've also seen books that are not appropriate for children to be reading	3
32593	4697	I just wanted to let you know this because I was kind of thinking that taking books out wouldn't be a good idea for them to do	4
32594	4697	I think so because without books less people would want to read and not learn	5
32595	4697	To begin with, I wanted to talk about the complaints that friends have told me	6
32596	4697	One of them was that at the school there had not been good books to read and that they want to take most of them out and replace them with the ones they like	7
32597	4697	I was thinking that if they did that they would be the only ones to go to the library because it is only there choice and not everyones	8
32598	4697	So what I'm trying to say is that if we don't have good books students won't be going to the library	9
32599	4697	If they don't get books then they won't do well in school which is something that will affect the school	10
32600	4697	Furthermore about the complaints was that one of my own family member had seen  a young girl looking at a book that was not appropriate for her at the public library	11
32601	4697	So instead of taking those types of books out they should be put into a room that is strictly not for children to go in	12
32602	4697	They should do that because if it were to be taken out then that book wouldn't ever be used again	13
32603	4697	Also another reason is that If they were to be taken out, then another peson might need information over the topic of the book and wouldn't be able to find it because it isn't there	14
32604	4697	That is why I thing those types of books should be in a special room intead of them being taken out	15
32605	4697	Finally, as I had somewhat mentioned earlier is that books are truly important	16
32606	4697	That is why I go against taking books out that are not favored by others	17
32607	4697	If a person doesn't like a certain book/ magazine  then they should just request the book/ magazie that they want to read	18
32608	4697	By doing that then the book that arn't being used could actually be used by someone else that is intersted in it	19
32609	4697	So if we keep all our book, then more students and people would go and read	20
32610	4697	In conclusion, people might say that taking out book is better than keeping them	21
32611	4697	Well in the way I see it, they are wrong because keeping them is better	22
32612	4697	It is better because  someday those books can be useful nomatter how old they are	23
32613	4697	If they were inappropriate books like metioned earlier, they should be put away in a good place	24
32614	4697	If there arn't enough interesing ones then requesting one is another way to do it	25
32615	4697	That is why I think that taking out books from the shelves is wrong and they should do watever in order to not let books go to waist	26
32616	4698	There are things in this world that are relative	0
32617	4698	Censorship is one of them	1
32618	4698	Relative means that one person has a different view than that of another	2
32619	4698	Censorship is when a person or organization in authority does not allow people to see things that they believe are inappropriate	3
32620	4698	One phrase that is very important to censorship is 'things that they believe.' @CAPS1 is inappropriate to one person could be deemed viewable to another	4
32621	4698	This should not be decided by one person or even one group that believes they know @CAPS1 is socially acceptable or politically correct	5
32622	4698	Censorship in libraries are not a good thing	6
32623	4698	@PERSON3 and @CAPS2 walk into a library, and there is a magazine on the rack that depicts a person standing over a two hundred pound, twenty four point, state record, whitetail deer with with a gun in their hand	7
32624	4698	@PERSON3 is a firm believer in providing for his family and the rights given to an individual in the second ammendment of the @LOCATION1 constitution	8
32625	4698	Even if that means killing an animal for its resources	9
32626	4698	For some there is pride in harvesting an animal and knowing that they provided that meat	10
32627	4698	@PERSON3 will see the magazine as an opportunity	11
32628	4698	He might learn tips from the magazine, or find some new gear that he thinks could be useful	12
32629	4698	@CAPS2 on the other hand is a conservative	13
32630	4698	She believes killing is wrong and inhumane	14
32631	4698	She goes to the store and buys her meat from the freezer section	15
32632	4698	@CAPS2 prefers not to know where her meat came from	16
32633	4698	She will view this magazine as inappropriate	17
32634	4698	Again, censorship is relative to the person looking over the material	18
32635	4698	Does that mean that just because @CAPS2 thinks the magazine is inappropriate, it should be taken off of the shelf so that someone like @PERSON3 can not read it, appreciate it, and gain knowledge from it	19
32636	4698	That choice is up to @CAPS2 not to read the magazine, not to the librarian	20
32637	4698	@CAPS2 is responsible for her own views and choices	21
32638	4698	She is entitled to them	22
32639	4698	@PERSON3 is entitled as well	23
32640	4698	Leave the choice to the reader	24
32641	4698	Over in the book section there are @PERSON1 and @PERSON2	25
32642	4698	@PERSON1 is a fanatic for science and history	26
32643	4698	@PERSON2 has a preference for religious books that explain the theology behind some of the things the world says and things of his religion	27
32644	4698	At the end of the row, on top of the shelf sits a book on the topic of evolution	28
32645	4698	@PERSON1 belives this theory and sees the book as interesting	29
32646	4698	@PERSON2 looks at the book and thinks to himself, 'That stuff is not true	30
32647	4698	Why would anyone waste their time reading it.' Does that mean that the book should be taken off the shelf because @PERSON2 will not read it	31
32648	4698	@PERSON2 should just walk away from it	32
32649	4698	If he chooses not to, that is up to @PERSON2	33
32650	4698	Leave that choice to @PERSON2	34
32651	4698	Up at the desk there are the librarians.They have their views and opinions and are entitled to them as well	35
32652	4698	But the books, music, movies, and magazines that are displayed  for checking out should not be chosen because he or she likes them or opposes them, but because someone might be looking for the information in that material	36
32653	4698	If the choice is left to them that material might not be available to the reader that needs it	37
32654	4698	Censorship is a terrible thing for libraries	38
32655	4698	It takes material away from people that can be useful	39
32656	4698	Censorship, along with many other things is relative	40
32657	4698	@CAPS1 one person @MONTH1 deem inappropriate could be viewed as totally fine with another person	41
32658	4698	Based on moral values, character, and opinions developed with progression of life, people have made judgements on @CAPS1 is appropriate or unacceptable	42
32659	4698	That choice to look at that magazine, read that book, or listen to that song should be left up to them, not made for them.	43
32660	4699	Have it ever occured to you that some of the things we read about and take home from libraries are not for young children	0
32661	4699	Certain materials that are found in libraries are sometimes not age appropriate or even offensive to other people	1
32662	4699	Not all books, music, movies, and magazines offend people or condone in things but they also give children the right to learn about things or know things that are to rated and shouldnt be learned at a library	2
32663	4699	Most music in todays society is not appropiate because of the content that is used such as sex,drugs, and violence	3
32664	4699	last fall when I visited my shools library I came across a movie that I thought was not school appropiate and should'nt be seen without a parents verification	4
32665	4699	Anything about sex and drugs give young teens and children the right away to do it even if they read it, heard it, or saw it in school	5
32666	4699	when im walking through the town and I see teens doing things that should'nt be done the first thing the first thing he/or she says is 'I heard it on a movie'	6
32667	4699	Most public lbraries have movies, book, music, and etc on shelves that aren't appropiate but it should'nt be welcomed to young children	7
32668	4699	most librians are busy and cant watch the entire library, but can make sure it is secured and put away from juveniles	8
32669	4699	Most of the time a child will read what looks interesting and fun	9
32670	4699	Todays books that condone violence have guns drugs and sexual content on the front cover making it hard for a child not to want to read it	10
32671	4699	In a school library @PERCENT1 of the time all books are age appropiate, but in a public library it's not because the public library is not just for children but for adults too	11
32672	4699	some books shouldnt be of shelves but the rated things should be	12
32673	4699	In conclusion libraries need to watch what's being checked out no matter who its from and I.d should be asked for.	13
32674	4700	All things in the world are not strictly black and white	0
32675	4700	Every person is different, with varying ideas	1
32676	4700	So when some people are certain that a specific word or topic should be restricted, there will always be another person to say the exact opposite	2
32677	4700	Sometimes, what's found as 'vulgar' can only be introduced with the intent of education	3
32678	4700	Also, this ties in with something our country was founded on, which is freedom of the speech, and the press	4
32679	4700	Magazines, music, books and movies are mainly for entertainment	5
32680	4700	Everyone who reads or watches something will take it in differently, and it will have a varying effect	6
32681	4700	Let's say there is a @NUM1-year-old girl who just had her first day of high school	7
32682	4700	While at lunch, she slipped and dropped her tray of food	8
32683	4700	Later that day while she's alone reading her favorite magazine, she's reading an article about embarrassing stories, where one girl accidentally walked into a boys' restroom	9
32684	4700	Some parents @MONTH1 deem this inappropriate, but it has made the young girl feel better about her situation	10
32685	4700	It's human to mess up and act crazy	11
32686	4700	we aren't perfect by nature	12
32687	4700	So when we see errors made into comedies and dramas by any form of media, it's human to realize that we aren't the only ones who undergo these events	13
32688	4700	To censor books and televisions would be like claiming nothing bad happens	14
32689	4700	Not to say that a novel written about brutal murder that contains sexual references should be given to a little kid, but it should not be pulled from the shelf all together	15
32690	4700	The topic of censorship in schools is also a very sensitive one, especially with younger kids	16
32691	4700	As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if every parent had the right to remove a book that they thought was not suitable, then eventually there would be nothing left	17
32692	4700	Many parents are uneasy with the thought of their child being taught things like sexual education, but on the other hand, there are also the parents who appreciate it	18
32693	4700	They do so not because it saves them time, but because certain explicit topics - to an extent - can help someone mature if it's done in a controlled environment	19
32694	4700	Years ago, it was not uncommon to see censorship in the media	20
32695	4700	It could range from saying 'intercourse' to replace 'sex' or it could be something like extreme propoganda	21
32696	4700	There's a reason that our consitution protects freedom of speech	22
32697	4700	No matter how appauling someone @MONTH1 find a topic, it usually has some type of informative purpose	23
32698	4700	Otherwise, it probably wouldn't have gotten issued	24
32699	4700	Choosing what is and isn't offensive is a matter of opinion	25
32700	4700	As previously stated, no two humans are exactly the same, and their opinions won't be either	26
32701	4700	So this means that if one person out of a group is allowed to dispose of or censor whatever they find necessary, it must be recognized that some portion of the remaining people will be unsatisfied	27
32702	4700	This is usually where people will claim that the law protects their freedom of speech	28
32703	4700	In the end, the media is largely for entertainment	29
32704	4700	It provides numerous shows and articles, with a huge array of topics	30
32705	4700	This goes to show that if one should find something offensive, it doesn't mean they have to rip it off the shelves and complain	31
32706	4700	it simply means they have the opportunity look elsewhere	32
32707	4701	@CAPS1 are many prespectives on censorship in our country	0
32708	4701	Thats just how our country is we have different oppinions on everything we do	1
32709	4701	But we have to live with it, @CAPS1 are many different prespectives that come from old, young, parents, and children	2
32710	4701	In libraries @CAPS1 are some books,music, etc that @MONTH1 be offensive to people	3
32711	4701	But we all have different oppinions therefore we can never listen to one pupil	4
32712	4701	Or it would start a fight between people that disagree with him/her	5
32713	4701	I think people that go into the library should be mature about what goes on in @CAPS1 otherwise they shouldn't be in @CAPS1 looking at whatever they are wanting to read about	6
32714	4701	The library is opened for the public and has lots of knowledge it shares with us	7
32715	4701	But if we get rid of all the censorship then it denies people knowledge	8
32716	4701	The books that they would get rid of would be because of the children	9
32717	4701	Because parents don't want children to look @NUM1+ material that is not appropriate for them so they try to keep it hidden	10
32718	4701	I think we should keep censorship around because it would deny knowledge to people if we did not keep it	11
32719	4701	And we should remind parents that some things in the library is not suitable for childrens eyes and let them be responsable for what thier children look at.	12
32720	4702	I do not think that a random stranger should have the right to decide what books to allow in a public library	0
32721	4702	If they have a problem with certain material in certiain books they should bring it to the attention of the library	1
32722	4702	The auther who wrote that book has the freedom of speech, and they are allowed to write anything that they would like to write	2
32723	4702	If somebody did not want their children looking at a book, or reading that book, then they should just tell their child to stay away from it, and if they raised their child properly, he or she should respect those boundries that the parents have set	3
32724	4702	However, I think there should be a line drawn about what is too graphic to be displayed at a public library	4
32725	4702	Some magazines that contain graphic material are very educational, such as @ORGANIZATION1	5
32726	4702	On the other hand, I am not saying that we should be lining shelves with @CAPS1 magazines either	6
32727	4702	There is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures, and those that educate them about sex and explicit material	7
32728	4702	It is the adults job to protect their children from material such as that	8
32729	4702	But they can do it in another way, other than taking the book off the shelf	9
32730	4702	Even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity, the concerned parent cannot just take actions into their own hands	10
32731	4702	The owner of the library is the adult that gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library, not the customers	11
32732	4702	I think that if you are offended by a certain book at a library, you should bring it to the attention of the owner, or simply go to a different library	12
32733	4702	If the owner refuses to remove the item from the shelf and the material offends you that much, you could go to court and plead your case to the judge	13
32734	4702	But you have no right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to you.	14
32735	4703	When picking a book, music, movie, and magazines from the library it's always a hard decision because you @MONTH1 be like me and want to read more than one book at a time	0
32736	4703	Books that are found offensive are more interesting than just plain boring books	1
32737	4703	So why would anybody take books off the shelf for being offensive	2
32738	4703	When children pick books from the library you want to make sure their kids books and you @MONTH1 also want to check to see if their educational	3
32739	4703	You definitely wouldn't want a little kid getting ahold of an adult book or a book that is found offensive in some way	4
32740	4703	So have an adult section and a kids section	5
32741	4703	When we walk into a library full of books, theirs a huge variety of any kind of books	6
32742	4703	We would lower the use of going to the library if books were takin off the shelves because their wouldn't be any use of going	7
32743	4703	If your not going to find a book there, why go to the library anymore	8
32744	4703	The last reason to not take books off the shelfs is people that can not afford to buy a book from anywhere obviously come to the library to borrow a book	9
32745	4703	So taking books away would just limit their learning and would not be very benificial to them	10
32746	4703	The only reason that I would find it okay to take offensive books and anything else off shelves is for childrens sake and safety	11
32747	4703	If the library's are thinking about taking offensive books off shelves, they should have a public vote to see what everyone else thinks about it	12
32748	4703	If they decide to take books off the shelves, why not just have an adult section in the library	13
32749	4703	Anybody that is @NUM1 years of age or older could be in there	14
32750	4703	So make finding a book easier and don't take our offensive books completely away from us	15
32751	4704	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Katherine Paterson	0
32752	4704	Katherine Paterson is an auther who, like the quote from her, believes that some books should never reach the hands of children	1
32753	4704	Does everyone believe the same way,no	2
32754	4704	I am one of those few people who believe that no one should have the right to remove a book simply because they find the book offensive	3
32755	4704	Your an old fashion woman who believes in old fashion ideals such as no cursing or violence	4
32756	4704	You, as this woman, pick up a book and read the first page, on this page you see cursing and deside to remove all books with violence or cursing from the library	5
32757	4704	The library soon becomes half empty because of one woman and her belifs	6
32758	4704	Belifs are a wonderful thing ouside of reading and can make you who you want to be	7
32759	4704	Books do not, in my opinion, have belifs	8
32760	4704	This is true for some books but a book where someone runs from danger or flys into the sky, those are not belifs those are dreams and no one can crush dreams offensive or not	9
32761	4704	I compair books to dreams simply for the fact that they are dreams, the dreams of the authers who wrote them and wanted to share that dream with the world	10
32762	4704	Telling a person they can not publish there book simply because another person finds it affensive is telling the auther your dream is offensive	11
32763	4704	If you do not want your child to share this book of dreams then do not let your child pick up the book	12
32764	4704	You are the parent of the child who picks up this book then you can protect it from the offensive danger it holds like you protect it from the dangers of strangers in the real world	13
32765	4704	Authers do not always write for the sake of everyone	14
32766	4704	Authers do not write for one woman, one man, one child, authers write for those who share a similer dream	15
32767	4704	If you do not share the same dream as the auther that is fine, no one is forcing you to share in there sometimes dark and sometimes amazing dreams	16
32768	4704	Authers write because they wish to write, to express themselfs in ways only words and storys can	17
32769	4704	Do not shun a book because one thing in it offends you, @CAPS1 a book is @CAPS1 someones dream	18
32770	4704	In short you would never crush your childs dreams	19
32771	4704	If your child wants to grow up and be a fireman you do not tell them that it is offensive to people so they cant	20
32772	4704	Why would you do something to someone elses dream who you have never met	21
32773	4704	Be a bigger person and allow that person to live there dream through a story	22
32774	4704	No matter the level of offiense you do not have to pick up the book and read it	23
32775	4704	the number one way to not be affended by a book that @MONTH1 affend you is to never read the book to start with.	24
32776	4705	Certain material that are made to offend people should be removed from shelves everywhere	0
32777	4705	I am against any material that are offensive to someone or something else	1
32778	4705	The three main reasons I am against this is because it is wrong to offend others, offending others can lead to personal issues, and offending others or something else will eventually tire out	2
32779	4705	To simply write a book or a magazine, or make a movie just to offend someone or something is wrong	3
32780	4705	People should always treat others the way that they would like to be treated	4
32781	4705	For someone to make negative lyrics about a person or something says something about the person who made that song	5
32782	4705	Maybe that person has personal issues	6
32783	4705	In order for that person to ignore their personal issues, they make fun of someone else	7
32784	4705	Offending other people can lead to personal problems	8
32785	4705	How	9
32786	4705	If someone steadily talks about you or, on a daily basis, offends you, people can get depressed	10
32787	4705	They can start believing that they are nothing	11
32788	4705	I remember a girl in the eighth grade told everyone that I was a 'garden tool' and that I would do anything for a piece of change	12
32789	4705	She also made a song, taunting me everyday about how I looked	13
32790	4705	She actually recorded it and passed it out at school	14
32791	4705	People heard it, and like followers, they started taunting me, too	15
32792	4705	I soon became depressed	16
32793	4705	I got so bad to the point that I was suicidal	17
32794	4705	I thought the world would be a better place without me	18
32795	4705	I had to go see a shrink to get over those thoughts	19
32796	4705	What other people do to you or say about you can have a bad effect on them	20
32797	4705	Last but not least, people will eventually get tired of hearing bad things about someone	21
32798	4705	The victim will get tired of being teased or talked about	22
32799	4705	People would stop listening to that negative garbage	23
32800	4705	If people stop supporting that degrading stuff, then the author wouldn't have anything to write about	24
32801	4705	The singer wouldn't have anything to sing about	25
32802	4705	Their career will have gone down the drain because there is no future in offending others	26
32803	4705	There are many reasons why offensive materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries, stores, and everywhere else	27
32804	4705	These negative comments will get nowhere in life	28
32805	4705	As I brought out in my body, it's simply wrong to offend others, it can lead to personal issues, and it will eventually tire out or get old	29
32806	4705	Nothing good comes from making people feel bad	30
32807	4705	So once again, these negative materials should be abolished everywhere.	31
32808	4706	In my personal opinon I think that those books that have things that you don't want to read or you think are offensive should stay	0
32809	4706	It's not like that person that is offended by it has to read it	1
32810	4706	Say you are in the library and you see a book that you think offends you	2
32811	4706	You think to your self that book should be removed from the library just because you think it is offensive, but you have to think in other peoples shoes	3
32812	4706	Just becaus you think a book is offensive doesn't mean that everyone else will think it is	4
32813	4706	That is why they have age groups and grade levels that are set up so a kid who likes picture books will not get stuck with a book that has curse words or other things that are meant for adults	5
32814	4706	Same concept with movies, magazines, music, and etc	6
32815	4706	Take this for example	7
32816	4706	I was walking through the library when I saw a book called @CAPS1 the @ORGANIZATION1, and I thought to myself that looks like a stupid book and I wouldn't want to read it	8
32817	4706	I think that they should throw this book away	9
32818	4706	Now lets think does that sound fair	10
32819	4706	Maybe that is some kids favorite book and when he comes in there the next day it is gone	11
32820	4706	What about this, lets say you go in to look for your favorite book and you find out that someone found it offensive or someone just didn't like it as much as you did so they threw it away	12
32821	4706	Doesn't seem to fair does it	13
32822	4706	In conclusion that is what i think about removing books that are offensive or some people just don't like	14
32823	4706	I think they should leave it on there because we shouldn't remove it based on our personal opinon.	15
32824	4707	There's bad, and good books out there	0
32825	4707	Some people find different books affensive, to what they do	1
32826	4707	Other's like the books that other people dislike	2
32827	4707	In a way books are both bad and good	3
32828	4707	Good, because people start to read better after reading a lot, and bad because a lot of people dislike to read	4
32829	4707	I think that when you go in a library there should be impropet books for people to read	5
32830	4707	Children go in library's, what if they pick up a bad book and form horriable habits	6
32831	4707	Children, and adults have very different views on what to read	7
32832	4707	Kids want to read fairytale stories, etc	8
32833	4707	Adult's on otherhand enjoy mystery storys about murder, and such	9
32834	4707	Yes, library's can let people check out any book they find interesting	10
32835	4707	But, what if that book is bad for there children to see lying around	11
32836	4707	It's simple if you make sure you don't leave your books just lying anywhere, kid's wouldn't form bad habits, or discover anything there not suppose to know	12
32837	4707	Kid's are noises, and they will try to read your books, or see something bad on a magizine	13
32838	4707	In library's, there is the children's section, and the adult section	14
32839	4707	That helps in some way's, but your child can still find that bad book, etc at home	15
32840	4707	Parents can keep from this for the safety of there childrens thought's, or qeustions about that certain book, etc that they found	16
32841	4707	It's good to just put thing's away when your done, and keep every bad book, etc out of your childs react	17
32842	4707	Books are bad, and good	18
32843	4707	You can find the information you need, or something you really don't want to read about, or see	19
32844	4707	Books have stuff that we sometime's need to know, and want to know more about	20
32845	4707	If your kid finds a misleading book, make sure they didn't read it, or look at it	21
32846	4707	and just hide it away from them	22
32847	4707	In the end, the problem will be solved.	23
32848	4708	Censorship      @CAPS1 you are trying to find the right book, music, movie, magizine, you @MONTH1 come across some interesting ones	0
32849	4708	Should libraries ban certain books just because of some contend on one page	1
32850	4708	The person has that ability to read that book or not	2
32851	4708	Banning books has been a huge problem in today's society and needs to be stopped	3
32852	4708	People should be old enough to choose a book that they enjoy and not have to worry about, does this libary have the book that I want	4
32853	4708	They should not have to think that way @CAPS1 going to a library	5
32854	4708	@CAPS1 you think of some of the worst books out there, who would want to read those anyway	6
32855	4708	Many books that people think are bad just have a terrible word on one page	7
32856	4708	They do not think that they are banning a perfectly good book for others	8
32857	4708	@PERSON2's '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' was a big upror wheather or not to put the book on the shelfs	9
32858	4708	The book intailed the @CAPS4 word, and some people were not pleased in this sequence	10
32859	4708	The book was very well written and just had a few bad words	11
32860	4708	Should a few bad words keep a book from being a prize winner	12
32861	4708	The book was such a great story and should be read by many people and should not be kept in a storage room in boxes	13
32862	4708	There are many ways to keep a certain age from gettting a certain book	14
32863	4708	The library could put those certain books in @CAPS5 own part of the library	15
32864	4708	Keeping the books in a different part of the library might be a better suited way instead of banning the books altogether	16
32865	4708	The book still will be censored to be in that section or not, but we still will have those wonderful books that we all love so much	17
32866	4708	What if there was a great informative book about how to do a certain task and no one knew how to do it	18
32867	4708	That book contained bad language, should the health and knowledge of the world go down because of some bad material in a book, that could help us in the near future	19
32868	4708	Authors have just the same right as we do	20
32869	4708	They should get a say in wheather @CAPS5 own book is liable to be on the shelfs	21
32870	4708	The government should not get all the say in this series matter in hand	22
32871	4708	The community and the author that writes it should get more of the say then anyone else	23
32872	4708	@CAPS1 an author writes a novel they think of the great content they are putting into this great piece of art not thinking of, is this suitable for children to read	24
32873	4708	The author just loves to write and should not have to think of all the concerns that they should just not worry about	25
32874	4708	There is this book we read this year called '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 Are @CAPS7 @CAPS8'	26
32875	4708	This book had language that I do not think would be suitable for others in some content that was in the novel	27
32876	4708	Now do I think the the novel should be banned from a library	28
32877	4708	No, because it used the words in a very nonviolent way	29
32878	4708	@CAPS1 reading it I felt that I was not harmed by the content and neither were any of my fellow classmates	30
32879	4708	@PERSON1 was the author of this book and I thought she did an excellent job of writing this piece of literature	31
32880	4708	So the next time you think of banning a book think of all the warm hearts you could be crushing	32
32881	4709	In my opinion everyone should have a right to go to the library and get whatever book, magazine, movie, and music they what	0
32882	4709	People go to the library for a lot of reason computers, books, etc	1
32883	4709	Also having a public library comes handy for people that don't have a computer at home	2
32884	4709	It's a public library you should be able to go there an find about anything you need book or movie wise	3
32885	4709	Everyone has differnt likes an interests about their books or movies, and i'm sure people go to the library an expect them to have what they are looking for	4
32886	4709	Some people do go to the library an not find what there looking for	5
32887	4709	Then people get mad an upset cause they figured the library would have it an they don't	6
32888	4709	But yes I think that there should be any kind of magazine, movie, or book at the library that you need	7
32889	4709	I mean it's a library they should have it all	8
32890	4709	Also people have the right to go get whatever book, or movie they want	9
32891	4709	It's called freedom everyone is diffrent and everyone likes diffrent things	10
32892	4709	There has been a few times I have went to our library to find books or movies an they didn't have them	11
32893	4709	You would think that a library would have a book or movie over trying to potty train a toddler, but they didn't	12
32894	4709	I think that they should have any an every kind of book, magazine, an movie you want at the library	13
32895	4709	Yeah some people @MONTH1 take offense to it but who cares obviously they don't want it so leave it an go get what you want	14
32896	4709	Just cause you don't like it don't mean other people don't	15
32897	4709	So no I don't think just cause some people don't like them they should be removed from the shelves	16
32898	4709	So no i absolutely do not think that any books, movies, magazines should be removed from the shevles	17
32899	4709	You are who  you are an you like what you like it shoudn't matter what other people think about it as long as it's what you like	18
32900	4709	So in my opinion the library should be a good use to everyone, and leave the books, magazines, etc	19
32901	4709	on the shevles for the people who do like to read or watch them	20
32902	4710	I think that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	0
32903	4710	People enjoy books with offensive language or content, people love to feel the engery or tone of the writer	1
32904	4710	I personal love offensive langauge if everything was censored it would feel like everything is dull and fake	2
32905	4710	'Your @CAPS1****** cheating on me @CAPS2****', @CAPS3 you feel the wow in body	3
32906	4710	Now look if i censor it 'Your cheating on me @PERSON1' it felt dull and if you got cheated on before you probably thought of ten different thing you would have said differently and uncensored	4
32907	4710	If your a parent who don't want their child reading or seeing this you should try to teach or keep your child away from this	5
32908	4710	Instead of removing why not just move them to an @NUM1+ section of the library	6
32909	4710	The @NUM1+ section will warn kids and parent what their getting into if their parent don't want them to be exposed to reality them then that means they should not be in that area	7
32910	4710	libraries are usually divided into section but if not if you ask local libraries if they divide adult and children books into section of the libraries then they should tell you.	8
32911	4711	Censorship in the @CAPS1     @CAPS2, what is offensive to some @MONTH1 not be to others	0
32912	4711	So how do we know when expressing ourselves in an artistic manner that we've gone to far	1
32913	4711	We don't and thats why censorship is such a controversial topic	2
32914	4711	In the music industry recently there has been messages in songs and music videos that aren't the best suited for teenagers	3
32915	4711	Being a teenager is a time of constant turmoil in one's life, you are required to make decisions that will define you as a person	4
32916	4711	When songs out there are about drug use and other crimes teens see them as cool things and follow along cause they see them as everyday activities that can do no harm but little do they know that they are wrecking their life by doing this, so I somewhat agree with censorship in that kind of thing	5
32917	4711	In literature and art things take a more serious tone than in music and other media	6
32918	4711	With literature it's about conveying ones thoughts and feelings about a story or other subject	7
32919	4711	In art you express yourself vissually on a canvas or abstractly through other materials and forms, but in both ways you express your feelings and emotins	8
32920	4711	So censoring these would in turn censor one voice and emotions	9
32921	4711	When you take away a man's voice and emotions you are left with an empty shell of a person who will never know life to the fullest	10
32922	4711	As time has changed I have found that people have also changed	11
32923	4711	When @PERSON1 uses the '@CAPS3-word' in some of his literary works it didn't offend people at the time, but now times have changed	12
32924	4711	Now it's not ok that @PERSON1 used this word but on the other hand it's ok for rappers and others to say it every other word in their music	13
32925	4711	so how do we know what's offensive and what's not	14
32926	4711	well it's all from the reader, listener, or viewer's point of view	15
32927	4711	These days parents try to sheild their children from the outside world and make it seem that it's all rainbows and butterflies by censoring things the children might be subject to read, hear, or see in their day to day lives	16
32928	4711	This does not solve the problems in the world there will always be war, crime, and death no matter how hard we try to stop it as long as there's 'good' there will always be 'bad'	17
32929	4711	All loyalties aside in my honest opinion I believe censorship in the @CAPS1 is a bad idea and will never work to solve actual problems with the world	18
32930	4711	It will just cover them up just like the dialouge or image they so badly want to go away.	19
32931	4712	Although it is a new day and age where damand is high for elctronic books, hard back and paper back books are not obsolete quite yet	0
32932	4712	Many people still like the old tradition of traveling to libraries, and starting the quest for the perfect book	1
32933	4712	Also, with the economy at a downfall, it is the cheaper way to go	2
32934	4712	But the big question is, can people find everything they desire at their local library	3
32935	4712	For some people that maynot be the case because of library censoring	4
32936	4712	Yes it is true that many libraries now censore many things that they would think would be inapproite for childrens eyes	5
32937	4712	I agree that some things should not be displayed on shelves at libraries	6
32938	4712	Although some adults or teens desire more mature actricles, these things should not be avaible for children to view	7
32939	4712	One of the most loyal customers to the library are children and their parents	8
32940	4712	Parents do not want their children to be exposed to explicet materials at that young of an age	9
32941	4712	Also if libraries lose young families as customers, that would be almost half their clientel gone down the drain	10
32942	4712	So next time when you want to buy something that maybe to mature for children, you might want to reconsider going to the library	11
32943	4712	Instead go to a book store and buy whatever you need there	12
32944	4712	Keep children in a safe, innocent environment	13
32945	4713	Do I believe certain material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive	0
32946	4713	No, just because a book or song or magazine article or movie is offensive does not mean that we should have the right to take it off the shelves	1
32947	4713	Sure we have a right to remove that book but there are a lot things that are going to offend people	2
32948	4713	Just because someone comes across an offensive book at the library doesn't mean that they should have to go through so much work to get it removed off the shelf	3
32949	4713	Its not worth the trouble for just a book that you could just simply look past and look at other books	4
32950	4713	If it was possible for anyone to just take a book off a shelf because they thought it was offensive we would have a lot of empy book stores	5
32951	4713	Because face it people can and will be offended easily if something they believe, like religion, is being made fun of in a book that they had read about	6
32952	4713	We all get offended but just move on from it and find something different	7
32953	4713	We are not forced to read that book or listen to that song or look at the magazine	8
32954	4713	We have a choice and the choice can be to move on and read or look at something different, more positive, or go through the process to get it removed and taken off the shelf	9
32955	4713	You never know someone else might think that maybe that article in that magazine was benefitial or relating	10
32956	4713	So it should not be up to one person, but if a whole community has a problem with a book then I can see removing it can be an option	11
32957	4714	I think that some books in the library some people might take offensive	0
32958	4714	But some of those books have a meaning behind it	1
32959	4714	I think theres one book out there that alot of people love to read, and that is @CAPS1 @CAPS2	2
32960	4714	The book uses the '@CAPS3' word alot and many people take that offensive, but why	3
32961	4714	There was a big arguement about alot of book companies changing the word in the book to @CAPS4 @CAPS5	4
32962	4714	From my perspective I think it should stay the same	5
32963	4714	Why change that now	6
32964	4714	Many english teachers use that book because it talks about a white boy named @CAPS6 saving @PERSON1	7
32965	4714	Its not being used in a bad why at all just using the terms of how they did back in the olden days	8
32966	4714	The book is strong and shows readers a strong aspect in life	9
32967	4714	Yes you shouldn't go around saying that word, but also not change it now, after its been out for along time to the public	10
32968	4714	The book would not bring the same meaning as it would if it is  being changed	11
32969	4715	Katherine Paterson wrote about the true impact of censoring what is put in a library	0
32970	4715	In the quote she mentions how if what every single person finds offensive is removed, eventually nothing is left	1
32971	4715	The question of, 'Should library content be censored?' is a largely debated question	2
32972	4715	There is a simple answer to this question	3
32973	4715	It should not be censored	4
32974	4715	Views on what should be censored and why, vary based on type of person and their background	5
32975	4715	As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	6
32976	4715	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else	7
32977	4715	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @PERSON2 made the observation that most people would not think far enough to realize	8
32978	4715	The most logical thing is to not censor what works are put into libraries	9
32979	4715	As was previously stated, once every person pulls what they deem should not be on shelves, the library will be but a building without books	10
32980	4715	To keep children from getting into certain types of literature, movies, and music, libraries could have a section set off within the adult section for these works	11
32981	4715	Many public libraries do not even have these types of items that would be so highly disputed for the simple fact that if the library does not even carry it, they do not have to worry about issues	12
32982	4715	These public institutions are working for the best of the visitors, and if there are works needing to be kept from the childrens' section, there is no doubt that this would be taken care of appropriately	13
32983	4715	The topic of censorship is a very touchy subject to start with	14
32984	4715	This goes back to the debate of what exactly should be censored	15
32985	4715	The problem with what is 'explicit,' is that there is no black and white line	16
32986	4715	Does a book become inappropriate because a teen girl becomes pregnant within the pages	17
32987	4715	In some eyes, the fact that a teenager got inpregnated within a book makes it inappropriate, but critics will argue that this is life and to shield the world from reality makes us all blind	18
32988	4715	Proper instillation of morals and values on the homefront will help young citizens make intelligent choices, but expecting the world to censor itself for each individual is something that would never be possible	19
32989	4715	Censorship in libraries is a touchy subject, but like Katherine Paterson said, if every person in the world removed what they thought inappropriate, there would be no books left	20
32990	4715	This truth being stated, censorship in libraries should be stopped before every book is gone	21
32991	4715	As the world turns, life cannot be stopped because bad or inappropriate things exist	22
32992	4715	It can only be learned that yes, these things @MONTH1 exist, but by using better judgement the whole world can get along just fine without trying to remove everything 'bad.'	23
32993	4718	If I found a book that I thought was innapropiate for others to read, I would ask the librarian to check into to see what she thinks about the book(s)	0
32994	4718	If she believed they were offensive, then she could remove the book(s) without any questions being asked	1
32995	4718	If she was in the middle on a book and didn't know whether she should remove, she could take a vote or tally on that book and then go from there to see if it did needed removed	2
32996	4718	The only way I would find a book to be offensive is if it had pictures that were not appropiate for people to look at and it also depends on how old you are	3
32997	4718	Another offensive object would be too many words that involved foul language and or racism	4
32998	4718	If i found a movie that was offensive, I would just ask that it would be moved to a place that only mature adults should watch or some teenagers	5
32999	4718	My opinion can't remove an object from its place unless there were multiple complaints about the book or movie and ect	6
33000	4718	Some movies and books should be removed from shelves because younger kids get a hold of these movies ans watch them and then go out into the real world and do these bad actions that was on the film	7
33001	4718	For example, if the movie/book was about drugs, then some kids would think it was alright for them to do because they  saw it on tv	8
33002	4718	Some kids even get killed because they go out and try these dumb ideas they got from the book and or movie	9
33003	4718	But the parents also play a role by letting their kid watch these, I think if they would watch what their children do, then some of this won't happen	10
33004	4718	Music is another big thing that is becoming more and more out of control with offensive subjects	11
33005	4718	There is more foul language in music as it progresses	12
33006	4718	@NUM1 years ago, it wasn't that bad, but it's getting worse	13
33007	4718	I think some music should be banned because of the violence and sexual content it describes on the music	14
33008	4718	Some of the music I listen to, I just want to run it over with my vehicle because the whole song was about drugs, sexual content and or violence	15
33009	4718	I don't even know why an artist would want to write a song about bad content because they know younger people will hear it	16
33010	4718	I think offensive music has an effect on the violence that actually occurs in today's society because there might be some racism	17
33011	4718	I'm not trying to blame the artists or say it their fault, but I think they should think twice about their songs before they release it so everyone can listen to it	18
33012	4718	Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but some things should not be on the shelves for our kids and children to listen to and or watch	19
33013	4718	I think there will be something done, but it will take time	20
33014	4719	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf	0
33015	4719	But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly yhe same right and so does everyone else	1
33016	4719	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' states Katherine Paterson	2
33017	4719	Books and movies all over the world are being censored and removed from libraries, day after day, due to their explicit content	3
33018	4719	I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelf, and that they are there for a genuine purpose	4
33019	4719	Explicit objects should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, children's parents have a right to exclude the material from the child's life, and some material can be useful in life and someone @MONTH1 learn from @CAPS3	5
33020	4719	Children everywhere are being influenced by books, magazines, movies, and even songs	6
33021	4719	Some people argue that these harmful materials are affecting how kids behave and act	7
33022	4719	I, however, believe that a child should have superb morals and values to know right from wrong	8
33023	4719	For example, if a child happens to see a pornography magazine lingering on a shelf of their local grocerey store, they should know that no matter how temping @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, that buying that pornography magazine would be wrong	9
33024	4719	From birth, parents are constantly teaching their children what is right and what is wrong	10
33025	4719	They attempt to teach their children the basics: that drugs, alcohol, and smoking will corrupt their health	11
33026	4719	@CAPS3 doesn't matter if a child sees someone doing drugs in a movie or hears a song about a teenager getting drunk	12
33027	4719	They should not be influenced by this because by using their logic, they should infer that what is being read or listened to isn't always the right thing to do	13
33028	4719	Everyday, children's parents have the right to exclude harmful material from a child's life	14
33029	4719	After all, they are a superior figure in the child's life, and the child will always look up to them to lead the way	15
33030	4719	At most local theaters now, you have to be seventeen to see a rated '@CAPS1' movie	16
33031	4719	A lot of theaters allow a child to view a rated '@CAPS1' movie, no matter what age, as long as they have a parent or a gardian present	17
33032	4719	Movie theaters feel that by having a child's parent there would help immensly because the parent is choosing for their child to watch that particular movie, instead of the child viewing the movie without their permission	18
33033	4719	If a parent doesn't want their child to view a raunchy movie, they can simple say, 'NO!' @CAPS3's as simple as that	19
33034	4719	If a parent feels that a movie is decent for a child to watch, then go ahead and let them watch that material	20
33035	4719	Parental agreement should always be a main factor in determined whether or not a child could view a particular movie or read a certain provacative book	21
33036	4719	If all offensive books and movies were removed from the shelf, we would be living in a structured world where no one would learn any more than what they already knew	22
33037	4719	Life @MONTH1 possibly become rather boring	23
33038	4719	Although, some people @MONTH1 find books and songs to be offensive, others @MONTH1 contribute from these materials	24
33039	4719	A child @MONTH1 pick up a book, start reading, and discover some disturbing thoughts that they never would have encountered beyond picking up that book	25
33040	4719	They would never of learned such things	26
33041	4719	Reading information like this, creates a move advanced society	27
33042	4719	Adults and children are becoming smarter each day	28
33043	4719	Any parent would agree that they would love any opprotunity to arise for their children to become smarter and more wiser than they already were	29
33044	4719	Songs, movies, books, and magazines could provide that for their child	30
33045	4719	Reading is an escape from a jungle of wild monkies for some children	31
33046	4719	They @MONTH1 use a book to get away from the struggles of everyday life and get lost within its lively pages	32
33047	4719	If more and more books are being censored and thrown out, that equates to less books a child could have an opprotunity to discover	33
33048	4719	I once read that even @CAPS4 classes all over the world are not allowing their students to read The @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 @CAPS7	34
33049	4719	The teachers find this book to be too inappropriate for their students	35
33050	4719	This is unfair for any student, because this novel is inspiring and life changing, so they are definitely missing out	36
33051	4719	Also, movies and songs are provided for one's pure entertainment, so @CAPS3 shouldn't always matter if its crude	37
33052	4719	A child or young adult @MONTH1 learn things that they never thought imaginable through provided public materials	38
33053	4719	In conclusion, books, magaizines, movies, and music are one's individual way of expressing themself	39
33054	4719	They should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, parents have the right to exclude offensive material from a child's life, and material, not matter how crude @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, can be used as a learning tool	40
33055	4719	If more and more material is being removed from our local libraries, @CAPS3's almost like authors are being punished for being unique	41
33056	4719	Our children won't be exposed to as much, therefore, they won't learn and grow from @CAPS3	42
33057	4719	Do you really want our society to prohibit intelectual thinking just because they think certain material @MONTH1 be offensive	43
33058	4719	Think about @CAPS3	44
33059	4720	I believe that profanity has a good side and a bad side	0
33060	4720	The good side is profanity is it give books, music, and movies taste and texteure it shows how a person feels most times it's anger	1
33061	4720	Profanity also can change a person behavior, by the way people talk and act	2
33062	4720	I personally think that profanity is a good and bad i like it in music and movies but i hate it when people talk trash	3
33063	4720	I think they should take it off the shelves depending on the person age for example age three and thirteen books should not contain profanity but ages fourteen and up can	4
33064	4720	The reason why people should take it off the shelves is beacuse kids should have a healthy and profanity free life	5
33065	4720	They should have a a good development turds learning	6
33066	4720	Books and other intertaiment should have no profanity because kids at a young age learn easly and if they take in the bad actions of others they will be bad themselfs	7
33067	4720	The reason why people should be aware of this problem is if you don't like profanity dont buy it	8
33068	4720	Also keep out of kids reach	9
33069	4720	The main reason why people swears is because of movies and songs it changes a person dramaticly	10
33070	4720	Talking with profanity in your mouth can change your life but not having a good job getting in jail raising up bad kids that learn from the parents mistakes	11
33071	4720	In a @CAPS1 profanity is good for movies it gives it action and drama	12
33072	4720	profanity is words that are most times negative expressing anger and rudeness	13
33073	4720	We have a @CAPS2 full of profanity this is like a wide spred deases	14
33074	4720	Passing on from people to kids to their kids	15
33075	4720	I have expeariance this the hard way beacuse im chinese and i came to the united states back in @DATE1, i did not know any english	16
33076	4720	People would cuss at me all the time the could all be avoided if we didnt have any profanity in our daily usage of books, music, and movies	17
33077	4720	I have learned alot about people by the way they talk letting me know who to stay away from	18
33078	4720	We should keep profanity but limit it from kids	19
33079	4720	Profanity is like ice cream people wants it and other dont	20
33080	4720	People could make there choice of putting themselfs in a profanity free life	21
33081	4720	people can do what they think is the right thing to do	22
33082	4720	Taking it off the shelves for kids is what i think is the right thing to do but not adults	23
33083	4720	Due to profanity people tend to put themselfs in truble	24
33084	4720	For example some people in the use gets pulled over by a officer for a low cost speeding ticket but then they would swear at the officer putting them selfs in more truble this could all be avoided if he didnt have ever said anything	25
33085	4720	Profanity could also make a good motivational speech i know this beacuse im on the @LOCATION1 football team	26
33086	4720	Before every game our coach would motivate us by giving us a speech to get us pumped up with profanity in it	27
33087	4720	So in the end what im saying is porfanity should say but keep it out of reach of kids for books parents dont buy them if you dont want your kids to see them	28
33088	4720	Movies read the lable on the back of the @CAPS3 and see the agae limit and for profanity	29
33089	4720	Lock up the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that have profanity in it so your kids have no acess to them	30
33090	4720	If you dont want any part of profanity you can make yourself to stayway from it	31
33091	4720	We all know the there is nothing you can do about others useing profanity just dont use it yourself and stay clean do what you think is right	32
33092	4721	All materials in a library are for the public	0
33093	4721	This is why we have public libraries	1
33094	4721	Children are most likely with an adult when they go to a library and are normaly looking for books or activities that they would enjoy at their age	2
33095	4721	If a costomer in a library finds a book or item that they find offensive then it most likely was not an accident	3
33096	4721	Materials in libraries are for the public and should not be taken away just because a few find it offensive	4
33097	4721	Children are very suspicious in libraries because they know that adult material is also in the library	5
33098	4721	This is where an adult comes in and supervises the child	6
33099	4721	Some parents don't mind that children see these images or read innapropriate information, but on the other hand some parents do	7
33100	4721	If someone comes across information that would be offensive they were most likely looking for it and are aware of where it is	8
33101	4721	Everyone in a library has the right to take or read what they want	9
33102	4721	There is no sign outside the door that says only certain ages of people can visit certain areas of the store	10
33103	4721	It is the parent or gardians decision to allow or not alow their child to visit the more innapropriate areas of the store	11
33104	4721	Everyone has different rules and those rules are to be followed, but it is not the libraries job to keep track and watch those children to make sure they stay in their designated area	12
33105	4721	There is a place for everything in a library and most of the locations are pretty obvious as to what kind of information is held there	13
33106	4721	For instance, more adult and innapropriate material is located in the back of the store	14
33107	4721	Adult matter is held back there to make it more private and harder for little children to discover and to be alittle more private to people who are reading it	15
33108	4721	Childrens' books and movies are usually loctaed in the front of the store so it draws their attention more	16
33109	4721	Children @MONTH1 never know what else is in the store if they dont go looking for it	17
33110	4721	Children should be acompanied by an adult if the adult believes their child would wander off looking for innapropriate materal	18
33111	4721	Other material that could be offensive could not only be to children, it could be offensive to different races or cultures as well	19
33112	4721	Also if a person finds that information, they were most likely looking for it	20
33113	4721	Everything is labeled in a library and something doesn't just pop up out of nowhere if you where not looking for it	21
33114	4721	Overall material in a store is public and for anyone who comes into the store	22
33115	4721	Children should be watched if they are suspicous and wander in the library	23
33116	4721	If someone does not want to find this informatin or think it would be offensive, then they should not go near the area which it is located	24
33117	4723	When it comes to my idea of having censorship in the libraries around the world I believe that there are cases when there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that should not be on the shelves	0
33118	4723	Not only are there things in the books, etc	1
33119	4723	that children might not understand and take the wrong way, but there are also things that adults of any age might take offensivley as well	2
33120	4723	In my years of being in school I have encountered many books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that I have thought should never even end up on the shelves of libraries	3
33121	4723	For one example, I was looking through the library one day for a book that I would be able to do my book report on, and just from reading the back of the book I learned that this book involved drugs, sex, and many other things that I thought would be inappropriate for someone even my age to read	4
33122	4723	For the librarians and other school workers involved in the buying of books, I am sure that they never even think twice about a book being offered to young children and teenagers that it would be inapropriate or offensive, but in almost all cases every single book has something that would prove them wrong	5
33123	4723	Also I have encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was said to be a wonderful book even for someone under the age of twelve	6
33124	4723	In my own experience from reading the book I would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to	7
33125	4723	Not only are there books that I have found in the library to be inappropriate and offensive but also many magazines, movies, and music	8
33126	4723	There is usually not alot of music that would involve offensive behavior in libraries but in some cases there are	9
33127	4723	For example, I new someone that was doing a report on pop culture and while researching the music and listening to the music that the library provided, they found it to be very offensive and inappropriate for himself to hear	10
33128	4723	Other than that I have found that movies and magazines are just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive	11
33129	4723	I myself would think that teenagers above the age of @NUM1 would understand the meaning of being mature	12
33130	4723	I have observed that most teenagers and even children that read offensive books end up having a behavior that most parents and teachers do not approve of	13
33131	4723	When it comes time for my children to reach this age I would hope that they would never act like some of the kids I have seen or spoken with	14
33132	4723	After understanding how much inappropriate/offensive behavior there is in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I not only recommend that they evaluate the type of books, and other resources that are offered in libraries, but also I have realized that I sure hope they get this matter taken care of right away	15
33133	4723	I not only feel that parents around the world would feel the same as I do, but I know for a fact that I would never want my children to read books that I have read or been offered through my high school library	16
33134	4723	This is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even teenagers	17
33135	4723	The world is becomming more and more violent every single day, and it is up to the future children to solve this problem	18
33136	4723	In a sitaution like this, we do not want the minds of the youth to be infested with offensive and inappropriate behavior	19
33137	4723	Let this be a step in the right direction	20
33138	4724	I belive that every one has thier right to thier own opinion	0
33139	4724	If a parrent does not think that thier kid should do some thing dont let them	1
33140	4724	It kind of reminds me of how people are aginst hunting if you dont like it dont do it	2
33141	4724	If every one would express thier own opinion the world would be alot better place	3
33142	4724	If I dont like @PERSON1 and I tell @PERSON1 i dont like him @PERSON1 knows I dont like him so he wont talk to me any more	4
33143	4724	So in a bigger picture if @LOCATION1 tells @LOCATION2 that we dont like thim they will not try to make friends with us any more	5
33144	4724	so if everyone would speak thier mind the world would be alot better	6
33145	4724	If a parent does not like some thing like a type of music, movie, or even book and they express that to thier kid they will learn that that thing is bad	7
33146	4724	My dad tought me that it was fine to kill animals only if I am willing to eat them so that seams fine with me but other people might not think its right	8
33147	4724	So I belive that if your not a hipocrite and live as you teach your kids to that your kids will listen to you	9
33148	4724	As I have said before my dad tought me that its fine to kill animals if I am willing or going to eat them	10
33149	4724	I find one exception to this rule cyotes (we have alot of cyotes where i live at and they can be a pest)	11
33150	4724	I belive that that is about the only exception to the rule because cyotes are problem animals in this area	12
33151	4724	So if you dont want your kids watching rated @CAPS1 movies then block them on tv	13
33152	4724	Its the same thing with the other things like the magazines, books and music.	14
33153	4725	Censorship in libraries is a big argument today	0
33154	4725	Many people wonder what is considered 'appropriate' for our children	1
33155	4725	With several @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 factors these days it is hard to find something that is not offensive to ones culture	2
33156	4725	Three main reasons we are not able to find a book reasonable, yet non-offensive for our children in libraries includes @CAPS1, @CAPS2 beliefs, and @CAPS3 beliefs	3
33157	4725	@CAPS1 was a big deal in the late @NUM1's to early @DATE1's	4
33158	4725	Thanks to @LOCATION2, slavery became illegal in the @LOCATION1	5
33159	4725	Although, there are still many racist comments, articles, and films published today	6
33160	4725	If someone does not stop the harsh comments, then it @MONTH1 never stop	7
33161	4725	Even though it is not such a big deal today, that doesn't mean it won't continue to happen	8
33162	4725	Children do not need to see or hear racist comments made toward their race like many of their ancestors did	9
33163	4725	Harsh put-downs and comments toward @CAPS2 beliefs are also inappropriate for the society, let alone for children to read	10
33164	4725	Books containing this are not considered appropriate for children and need to be placed in a different section of the library	11
33165	4725	As a teenage reader, my biggest belief and interest is learning about other cultures to see what it would be like to live in another country	12
33166	4725	There are countless religions in the world today, many of which are accustomed by their own god(s)	13
33167	4725	I belief it is of a great cause for children of the modern day world to celebrate their own religion how they would like	14
33168	4725	However, I believe it is not right to make hateful opinions toward other religions	15
33169	4725	This is also a thing that yet children have the ability to read about	16
33170	4725	Children should not be reading about fictious facts of religions and making the thought process in their head when they assume something is true about that religion when it is not	17
33171	4725	It is definitely a great idea to stick those materials in the @NUM2 section	18
33172	4725	For now, children should be receiving material that they can easily comprehend and find interesting	19
33173	4725	It would be a great idea to make a fiction section appropriate for kids and then a @NUM2 section for kids and/or adults	20
33174	4725	An idea to take into consideration is that every local public library could have a meeting to decide whether to keep the library in easy-access form or not	21
33175	4725	That is for you to decide!	22
33176	4726	Every single person has there own beliefs and disbeliefs when it comes to books, music or anything in life for that matter	0
33177	4726	What @MONTH1 be a bad and vulgar book in our opinion @MONTH1 not be bad in others opinionated views	1
33178	4726	Everyone will have there own views about a book, music, movies, or magazines	2
33179	4726	That's why censorship is good in a public place like a library	3
33180	4726	Does that mean we're saying that you can't like what you want to like, listen to what you want to lisetn to, or watch what you want to watch in your own home	4
33181	4726	No, by censoring all that in public places like librarys or say video stores your helping fight a lot of trouble and concerns that could happen in the future	5
33182	4726	Then again censoring movies, music, books, and magazines in a library could also be a bad thing	6
33183	4726	Not everyone is going to like the same things or be interested in all the same movies or books	7
33184	4726	At the same time though we can't censor every single thing someone doesn't like	8
33185	4726	By removing something because one parent has a complaint over their child watching, or reading a book they thought was too 'vulgar' then your giving that right to any parent that complains about their child doing that	9
33186	4726	It's not the librarys responsibility to watch over everyones child, to make sure they watch and read what their parents want them to	10
33187	4726	Kids will be kids and they'll do what they want to do	11
33188	4726	By censoring and taking things off shelfs of librarys your not preventing them from watching a movie they shouldn't be seeing, or reading about book they're not supposed to be reading	12
33189	4726	Censoring librarys is just like censoring words in movies, by doing that it's not stopping your child from hearing or learing vulgar language	13
33190	4726	Children now in this day and age hear more vulgar words in school then they do in movies and television	14
33191	4726	What does the word offensive really mean to a person	15
33192	4726	Everyone has their own opinion on whats offensive and whats not	16
33193	4726	Like i said, everyone has there own opinions and views on life and everything in it	17
33194	4726	You can't remove everything off the shelfs because one parent doesn't think it's right for their child or other children to be seeing, looking at, or listening to	18
33195	4726	We all have freedom to look at what we want and listen to the kind of music we feel like listening to	19
33196	4726	By taking things off the shelfs that maybe other people like oppose to others then your taking that right away as a @CAPS1 citizen	20
33197	4726	Censoring on some things like, sex scenes in movies, or maybe vulgar language in music is alright in my opinion	21
33198	4726	Taking books off the shelf because you don't like the way its written or you don't like the person who wrote it, or you don't like the kind of language the author decided to use in it isn't alright to me, you're pushing the limit on that one	22
33199	4726	Books teach kids things everyday, books give children imagination	23
33200	4726	By taking books off shelfs i think you're hurting a childs ability to grow	24
33201	4726	Censoring is a good and bad thing	25
33202	4726	It could hurt children or it could help their ability to grow	26
33203	4726	Censoring some things are a good thing, but like i said not everything with vulgar language should be censored, or vulgar scences	27
33204	4726	Sometimes in order to grow and live in this world children need to read and see the things we as people but in books and movies	28
33205	4727	This is along the lines of personal thought	0
33206	4727	Some people can be happy with things ,while others disagree	1
33207	4727	Unless its racist or sexist no one has any right at all to say something can't belong	2
33208	4727	If someone doesn't like a book than walk away from it don't ponder at why its there, someone else @MONTH1 want it	3
33209	4727	So I dont like this topic personally but i am ok with writing about it	4
33210	4727	Its not a choice just like it really shouldn't even be a choice for people to say what belongs where, unless it is rightfully owned by the individual	5
33211	4727	I know there are many things I dont like but I dont try and get things moved and banned	6
33212	4727	Its there people want to read it	7
33213	4727	Plus the person who wrote or made the object would be shot down (@CAPS1 of sadness or rejection)	8
33214	4727	Along the lines of insulting a race and/or being sexist, If that is being done in the book it should be stopped and disposed of	9
33215	4727	People have the right to say they are not happy with that but if they just dont like the topic but others do than they need to move on and not make a big deal out of it	10
33216	4727	Now if the title @CAPS2 says what the book is about than walk away don't pay attention to it	11
33217	4727	People @MONTH1 use it for research or something in the future	12
33218	4727	Now people @MONTH1 be self-centered and just want what they need so they cause a huge, @CAPS3 or fight over stupid little things	13
33219	4727	Thats the people that always got things handed to them which I imagine is why this topic came up	14
33220	4727	So that is my thoughts and believes about the topic of Censorship	15
33221	4727	It doesn't matter where, in school or at a library it is there because someone is/was interested in the item	16
33222	4727	I know this is my thoughts and believes, people @MONTH1 completely think what i wrote it stupid, some @MONTH1 think its smart	17
33223	4727	Its just the culture you grew up in and @CAPS1 of mind you are in that current time and place.	18
33224	4728	I do not think that there is a need to remove offensive materials from libraries	0
33225	4728	Some people @MONTH1 find these things offensive, but I think that others will be greatly offended if they remove these things	1
33226	4728	Take rap music for example	2
33227	4728	There are many people that think that the lyrics of those  songs are just terrible and offensive	3
33228	4728	Other people think that rap music is amazing	4
33229	4728	I do not think rap is very good at all, but I would not go the extent of saying that rap songs should not be played on the radio, and that the @CAPS1 should not be sold in stores	5
33230	4728	The same thing could be said for these materials in the library	6
33231	4728	Some @MONTH1 find them offensive but others greatly apreciate it	7
33232	4728	Some people @MONTH1 be interested in these topics	8
33233	4728	Just like some people @MONTH1 be interested in fantasy or comedy	9
33234	4728	It would not be  fair for libraries to remove these materails from the library, and deny the people that do like them the rite to rent these materials	10
33235	4728	Another factors is the maturity of the reader	11
33236	4728	If the person who is reading book or viewing movies that @MONTH1 be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then is no problem with it	12
33237	4728	But if the reader is not reading for interest, then there is a problem there	13
33238	4728	It all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library	14
33239	4728	The materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them	15
33240	4728	Just because someone else @MONTH1 find those materials offensive is no reasons to take them off the shelf	16
33241	4728	I can see why some parents @MONTH1 be upset that their kids @MONTH1 see some of the things in the library that @MONTH1 not be apropriate, but all the libraries that I have been to have a had a special area for kids materials	17
33242	4728	If the parents where woried about their kids seing some the questionable materials they could bring the kid to that area	18
33243	4728	I dont think that these materials that @MONTH1 seem offensive to some people should be removed from libraries	19
33244	4728	Everyone is going to be affended by something and it is not fare to deprive others of those materials even it is offensive to some.	20
33245	4729	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed	0
33246	4729	Libraries are given to people for new learning opportuites and for entertainment purposes	1
33247	4729	Everyone has their own likes and dislikes, not two peoples are the same	2
33248	4729	First of all when a person goes to the library they should know that the books that are in there were selected by the owner of the library	3
33249	4729	Therefore it is their responsibility to put books into the library and take books out	4
33250	4729	What the owner of a library will try to do is to put a little bit of everything in it	5
33251	4729	What is ment by this statement is that there are so many differnt types of writting that people are bound to not like something	6
33252	4729	So that is why the owner will add a bit of everything into their library	7
33253	4729	If someone has gotten a book that seems to be to their type of book, but after they start to read it they find it offensive to them they should not just throw the book out all together, but they should take it back to the library and talk to the owner about it	8
33254	4729	People have their rights to do what they want with a book, but if it is a book from the library then it technically is proporty of the library	9
33255	4729	So if someone gets offended with a book they should go talk to the owner let them know their concern, and try to have something done about it	10
33256	4729	In truth they will not be the only ones who have that oppionin	11
33257	4729	It takes one person to make the difference	12
33258	4729	Books are not made for just one person they are made for many people to read and possibly enjoy	13
33259	4729	People have their oppininons and will stick by them	14
33260	4729	Thats expected to happen with books, they are all different as are people	15
33261	4729	The society that everyone lives in is filled with people of diverse oppions and who are not afraid of expressing them	16
33262	4729	There is nothing wrong with expressisng them eigther, actually its better that way only because then others can hear about a book and eigther agree with that oppionoin or disagree, therefore finding out what type of writing do they really like	17
33263	4729	Books yes can be thrown out by rights, but the moment everyone starts doing that is the moment when everyone can no longer spread their oppionion	18
33264	4729	To spread an oppion is to let the world know wehre someone stands on a spacific topic	19
33265	4729	Without that the world would be just plain old boring having nothing to talk about because people would all share the same opinoin	20
33266	4729	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed for more reasons than one	21
33267	4729	~~@PERSON1	22
33268	4730	Need help with Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1     (I chaged the @ORGANIZATION2 of this story that I heard from my grandparents because I could not remember the real one	0
33269	4730	This is not really happening at the @ORGANIZATION1 I think.)     To the people at the @ORGANIZATION3 I would like to tell you and your readers that there is something wrong with the @ORGANIZATION2	1
33270	4730	Nothing really all  to serious I guess	2
33271	4730	It seems the libaraiains there are censoring  tons of books and other materials	3
33272	4730	One of which I really need for a homework assignment on the movie @CAPS1	4
33273	4730	They say that they are censoring what I need for the assignment because it is to bloody and scary for some of the other readers	5
33274	4730	There have also been some complates from parents as well, saying that their kids had nightmares for weeks from the movie 	6
33275	4730	To that I said well can I still use the computers there to get information	7
33276	4730	They said that they have  already blocked all the inaproperate sites as well	8
33277	4730	I do not have internet at home so you can see how well that is going to go at school	9
33278	4730	So then I tryed to get the @CAPS2 to uncensor all of the stuff they have all ready have censored	10
33279	4730	So that way I could just make them censor all the werid adult rated things at the @ORGANIZATION2	11
33280	4730	That way no kid will have nightmares any more.I also threw in the idea of seperarting all the @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 by age group like child,teen, older teen	12
33281	4730	To this they said all right but they were going to keep the classic @CAPS4 and @CAPS3     The @CAPS2 said they @MONTH1 try my idea and see if it works But I would have to volunteer at the @ORGANIZATION2 and go through all the stuff that has been censored over the years	13
33282	4730	To this I said ok, but after I saw home big the censor list was it was like a nightmare over a hundered pages of book at least	14
33283	4730	I was to scared to see how long the other lists were	15
33284	4730	So seeing that it was to big for me to handle alone I got most of the other volunteers to help me	16
33285	4730	Then put up posters at the school I go to,to see if anyone else would be willing to help me	17
33286	4730	So far there has not been much progress in the lists so I would like to ask that if there are any readers out there reading this article	18
33287	4730	I could sure use your help because these are some really long lists	19
33288	4730	I @CAPS8 you all for reading this article, if you are not able to help then see if there is anyone else you know that would be willing too,@CAPS8 You.	20
33289	4732	Have you ever read or seen a book that you thought was not appropriate	0
33290	4732	Did you want to ban the book from the library you got it from	1
33291	4732	Well many people have experienced this and many of them have wanted to have more sensorship in libraries but we can not always do this	2
33292	4732	Maybe that book that you just put down, deeming it inappropriate for all to read it, is someone else's favorite book	3
33293	4732	You @MONTH1 never know but maybe someone might think your favorite book is not appropriate	4
33294	4732	There are many different people in the world and they all have different opinions	5
33295	4732	So instead of banning them how about libraries and schools just sensor them	6
33296	4732	Censoring seems like a no brainer but a lot of people do not think about it	7
33297	4732	We can not just close our eyes to all the inappropriate books out there but we can at least censor them	8
33298	4732	Censoring them could be as simple as just putting a tag on them or making a different section for just those kinds of books	9
33299	4732	The tags should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book	10
33300	4732	People do not have to get rid of some books completely but they need to recognize that young children could pick it up and start reading it without knowing that it is not very appropriate for them	11
33301	4732	Parents do have the right to check and monitor what their child is reading	12
33302	4732	Although if you just get rid of the book completely, people are also getting rid of other people's freedom of speech	13
33303	4732	No one has the right to determine what books are not appropriate and what books are, so no one should have the right to just have certain books just removed from the shelves	14
33304	4732	Instead of banning the books or complaining about it them, people could try a rating system for books	15
33305	4732	When you buy movies a lot of times people check the rating on the movie to see if it would be appropriate for their child or even for themselves	16
33306	4732	This is what we could do with books too and maybe there will not be as many problems with books	17
33307	4732	It sounds simple enough but people need to take action and start to do something about it	18
33308	4732	You @MONTH1 not be able to make everyone happy but at least people can be more informed about the books they are reading	19
33309	4732	If everyone can help out in the effort to make our libraries and school more censored than all the libraries would be a lot happier places full of adventure	20
33310	4733	Offensive materials @CAPS4 be anything but I'm talking about libraries and whats inside	0
33311	4733	Books, music, movies, and magazines @CAPS4 be offensive to someone but not everyone	1
33312	4733	Removing these materials from library shelves because a few people veiw them as offensive material is not a good idea because if they find it offensive then somewhere someone is enjoying it	2
33313	4733	Not everyone will find a book, song, movie, or a magazine to be offensive and for that reason no books, cds, movies, or magazines should be withheld from the public in any library	3
33314	4733	My friends liked reading @PERSON1 books but i did not like them, but i did not make them stop reading because of it, just like 'To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3,' @CAPS4 be offensive but if you find it offensive don't read it, plain and simple	4
33315	4733	There wil always be one person who doesn't want their kid to watch a certain movie, or read a @PERSON1 book, but that is not a good reason to remove any materials from the libray shelves, let people read what they want to read, watch what they want, and listen to what they want, there is no good reason to remove a book form the libray shelves	5
33316	4733	We all have a right to read, watch, and listen to anything we please	6
33317	4733	Having somebody you have never seen get a book, movie, or a magazine removed from the library because they find it a little offensive, is like having someone kick you because you don't have a lot of money	7
33318	4733	Many books from all over the world @CAPS4 be considered offensive to at least one person and that one maybe two people do not have any right to tell anyone what they can not read	8
33319	4733	Censorship in libraries is a horrible idea because not everyone will read that book or listen to that cd	9
33320	4733	Having a chance is all we need to read a book or listen to a song that might change our lives, for better or worse it should be our choice to read what we want	10
33321	4733	Any material @CAPS4 be considered 'offensive' but most of it is not offensive just what people don't want their kids to read	11
33322	4733	Offensive or non-offensive materials can not be declared by a few people but by an entire country	12
33323	4733	What one man considers offensive another man considers to be life changing	13
33324	4733	Anything can make someone change and in order to have that chance we should have the freedom to read what ever we would like	14
33325	4733	If you find a book offensive remeber this you had a chance to read it, now give that chance to someone else.	15
33326	4734	Todays world is filled with rasicm and critisim	0
33327	4734	Anything we do is either right or wrong, no inbetween	1
33328	4734	Whenever your out to eat, or shopping you can hear offensive comments or images all around you	2
33329	4734	The newspaper, news, and internet make events appear worse than what it is, if it refers to certain people they take it offensive	3
33330	4734	If you go out looking for a good book to read, or a movie to watch, or music to listen to laying in bed, you pick what interests you	4
33331	4734	When your looking through the selection you're going to see and reconize titles, or pictures that offend you	5
33332	4734	I know when I do I pick the object up and look and see what it says on the back	6
33333	4734	In someway, someone, is going to find a movie, music, books, or magazine offensive	7
33334	4734	Say we take everything off the shelves off every store that is offensive in any way to people	8
33335	4734	What would be on the shelves	9
33336	4734	Nothing, @CAPS1 have to right to write about anything they want, singers have the right to sing about what they want	10
33337	4734	In the @ORGANIZATION1 every single person has the freedom of speech	11
33338	4734	So libraries can't take something off the shelves just because someone @NUM1 it offensive	12
33339	4734	That's the point of the different genres of music and reading, so you can read and listen to what you want	13
33340	4734	Every @CAPS2 has the choice of what they pick up and listen to or read	14
33341	4734	If someone finds something offensive, then they shouldn't pick the object up	15
33342	4734	Then, when that person complains about it, the bottom line is that it's their fault for reading it	16
33343	4734	There's going to be offensive things said about race, culture, looks, and weight	17
33344	4734	That's just apart of life and how people act anymore	18
33345	4734	There;'s just a point when you have to be the bigger person and ignore it and move on	19
33346	4734	So, no I do not believe that offensive books, music, or magazines shoulkd be removed from libraries or stores	20
33347	4734	We have the choice to pick what we read and listen to.	21
33348	4737	I think that everyone has the right to hate or abhor cetian works but only the author of the work has the right to take it off of the shelf	0
33349	4737	The reason that just anyone can not take a work off the shelf is if the one person hates the work but everyone else likes it then imanenge how the people who like the work must feel when they hear it was distroyed	1
33350	4737	Can you think of how the author of any work would feel if thousands of their works were being distroyed without any thought to others	2
33351	4737	I can and I feel horible just thinking about it so I belive that is the reason that only the creator of anything should make the disicion if their work should be saved or distroyed	3
33352	4737	With these reasons that I have shaired with you please consider how everyone feels before you destroy anything if it is a book, movie, song, or even a childs dreams think about how thet would feel if anything of theirs was distroyed.	4
33353	4738	Dear reader,     Do you believe that certain book, magazines, movie, and music should be removed from the shelves of libaries if they are found offensive	0
33354	4738	A lot of people in the world today are having this same question	1
33355	4738	Some parents think they should be removed, but others argue they should stay	2
33356	4738	I'm going to tell you what i think	3
33357	4738	As a citzen,  I know some parents are arguing that certain magazines and books should be removed from the libary if they are found offensive	4
33358	4738	Well if they do that then there wouldn't be anything on the shelves in the libary would be shut down	5
33359	4738	I mean i see where some of the parents are coming from some of these things are offensive and not apporaite for children, but if you dont want your children to see it them keep them away from that section of the libary or don't bring them, you go get the book or magazine they want and then bring it back home for them	6
33360	4738	In the world today everything is offensive to someone in the world i mean everyone has there own thoughts on what they think is offensive and what they don't think is offensive	7
33361	4738	So eventually if you were to take everything offensive out of the libary it would be emptied out	8
33362	4738	I want you all to read this quote and really think about what the author is saying ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf	9
33363	4738	But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf -that work i abhor- then you have the exact same right and so does everyone else	10
33364	4738	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (@PERSON1)	11
33365	4738	I don't know about you, but this really sums it all up for me	12
33366	4738	The truth is you cant always do what you want, you just have to live with the way it is and try to make it better for yourself and your family	13
33367	4738	If you read this article and really listen and take into considertion what im saying i think you 'll find that it would be a lot easier for you to just act like the offensive books and magzines aren't there because if you try to get them taken out you wont even be able to go to the libary anymore	14
33368	4738	sincerly the one and only,                                                                     @PERSON2	15
33369	4739	I believe that censorship in libraries can be a good thing, but can go too far	0
33370	4739	Removing movies and magazines that contain pointless offensive material from the shelves could be a good thing	1
33371	4739	If those are removed I do not think that people would care that much	2
33372	4739	Removing those small things, however, could grow into a bigger problem	3
33373	4739	It has to be decided how far is too far when removing objects from the shelves	4
33374	4739	It all starts with a bad magazine that has a bad picture of a movie star doing something offensive with text surrounding it being pointlessly judgemental	5
33375	4739	A parent sees his or her kid reading this at the library and they do not believe it is appropriate so they complain and the magazine is taken off the shelf	6
33376	4739	Then a movie arises that is offensive and it is taken off the shelf	7
33377	4739	Pretty soon everyone is comming in with minor complaints about many different things and almost everything has someone who wants it banned	8
33378	4739	Even if there was a set limit on what qualifies as able to be banned people would still complain until what they want happens	9
33379	4739	If the government has all these complaints they might just shut down the libraries to avoid looking over every 'offensive' piece of literature, film, or artwork	10
33380	4739	The original purpose being to block out offensive meterial ends with the realization that everything is offensive to somebody	11
33381	4739	Even what might be considered a great piece of work by most could be considered an abomination by some	12
33382	4739	In the end a library should not be given the right to censor anything	13
33383	4739	The things that should be censored are a very small percentage and it is not worth the risk	14
33384	4739	Books that are offensive to some serve as inspiration to others	15
33385	4739	Libraries were made to give people the chance to be inspired	16
33386	4739	The library should not have the right to take inspiration away from the reader's hand.	17
33387	4740	What @CAPS1 You Do	0
33388	4740	A very big battle for a lot of people is if libraries should allow offensive matterial to be on their shelves	1
33389	4740	Some people don't care, but some people think it's a very big issue	2
33390	4740	For the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive matterial should be taken off of the library shelf	3
33391	4740	I personally believe that it should be ok for 'offensive' matterial to be on the shelves of the libraties across the @ORGANIZATION1	4
33392	4740	What is conciterd offensive	5
33393	4740	Each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive	6
33394	4740	An example is a young child @MONTH1 think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word	7
33395	4740	If we did take off all the offensive matterial from the libraries, there @CAPS1 be nothing left	8
33396	4740	You @MONTH1 think that the @ORGANIZATION2 is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the @ORGANIZATION2 is false, they @MONTH1 think that by having the @ORGANIZATION2 of the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs	9
33397	4740	Because so many people have a difforent view on what is offensive, no one @CAPS1 ever be able to actually have a non-offensive library	10
33398	4740	A group of people @CAPS1 not be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive	11
33399	4740	There are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not	12
33400	4740	People can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library	13
33401	4740	It should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out	14
33402	4740	Each person is responsible for their own actions	15
33403	4740	If a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it	16
33404	4740	It is a free world	17
33405	4740	Some people @MONTH1 not aprove of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music	18
33406	4740	In conclusion I state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library	19
33407	4740	If someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book	20
33408	4740	Really the question should not be, 'Should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc	21
33409	4740	from the library that are offensive?', the question should be, 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'	22
33410	4740	It is everyone's own choice to read a book or listen to a @LOCATION1	23
33411	4740	We are not accountable for what other people do	24
33412	4740	It is not the libraries own resonsiblility to be a mother to all of it's cusomers	25
33413	4740	Let the libraries be!	26
33414	4741	I belive that offensive books should be taken off the shelf	0
33415	4741	Some books are offensive and some are inaproprate	1
33416	4741	The libarian could get rid of the books, so the little kids can'@CAPS2 get the inaproprate book	2
33417	4741	Movies that are rate '@CAPS1' and above should be removed	3
33418	4741	Anything that has an 'A' rating should be removed, the libaries are a public place to rent and return, buy or sell, or to trade movies, books, and etc	4
33419	4741	Keeping the books that are safe for kids is important for their mental health	5
33420	4741	Anything inaproprate could be censored by a black marker	6
33421	4741	The old libuary I used to go to, had all the slang, cus-words, and etc, all marked out with a black sharpie	7
33422	4741	Some of the movies were thrown out of the rating '@CAPS2' to all the above, the magazines, had marks on the pages also, censored the slag in the magazine	8
33423	4741	The music at the libuary was blocked, some music was not blocked, and the rest were the censored part of the songs	9
33424	4741	The librares should do the same like the old one did.	10
33425	4742	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1     @CAPS2 my name is @PERSON1 and I am a student that attends @ORGANIZATION1	0
33426	4742	I go to libraries quit often, and things that I see in there I feel souldnt be in there	1
33427	4742	Like the movies	2
33428	4742	Theyre okay, but theyre all sitting together	3
33429	4742	So that means me bein a young lady	4
33430	4742	I see things that I know my mother wouldnt approve of me even looking at	5
33431	4742	They have censored movies just sitting there	6
33432	4742	I even go through the shelfves sometimes and see the type of books that my mother wouldnt even look at	7
33433	4742	They have censored books in the libraries just sitting there like its a book about @CAPS3 or something	8
33434	4742	I have conversations with some of the workers sometimes, and they dont see anything wrong with little kids or teenagers looking at censored things	9
33435	4742	Not all of them think that way though	10
33436	4742	I dont think or feel that it should be censored books in the library and children aare able to look at them	11
33437	4742	Thats not right at all	12
33438	4742	Far as the music i agree with music at libraries, because many people listen to different type of music	13
33439	4742	As long as the music is something positive, but there are all kinds	14
33440	4742	You just have to be careful what music you listen to at a library because there are young people everywhere	15
33441	4742	There are children around the age of @NUM1 in there, and younger too	16
33442	4742	They wouldnt know how to respond to a song thats talking about killing people or shooting them somewhere	17
33443	4742	Then you never know what there parents wanted them to know at a young age like that	18
33444	4742	I dont feel that real nasty and bad music should be played at @CAPS4 Libraries	19
33445	4742	I dont believe censored magazines should be in there either	20
33446	4742	I really believe that magazines are one the main censored things in the library	21
33447	4742	There are many of them books also	22
33448	4742	They shouldnt be there at all just for the sake of the children and parents.They dont need to grow up fast they need to enjoy there life while they are young	23
33449	4742	And by looking at the censored things thats not helping at all	24
33450	4742	Inconclusion, I really think something needs to be done about all of these censored things	25
33451	4742	Many people complain to the @CAPS1 when they come in the @CAPS4 Libraries	26
33452	4742	What im just askin you for is that you please help our @CAPS4 Libraries get those nasty things out of there	27
33453	4742	They can even make there own side of the Libraries with just censored things for adults only	28
33454	4742	I know that this is the right thing and i kno many people agree with me	29
33455	4742	People only want the best for their children and a library with alot of censored things in there doesnt sound like the best	30
33456	4742	That just mean they are startin off wrong	31
33457	4742	Sincerly: A student who believes in changes	32
33458	4743	Everyone has a preference in works of literature, such as books, magazines, movies or music	0
33459	4743	Different types of these works of literature are significant to each person	1
33460	4743	If everyone had the right to completely remove one piece of work that displeases them, then no works would remain	2
33461	4743	Therefore, I believe no materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from public libraries or other public places	3
33462	4743	Everyone has unique ideas, necesities and preferences	4
33463	4743	A few years ago, I had a classmate who had different ideas from a myriad of people on religious persecution	5
33464	4743	He hated the idea of mixing people of different religions into one place	6
33465	4743	He wrote a paper containing all of his ideas on how the world should function in terms of religion	7
33466	4743	He tried to publish it, but did not succeed because his work was considered offensive	8
33467	4743	Even though I disagree with his ideas, I do not think his work should have been rejected	9
33468	4743	There could have been people in the world who did agree with his thoughts and would have been interested to read them	10
33469	4743	There could even have been ideas in his paper that could've helped countries solve various problems	11
33470	4743	I believe it is unfair that his paper was rejected	12
33471	4743	People have different necesities based on what they have to accomplish	13
33472	4743	For example, I was reading a book last @DATE1 about a girl who was doing a project on racism	14
33473	4743	She went to the library to search for a book about apartheid in @LOCATION1 but couldn't find anything	15
33474	4743	She asked a librarian if there were any, but the librarian told her that books such as those were considered offensive in that local library and she would have to search elsewhere	16
33475	4743	I believe that it is unjust because the girl @MONTH1 not have had anywhere else to go to get the information about her project	17
33476	4743	She should've had the right to access the information that she needed for the project to prevent her from failing	18
33477	4743	Another reason that no books should be removed is simply because everyone has unique preferences	19
33478	4743	In the world, there are books that certain people would enjoy more than others	20
33479	4743	Literature should be abled to be used for the purpose of entertainment and convenience	21
33480	4743	If I were to go to a library now, I would find many selections that correspond to my ideal novel or magazine	22
33481	4743	Every person should have that right	23
33482	4743	If people start removing materials that are offensive to them, then nothing on the shelves would remain and not one person would have the right to have access to the materials they desire	24
33483	4743	In this world, diversity exists everywhere	25
33484	4743	People have and always will want, need and desire different things	26
33485	4743	Works of literature are just one of them	27
33486	4743	If people begin to eliminate offensive materials based on everyone's frustration or displeasures, then no books will remain on the public shelves	28
33487	4743	Therefore, materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should never be removed from public places	29
33488	4743	These things are necessities to the world.	30
33489	4745	'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc	0
33490	4745	should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' @CAPS1 these items should be taken off the shelves if found offensive	1
33491	4745	First off, they should be removed because some people @MONTH1 be offended by them	2
33492	4745	Some @MONTH1 talk about race, religion or gender	3
33493	4745	Nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such	4
33494	4745	For example: rap music, all that is, is just people taking about what color they are or how big or small they are	5
33495	4745	Some people @MONTH1 be offended, and im sure no parent wants their child to be listening to that nonsense	6
33496	4745	So take them off the radio	7
33497	4745	Second off, if a child gets ahold of a criticizing book or movie or such that item can have a bad affect in the later future	8
33498	4745	They could start criticizing people for being different	9
33499	4745	Some books talk about religion, some people just cannot help their religion, they were born that way so they are familiar with it and do not want to change	10
33500	4745	No one should be judged for their religion, so take them off the shelves	11
33501	4745	Thirdly, my friend was watching a movie and it was about a female that liked the same sex, and in that movie they were making fun of her	12
33502	4745	No one should be judged by which sex they like	13
33503	4745	She was very offended	14
33504	4745	So take them off the shelves	15
33505	4745	Second to last, magazine authors take pictures of celebrities and down size them about three sizes smaller than what they really are and put them on the cover of fashion magazines or such	16
33506	4745	Why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are	17
33507	4745	Some @MONTH1 take offense to that	18
33508	4745	So just take pictures of celebrity and put them on the magazine as their real size or take them off the shelves	19
33509	4745	In conclusion,  in some of my observations and reading some people get offended quite often for being a different race, gender, or  religion	20
33510	4745	So I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive	21
33511	4746	Do you think libraries should have the right to take books and movies off the shelves if they find it offensive	0
33512	4746	In my opinon I do not agree and I think they should not be able to take them off the shelves	1
33513	4746	Many people have different thoughts and opinons and I am going to state mine in the next few paragraphs	2
33514	4746	To begin with, not everybody likes to read or watch the same types of books or movies.Some like romantic,scary,myserious and there are many more selections.For instincts if one person reads something that they do not agree with, that does not mean the next person to read it is not going to like it either	3
33515	4746	Sometimes I enjoy reading books where people get hurt and sometimes killed but @CAPS1 someone else reads it,they might think that it is horrible and very offensive	4
33516	4746	Another reason is, @CAPS1 I go to the library I expect to get the book that I want to read not what others like	5
33517	4746	One time I went to the library and I was looking for a romantic book to read and I could not find it	6
33518	4746	So I went up and asked the lady at the counter and she said they do not have it anymore,and I asked why and she told me a lady found it wrong for children to be reading	7
33519	4746	In my opinon, maybe that lady did not even like romantic books.They should not just off of what one person believes	8
33520	4746	The next reason is, the library put the movie or book on the shelf in the first place because they thought people would enjoy it	9
33521	4746	The writer or producer would not be very happy if he found out that his/her movie or book got taken out of the library because they found it offensive	10
33522	4746	Just give the book a chance and see how everybody likes it	11
33523	4746	I understand if everybody thought it was really offensive to take it off but not just one person	12
33524	4746	To end with, my belief is that if they had the book in their library at one time it should just stay in there till it gets old and falls apart	13
33525	4746	The library is open to any and every type of books,not just boring ones.So I believe the books should not get taken off the sheleves they should just stay right were their suppose to be.If they do not like the book or movie then suggest to other peoples family not to read it or have them read it and see their reaction	14
33526	4747	When you walk into the heavenly sanctuary that is our library, you have opened yourself up to a vast wealth of knowledge that is available to you at the click of a mouse, the push of a button, or the turn of a page	0
33527	4747	There are those of a select few, however, who are under the paradigm that not all of this information is for all eyes	1
33528	4747	They feel it should be locked away, as if it were some eyesore	2
33529	4747	Allow me to address this view with retaliation and distaste on a number of levels in the following document	3
33530	4747	I am a musician	4
33531	4747	Music is my passion	5
33532	4747	My creative gears are forever turning	6
33533	4747	Often I look to other artists' works for inspiration, and the one place to get that music is, you guessed it, the library	7
33534	4747	How disappointed am I when I find that the music I want has been removed for being explicit	8
33535	4747	It was not the lyrics or foul message I sought, but the beautiful melodies and harmonies therein	9
33536	4747	It does not do well to isolate media without first seeing the good that lies in it and the strong feelings it has to convey	10
33537	4747	We @MONTH1 discard the world's greatest novel because of racial discrepancies or wizardry	11
33538	4747	We @MONTH1 throw away a moving song because of its lyrics	12
33539	4747	We @MONTH1 trash a movie after only reading the title, never even giving it a chance	13
33540	4747	How fair is this	14
33541	4747	Even now there @MONTH1 be those who refuse to read your newspaper because of their disagreements with one, individual editor	15
33542	4747	That is no fair crop in my right mind	16
33543	4747	I implore you, as a public, as people of sound mind and stout hearts to reconsider the censorship of those works which have a clear and true message and were forged for the benefit of our humankind	17
33544	4747	All things have a story to tell	18
33545	4747	A friend of mine once said to me, that there were three ways we could absorb things that we find undesirable	19
33546	4747	We can reject, we can ignore, or we can absorb and interpret	20
33547	4747	To reject leaves you no smarter	21
33548	4747	To ignore leaves you in fear	22
33549	4747	However, to absorb, you gain new knowledge, be it of a new culture or new person	23
33550	4747	Everything must be taken with a grain of salt	24
33551	4747	Let us watch something we find immoral and then take the time to understand why it is immoral, for it is these things that define us	25
33552	4747	If you do not see what is or is not right, who is to say what is truly ethical	26
33553	4747	We need material of substance in our libraries, for our exposure and for our fathoming of new knowledge in our modern world	27
33554	4749	When you think of a book do you think happy kids books, or mysterious dark books	0
33555	4749	What if I was to say offensive books	1
33556	4749	Most magazines, music, books, and movies you take off the shelf today are not so happy or mysterious that you @MONTH1 think	2
33557	4749	When I think of a movie I want to watch I think of something that im going to injoy	3
33558	4749	not something im going to shut off in the middle of it	4
33559	4749	What if you pick a movie that @MONTH1 look good from the front cover and you read the back and it sounds good but when you get home to watch it with your little sister or brother its the exact opposite	5
33560	4749	Do you turn it in	6
33561	4749	Do you turn it off and waist your money not doing anything about it	7
33562	4749	Offensive books, movie, music, and magazines should be cleared from the store	8
33563	4749	If your not going to finish it, then why is it there	9
33564	4749	Im not going to watch or read a book if its not going to make me feel good as a person or make myself feel good	10
33565	4749	If people can sit there and write it, act it or play it then we should be able to speak our oppinion on it if its good or not	11
33566	4749	People have feelings, if there going be hurt by something we should enjoy then take them off the shelves	12
33567	4749	Do something about it	13
33568	4749	We all should have the success for doing something for other people, and if not that then for ourselves.	14
33569	4751	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves at a library if they could be found offensive	0
33570	4751	It is good to be unique, and no matter how innapropriate a subject might be, it is still factual and helpful in learning	1
33571	4751	If anything they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says somthing along the lines of 'adult content.' @CAPS1 repeats it's self, and this quote reminds me of periods in @CAPS1 where we need to learn from our mistakes, no matter how bad the subjects are, such as the @CAPS2, and the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the deep south	2
33572	4751	What about the @CAPS2, when @NUM1 million @CAPS7 were killed because they were @CAPS7	3
33573	4751	@CAPS7 @MONTH1 find these books offensive but that doesn't mean the @CAPS2 never happened	4
33574	4751	There are many offensive and contraversial pictures and stories about events that happened during the @CAPS2	5
33575	4751	Even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject, it is still good for our @CAPS20 to learn about what happened	6
33576	4751	And other catagories need to be read because it can help @CAPS20 to understand right from wrong, and help prevent them from making big mistakes in the future	7
33577	4751	The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 started from the @DATE1's all the way until @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @NUM2	8
33578	4751	The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 took a toll on everyone in the @LOCATION1A, but some people couldn't handle it as well as others	9
33579	4751	In the south, most @CAPS19 treated @CAPS17 @CAPS18 as dirt	10
33580	4751	They didn't let them in their schools, in their clubs or churches, they were rude towards them, and most horrific of all, they lynched them	11
33581	4751	There were a set of @PERSON1 called the '@PERSON1,' which pretty much was a list of @PERSON1 to treat @CAPS25 as unfairly as possible	12
33582	4751	If a kid were to pick up a book or magazine with pictures of lynchings in them, they would remember it their whole life, and if that one picture truly bothered them, they their whole life growing up, they would realize that what @CAPS19 did to @CAPS25 was unethical	13
33583	4751	Some books and magazines in libraries are really explicit, but we can't shelter our @CAPS20 their whole lives	14
33584	4751	Parents need to sit down with their @CAPS20 when they have questions and discuss the truth with them	15
33585	4751	What are parents going to do when their @CAPS20 go to school and hear other @CAPS20 talk about subjects such as sex	16
33586	4751	@CAPS20 could get the wrong idea about sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents never actually sat down and explained to them what sex is	17
33587	4751	I am not saying to go let your @NUM3 year old look at pictures of people having sex by any means, but when @CAPS20 get to a certain age, their parents need to step up and talk to them about uncomfortable subjects such as puberty, sex, and babies	18
33588	4751	It is time parents stop hiding the truth from their @CAPS20, or hovering over their shoulders like helecoptors	19
33589	4751	If @CAPS20 don't learn the truth about the real @CAPS13 and about how many evil and manipulative people there are in the @CAPS13, when they go to college they won't be able to stand for themselves	20
33590	4751	If @CAPS20 don't learn about @CAPS1 and what all has been done, it is kind of like we are treating the books like the @CAPS7 and the @CAPS17 @CAPS18 were treated	21
33591	4751	Just because these books are different than others we will just get rid of them, just like how we tried to kill off all the @CAPS7 and @CAPS25 because they were different	22
33592	4751	And it is wrong and inhuman	23
33593	4752	Censorship in libraries is when a librarian has the right to remove certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., from the shelves of a library, if the item is inapropiate	0
33594	4752	I believe that libraries should not have censorship	1
33595	4752	I personally, think that it should be up to the library if they could have that power	2
33596	4752	If it is a library were there's always smaller children their, then I think they could have the power of censorship	3
33597	4752	In conclusion, it should be the parents of the smaller children's responsibility to make sure their child's book is appropiate for there son or daughter	4
33598	4752	Now, say if it was just a normal library with both a mixture of both grown-ups and children, then I would say there still is no need at all for a censorship	5
33599	4752	First in for most, because its your choice of the item, if you think it is offensive then simply do not read it, watch it or listen to it	6
33600	4752	Second of all, it wouldn't be fair to the people in the library who liked a certain item, but could no longer use that item just because one person thought it was offensive	7
33601	4752	Also people would just start saying they thought that item was not suited for the library just because they did not like it period	8
33602	4752	Last of all, members of the library would have the same right as the librarians	9
33603	4752	So many of all the members have such different feelings on items, that so many different items would be taken off the shelf, that by the end there would be no books left	10
33604	4752	In conclusion, personally I do not think censorship is necessary in libraries	11
33605	4752	It would not be needed because smaller children's parents should be responsible enough check the child's items, and also because there would be so much conflict with what items were taken of the shelf and how many items were taken off the shelf	12
33606	4752	There for, I believe cencorship is not need in libraries.	13
33607	4753	I know that some people find some books offensive mean cruel or racist but most of the time people write @CAPS4 beacuase its what they feel or what people want to read	0
33608	4753	Books are a privlige and we should be able to use that privledge	1
33609	4753	People need to learn that its ok that books are sometimes are a little harsh	2
33610	4753	The @CAPS1 is not the most friendly place ever and books can help convay that with less hurt then  experencing @CAPS4 first hand	3
33611	4753	I know that all books should be left on the shelfs becuase just because its offensive to someone doesnt mean that you should take @CAPS4 off	4
33612	4753	For every book someone will find @CAPS4 offensive because of somthing	5
33613	4753	If the cause is if its offensive then all books should be gone	6
33614	4753	If someone took the time to go out and write and book and make sure that everything about @CAPS4 is correct then why should we stop them from letting people read @CAPS4	7
33615	4753	They have a right to write @CAPS4 and we have a right to read @CAPS4 and no one should take that right away	8
33616	4753	If someone wrote a book on the hollocost people are very offended by that but they dont try to get ride of @CAPS4	9
33617	4753	so why should any book be different because its not a big event like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3	10
33618	4753	Its just seem so upserd that people who go to such lengths to get rid of a book just because they are offended by @CAPS4	11
33619	4753	I think they just need to suck @CAPS4 up and move on	12
33620	4753	if they dont like @CAPS4 then dont read @CAPS4	13
33621	4753	Someone who wants to can so do not take that away from the people that want to read @CAPS4	14
33622	4753	I remember a time when someone wanted to read a book in are library and they said,'oh you cant read that because @CAPS4 was found to offencive.' @CAPS4 made me uphald that they would deciede how someone els feels about a book	15
33623	4753	@CAPS4 makes me so angry that they get to dicied how someone els feels about a book	16
33624	4753	they must be magic becuase I did not know that they know how someone els feels about a book or anything for that matter	17
33625	4753	we do have books here that are kept behind the librarians desk that if you really wanted to read that book its behind her desk	18
33626	4753	and im ok with that beacuse at least they have @CAPS4 for people to read if they really wanted to	19
33627	4753	This is what i think should happen if they have books that they think is too offensive to people	20
33628	4753	At least try to give an effert to perserve are right as citizens of the @ORGANIZATION1	21
33629	4753	Lets throw an other aspect here about money	22
33630	4753	the book that you want so badly gone from a library was most likely payed by you, the tax payer	23
33631	4753	So you and a lot of others payed for this book and now you want to wast that money	24
33632	4753	That is just insane that you would want to wast that money after @CAPS4 being payed for	25
33633	4753	This just make me want to say wow do you really want to be that upset about a book	26
33634	4753	Does @CAPS4 make you feel better that you got all worked up over a book and now its gone	27
33635	4753	Well good for you mission accomplished	28
33636	4753	All you did was get worked up and you wasted money	29
33637	4753	People just need to relize the bigger picture not just themselfs but others	30
33638	4753	In them taking down a book because you were offended, offends me	31
33639	4753	This offends me a large amount because now you ruined somthing that was not nessisary to be taken down	32
33640	4753	This is how I feel about this subject	33
33641	4753	I am very upset that people would do this and go to such lengths to ban a book away from a library	34
33642	4753	If you wrote a book and people did this to you how would you feel	35
33643	4753	I know that you would feel like dirt that someone would do this to your hard work	36
33644	4753	People need to just calm down and smell the roses and forget about things that do not matter	37
33645	4753	Stand back and think for a second and say,'will this really effect me if i get this book taken off the shelf.' @CAPS4 also make me mad that the libary bought the book and now its gone so did the money just go to waist becuase the book is just gone	38
33646	4753	This is how I feel on the matter of getting ride of books.	39
33647	4754	Do citizens have the right to remove books, magazines, and other materials from shelves because they personally do not agree with the content	0
33648	4754	Censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer	1
33649	4754	Some believe it is in their right to get rid of books, music, and movies with what they believe is 'offensive' material	2
33650	4754	Others think library censorship is wrong, that people should have access to whatever material they please	3
33651	4754	Censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own	4
33652	4754	In @DATE1's society, there are no limits	5
33653	4754	The human imagination can create beautiful works of literary art and music, but it can also create material not suitable for every age group	6
33654	4754	Library censorship is a way to keep this 'unsuitable' material away from young and curious eyes	7
33655	4754	However, what @MONTH1 be unacceptable for children to view @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for a mature adult	8
33656	4754	Censorship is purely opinion	9
33657	4754	If a person is a strict believer that @CAPS1 created the world in seven days, they might find it offensive to see a book or a movie that supports the theory of evolution	10
33658	4754	If a parent does not want their child to watch @CAPS2, they would rather their children not see a @CAPS2 disk in the children's section for their child to see	11
33659	4754	If one person harbors a profound grudge against @CAPS4, it is unfair to others if all @CAPS5 content is removed from a library's shelves	12
33660	4754	If a person does not wish to have access to certain 'offensive' subjects, then they do not have to expose themselves to it	13
33661	4754	But it is not in their rights to remove it from the view of others who @MONTH1 wish to educate themselves on the said matters	14
33662	4754	Writing is a form of self- expression, a method by which to convey feelings and thoughts and share them with others	15
33663	4754	It is also a way to teach and to inform others about the past	16
33664	4754	But if what is written is not shared, how can one form their own opinions and thoughts when they are not exposed to the opinions of those outside their community	17
33665	4754	It is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain subject simply because one or two other people oppose the content	18
33666	4754	If books and movies containing information unacceptable to one person were removed, then everyone else has the right to have material of their choice removed as well	19
33667	4754	Eventually, there would be nothing left because everyone is offended by one thing or another	20
33668	4754	That is one of the beauties of being an @CAPS6 citizen: freedom of speech	21
33669	4754	By living in @LOCATION1, one has the right to read or learn about whatever they please	22
33670	4754	Censorship prevents learning from those who want it	23
33671	4754	Parents are possibly some of the biggest advocates of library censorship	24
33672	4754	Not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable	25
33673	4754	But just because they do not want their child to see a movie about devil worship or the @CAPS7 era does not mean the parent has the right to prevent all others from seeing it	26
33674	4754	Children need to be exposed to these kinds of things at some point to encourage open- mindedness and acceptance of others	27
33675	4754	Libraries provide a source by which young people can educate themselves on the religions, beliefs, and customs of the outside world	28
33676	4754	It should not be up to the parents to decide what is put on the library shelves	29
33677	4754	if they do not want their children to have access to certain subjects, do not allow them to go to the library	30
33678	4754	In conclusion, one can say library censorship is a matter of opinion	31
33679	4754	Citizens have a right to read, listen to, or watch whatever material they please	32
33680	4754	Granted, it is acceptable for parents to shield their children from certain subjects, but it is unaccepable for those same parents to prevent others in the community from learning	33
33681	4754	Freedom to express one's opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others	34
33682	4754	As Katherine Paterson once said, '..	35
33683	4754	And then we have no bookes left of the shelf for any of us.	36
33684	4755	Why do we have books out there that are viewed as offensive	0
33685	4755	If they are inapropriate, why do we keep putting those books, magazines, movies, and the big one, music out there in the world	1
33686	4755	Let me tell you why, because people in @LOCATION1 unfortunatly, have grown out of @CAPS1-duty time, @PERSON1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and many other nonoffensive shows	2
33687	4755	But with the shows, books, and movies played today are very inapropriate to the younger viewers	3
33688	4755	@DATE1 @TIME1 cartoons are over, at least the good cartoon like @CAPS4 and @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS5, ect, these cartoons, that I used to watch, that taught me how to be @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @CAPS8 have faded away	4
33689	4755	With the cartoons out now that are supposed to be good for children, all show @CAPS22 the same thing and that @CAPS22 @CAPS9, @CAPS10, @CAPS11, and all the other @NUM1 deadly sins	5
33690	4755	They show these without explaning anything that can help the child in life, and that @CAPS22 @CAPS12	6
33691	4755	We can @CAPS23 take books off the shelves, make directors' quit directing, rappers' quit rapping, or make the pornoghraphy stop but we can restrict it to a point	7
33692	4755	It will always be out there weather it @CAPS22 by the blackmarket or the adult stores.Thankfully there are ways around letting your children watch these shows	8
33693	4755	Restrictions on the television, make the offencive books, magazines in a library to a(n) restricted area to where no one can enter without being @NUM2 years old	9
33694	4755	There @CAPS22 a lot to say about the music out there	10
33695	4755	It can be and @CAPS22 very offensive	11
33696	4755	I was born and raised on the old fasion country music and unfortunatly country music has gone to the dogs	12
33697	4755	Sorry to say but the change in music started at the begining of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS13, with the hippies	13
33698	4755	While they where all hopped up on @CAPS14, @CAPS15, and @CAPS16, they brought to life the new @CAPS17 and @CAPS18	14
33699	4755	So it has been here over @NUM3 years it @CAPS22 @CAPS23 going away	15
33700	4755	All we can do @CAPS22 hope our children does @CAPS23 turn on the radio that @CAPS22 tuned into that crap and say '@CAPS19 that sound like good music.'     With the pornoghraphic magazines, they have been around since @PERSON2 was in her prime	16
33701	4755	It @CAPS22 @CAPS23 going to stop whatever we do	17
33702	4755	All we can do @CAPS22 block it out of our lives	18
33703	4755	We can try and keep it out of our childrens eyes but it will @CAPS23 help they will always be known to this world	19
33704	4755	I think we should move these things to another part of the library, that only adults can get to if that can be done in the library	20
33705	4755	Then we will move onto the music, and then the shows	21
33706	4755	Remember it will always be out there, all we can do as @CAPS20 @CAPS22 try to keep it out of reach of our children	22
33707	4755	We can't stop it but we can try and keep it out of there eyes	23
33708	4755	With the will power of @CAPS20 it CAN be done.FAILURE @CAPS22 @CAPS23 @CAPS24 @CAPS25!!!	24
33709	4756	Libraries @CAPS1 Or @CAPS2	0
33710	4756	This world is like no other world but to have some of our ideas blocked because there to offensive thats obsurd	1
33711	4756	There is a lot of things that are offensive in a library such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect..	2
33712	4756	But if they are so offensive to some people then why keep complaining do somthing about tell it someone	3
33713	4756	Now librarys are a place where people can relax and grab a @CAPS1 book to read it	4
33714	4756	When they stumble upon this book that is highly offensve why put it back	5
33715	4756	Say somehthing and tell the manager this book is too offensive to be in a library	6
33716	4756	There are kids in the library maybe looking for something to read they @MONTH1 stumble upon a movie that is very inpropriate	7
33717	4756	Things like that should not be in a public library	8
33718	4756	As a @CAPS3.S citizen i belive that things like that should be removed for the shevles	9
33719	4756	Why would they be up there in the first place what is this world coming to	10
33720	4756	Some of these books now and days need to be censored	11
33721	4756	Beacuse of all the @CAPS2 words in there kids might pick up all that foul language	12
33722	4756	How about some of this music don't you think some of the lyrics maybe be offensive to some people	13
33723	4756	When rock stars, rapers, ect..	14
33724	4756	write there lyrics they don't think of what other people think of them	15
33725	4756	They just might put the most badest languege in there songs they don't care they just want the money.Thats why you should put you're foot down and say this is going a little to far why not censor some of your lyrics	16
33726	4756	Why not write a letter sstating your concerns	17
33727	4756	Things in the librarys like books, movies, magazines, ect.	18
33728	4756	all should be checked and blacked out	19
33729	4756	Some of this shoudn't even be displayed in the librarys	20
33730	4756	There are children in the library now why would you go as far to put things like that in a public library	21
33731	4756	Lets take a magazine for example, a magazine has things that talk a lot about sex, drugs, and other things related to that	22
33732	4756	Some people might like it but for a twelve year old boy to pick up somthing like that and  start reading it	23
33733	4756	To me thats wrong i dont know about anyone else but that shouldn't be displayed in a library	24
33734	4756	Now ive been to a library before they have some inapropriate things in there	25
33735	4756	But i really didn't think anything of it but when i seen a eleven year old boy reading about drugs, sex, and violence that's something he might pick up on	26
33736	4756	He is seeing it in a book so why not try something in a book	27
33737	4756	Now and days this world has some shocking things in it but to put things like this in a library is horrible	28
33738	4756	This is all where censership comes into play by editing a lot of the things in the library	29
33739	4756	People now and days dont care but they shoud start caring more	30
33740	4756	Thats just my opinion why i think its wrong to put all this @CAPS2 stuff in a public liberary	31
33741	4756	I think this is something kids don't need to see what do you think	32
33742	4757	I believe that if that book, music, or magazines  that is offensive and people don't like it then maybe they should remove themself from the librarie	0
33743	4757	tThere are alot of things out there that people like to read and listen too	1
33744	4757	mmaybe for those people who do not like it they can go to an other librarie	2
33745	4757	There are alot of them around us	3
33746	4757	If a person did not like what they seen at that librarie then why go back	4
33747	4757	It could be offensive to some people but not all	5
33748	4757	So if people try to fight about removing them then the people that like them are going to be mad because they like to read it and they have a good time	6
33749	4757	Like i said before if they do not like it they then there are plenty more librarie's that probably will not have it there	7
33750	4757	Libraries should be able to put what they want on their shelfs	8
33751	4757	They could put in it in the back and whoever wants it and go ask for it	9
33752	4757	Or they could go put something up and make it where you know whats over there and if you do not like then do go in	10
33753	4757	There is more then just one shelf in a librarie, i you don't like it then don't go over there	11
33754	4757	If there is a sign up then there will be one reason for you to go over there and get all offended and complan about it	12
33755	4757	You got to think about other people in this too	13
33756	4757	Peolpe that do like it and go to the libraries to read books, listen ti music, rent a move, read magazines, they be able to do it anymore	14
33757	4757	Then they will be mad and then that just an other fight	15
33758	4757	Would anyone what that much drama, I wouldn't	16
33759	4757	That would be to much for me and hanle	17
33760	4757	People are  now these days	18
33761	4757	No one will know what i person would do if they don't get there book, music, movies, or magazines	19
33762	4757	How would you feel if you lost that	20
33763	4757	Probably not to happy	21
33764	4757	I believe that that books, music, movies, and magazines should stay on the shelfs of the librarie	22
33765	4757	Just becuse a few people don't like it and want to fight for it, should really sitt back and look at what they are doing	23
33766	4757	There are more then just one librarie in this world	24
33767	4757	If you don't like the stuff that librarie is putting on it's shelfs then go find a new one	25
33768	4757	It's not worth fighting over and spenting all that money on that not alot of people have these days just to fight about what is on a librarie shelf	26
33769	4757	Not even worth it	27
33770	4757	Like i said before you don't like it	28
33771	4757	don't look at it, read it	29
33772	4757	listen to it, nothing	30
33773	4757	Just stay away from it and you will not get offended.	31
33774	4758	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	0
33775	4758	No, I don't think so, these items should stay on the shelves for the appropriate ages	1
33776	4758	If you are over the age of eighteen you should be able to pick and chose to what ever topic they want	2
33777	4758	If you are under the age of eighteen there should be an age requirement and also require parent consent	3
33778	4758	For those under eighteen when they get a library membership they should have to verify thier date of birth, and what thier parent srequest their child to be able to read, play, or watch	4
33779	4758	Librarys and book stores should put a rating on the magazines or books, just like movies	5
33780	4758	This will promote less parents of anger for thier children listening to music or reading inappropriate books, magazines, or video games	6
33781	4758	Now if books stores sell these books to underage children without parent consent, there can be charges pressed	7
33782	4758	It would be pretty much the same thing as selling liquor, or cigarettes to a minor	8
33783	4758	From my observations with my little brother, my mother chose to let him play inappropriate video games	9
33784	4758	For instance these games consisted of violence, sex, drugs, and foul language	10
33785	4758	In result of this I notice that my brother does not obey, or treat my mother with the respect as he should	11
33786	4758	He also misbehaves in school constantly	12
33787	4758	That is just one example of the many I know of	13
33788	4758	Even if the parent gives permission for thier child to watch offensive movies, play inappropriate video games, or read certain books that are not suitable for his/her age, they should still have to be a certain age	14
33789	4758	Some parents make poor decisions on thier parenting, and it will reflect them later in life	15
33790	4758	So my overall opinion would be no	16
33791	4758	Keep the books on the shelf for the people that are mature enough to watch, read, or play	17
33792	4758	If they limit the selling of these items to minors, these children @DATE1 will not have as many crimes all together	18
33793	4758	There would be less violence, and drug offenses or abuse	19
33794	4758	Keep this all in mind	20
33795	4758	@ORGANIZATION1	21
33796	4759	Today in the media there are many things that can be found offensive	0
33797	4759	Movies, books, songs and magizines are a few examples of where someone might find something offensive	1
33798	4759	I believe that whatever is put into the media has a purpose	2
33799	4759	If someone thinks that something is offensive I think that they should just take what they find offensive away from themselves and not take it away from everyone else also	3
33800	4759	When a song artist comes up with a song there is a reason for why they put what they do in their songs	4
33801	4759	Sometimes they do it to get a point across to the audience	5
33802	4759	When someone finds a movie offensive there is a reason for why it is the way it is	6
33803	4759	it's to get a point across	7
33804	4759	If people find the movie offensive they just simply shouldn't subject themselves to it	8
33805	4759	If they don't watch the movie they won't have anything to be offended about	9
33806	4759	Certain books in libraries are found offensive to some people just because they don't agree with what is in them	10
33807	4759	If there is something in a book that you don't agree with you don't just take the book off the shelf and throw it away	11
33808	4759	Other people might injoy reading that book	12
33809	4759	If the book is thrown away no one will have the chance to read it besides the person who threw it away	13
33810	4759	I do not believe that media that is found offensive to some of the public shouyld be removed	14
33811	4759	Not everyone finds certain things offinsive in the media	15
33812	4759	Again, everything that is put onto the market and into the media has a purpose	16
33813	4759	it's purpose is to get a point across to others.	17
33814	4760	Certain books, magazines, music and movies should not be put on the shelves of a library	0
33815	4760	Children can learn rude or nasty things that their parents might not find alright for their child	1
33816	4760	There are some things that can be offensive in a library like prejudice books or music	2
33817	4760	Often music uses swearing language or states certain views on politics	3
33818	4760	Libraries need to take control of this issue the right way	4
33819	4760	Getting rid of the material is not what should be done	5
33820	4760	Libraries need to keep better watch over certain sections of the library	6
33821	4760	They could do this by not letting children leave their parents side	7
33822	4760	That way parents can know and control what their children are seeing	8
33823	4760	Then there is the issue of offending people	9
33824	4760	These problems could be resolved simply by putting up signs in different spots of the library	10
33825	4760	These sign could be in big bold letters stating 'Certain things in this section can be offending', '@CAPS1 control needed past this point'	11
33826	4760	Libraries should be more aware of how people feel about the way they are set up and presented to the public	12
33827	4760	Libraries should put them selves in the publics shoes, to see how they would like it if some of these things were showed to their children	13
33828	4760	Also, looking at things in a point of view of how some things could be offending, to fix the problems	14
33829	4760	Once when I was in a library I was offended by a book title that was against my religion	15
33830	4760	After seeing that I thought if their were a sign or something around to warn me I would not of had to see that	16
33831	4760	Other things like this have occured in a library like one time my brother rented a movie my parents did not approve of	17
33832	4760	But with the way the libraries are set up and controled my brother was able to rent the movie and sneak it past my parents	18
33833	4760	Other children like my brother could do the same things only worse like look at an inappropiate magazine or read certain books that parents would not approve	19
33834	4760	These types of occurances need to stop before something really bad happens	20
33835	4760	Libraries need to take control and show they know how to present things to the public in a proper manner	21
33836	4760	Actions that are happening in todays libraries are not alright	22
33837	4760	Putting up signs and requiring @CAPS1 control can reduce if not elliminate these unapproved occurances	23
33838	4761	Offensive things should be taken off for many reason that will be explained later on	0
33839	4761	Things in magazines shoud be appropriate for people to see	1
33840	4761	The first reason why they should be removed from the shelves is it might be offending to someone important like the president of the @ORGANIZATION1 or the @CAPS1 of your state	2
33841	4761	If the subjects in the reading material are offensive to someone they should say something to defend themselves	3
33842	4761	If they don't speak up no one will think to change anything	4
33843	4761	What I don't understand is why people would let that ridiculous stuff be put in the magazines and music and movies anyway.Even though movies are kind of different	5
33844	4761	Movies are mostly just made up ideas that people come up with	6
33845	4761	So if people are offended it is just pretend to begin with	7
33846	4761	Offending things in books well the author probably has a reason for it	8
33847	4761	It might be something that is offending yet people need to know this in case it has to do with someone you know.For example in the Newspaper I read an article about our current president	9
33848	4761	@PERSON1 was being question about his birth certificate	10
33849	4761	People did not believe that he was born in @LOCATION1	11
33850	4761	I personally think he was in fact born in the @CAPS2.S 	12
33851	4761	But of course they did see his certificate that proved he was a member so that mess should be dropped and forgotton	13
33852	4761	It was uncalled for to begin with	14
33853	4761	I wonder what was going through his head when someone asked him that question	15
33854	4761	I'm sure someone would have seen it before he even became president.	16
33855	4762	What if some one found your favorite book offensive	0
33856	4762	Inapporate materials do need to be kept from young minds of children.On the other hand, you can not sheild people from things they should know or already know	1
33857	4762	Everyone has different things that they think are offensive, so one person might think a book is so bad it should be recalled from the shelves but an another person @MONTH1 see no problem with it	2
33858	4762	Children need to be protected from materials that @MONTH1 hurt them in some way	3
33859	4762	Children do what they see and hear, so they are liable to try and cop harmful things they read 	4
33860	4762	Bad influences can be even magazines with famous celeberties being caught breaking the  law or doing bad things and young minds see that as 'cool' and @MONTH1 try to follow tha example	5
33861	4762	Children and young people see and hear a lot worse things at home, television and even at school than in some books	6
33862	4762	Children need to be protect but, you can't baby proof life	7
33863	4762	They willl be introduced to plenty of bad influnces in there life time but, it should be the parent's job to teach their kids to say no and stay away from bad things	8
33864	4762	Kids can learn so much worse things from something at the library by just setting at home	9
33865	4762	Libraries are places for use public and the public covers a wide amount of different kinds of people and someone will always find something bothersome with somting or another	10
33866	4762	People have different views, believes and religions, and, books on these might be offensive to some but, the life style of another	11
33867	4762	Like The  quote by Katherine Paterson, said if we take off the shelves every book or material that somone finds offensive there will be no books in the libraries at all	12
33868	4762	Yes, there are books that are not always very presentable to a certain group of people but, they should have a right to be read if their is someone who wants to read them	13
33869	4762	It is not the librarys job to be prejudice against certain books for because someone does't agree with it	14
33870	4762	Books should be a wide varitey like the people who are reading them	15
33871	4762	Also children are protect from books if they have learned morals that allow them to make mature choices	16
33872	4763	I blieve that any book or movie that is in the the library is in the library for a good reason	0
33873	4763	The world is full with things that will hurt and make a perosn feel bad about their self, and there is things in the world that will make you feel like you on top of the world	1
33874	4763	Yes, there is things that children can see and what they are not suppost to see, and those things are mostly likely  not expost to the student until they are at a muture and a responiable age	2
33875	4763	Life is full of things and as children grown up they are going to be teach, show things that parent thinks that is uncomfortable	3
33876	4763	Such as: Books that show people with disoders, a books about romance, movies with cussing and sex scenes in the movies, violence, some parnet don'@CAPS1 even want their children to see a simple kiss on the cheek	4
33877	4763	Which I find really weird because things like that are going to happen in life	5
33878	4763	On the other hand, if your child is doing things that they shouldn'@CAPS1 be doing then okay	6
33879	4763	Take acting	7
33880	4763	I also agree that a children @NUM1 shouldn'@CAPS1 be thought sex and show either what female have and what boys have on their body	8
33881	4763	Their mind shouldn'@CAPS1 even be set on that	9
33882	4763	Books, movies, @CAPS1.v shows shouldn'@CAPS1 be remove because they show what life is about and what is going to happen when you get older.	10
33883	4764	Debates are a main part of our society today	0
33884	4764	Everyone has an opinion on how things should be in the world, and no one is necessarily right	1
33885	4764	Books that show how other cultures behave, that to the people being described in the book @MONTH1 seem offensive, are important because we as people need to absorb as much as we can about other cultures	2
33886	4764	Our businesses are in other countries, many people living in @LOCATION1 speak multiple languages, and people have the right to read things that @MONTH1 in fact be offensive to a race of people	3
33887	4764	Businesses thrive in other countries	4
33888	4764	A lot of our countries income is from our factories and companies in other countries	5
33889	4764	@LOCATION2 is a place where much business happens for the @ORGANIZATION2	6
33890	4764	If we, as @CAPS1, can't learn about the @CAPS2, how can we learn their business methods and way of life	7
33891	4764	To the @CAPS2, these books @MONTH1 be offensive, but to us they are learning tools descirbing @CAPS2 culture	8
33892	4764	Being bilingual is a trend that millions of people adhere to	9
33893	4764	High schools require that we learn some foreign language, even if it is only the basics	10
33894	4764	The schools do this so that we can go to other countries in the work force	11
33895	4764	Learning about their language and habits comes from books	12
33896	4764	The mexican population might not like the way we depict them in our stories, but this is necessary to learn about them	13
33897	4764	In the @ORGANIZATION1, there are all kinds of freedoms that we as @CAPS1 use freely	14
33898	4764	Freedom of speech says that we can say whatever we want when we live in @LOCATION1	15
33899	4764	Books are not excluded from this rule	16
33900	4764	I'm sure that other countries have offensive books about us	17
33901	4764	It's a common theme around the globe	18
33902	4764	Businesses thrive in foreign countries, so we must be able to read some books about them, even if they seem offensive	19
33903	4764	Learning new things is something that every school teaches and there should be no limit to what we can learn	20
33904	4764	If a book has vulgar language and sexual scenes, it should be taken out of the children's section of the library, not banned completely	21
33905	4764	This is the same case with other populations of people	22
33906	4764	They cannot take offense to what we have to say, because worse has been said about them than what we can possibly put in a book	23
33907	4764	Learning is a necessary tool in our society and nothing should be restricted.	24
33908	4765	Books are very important to our society	0
33909	4765	They hold a special place in our hearts, and contain much of our world's knowledge	1
33910	4765	Everyone has their own opinion about what should or should not be placed in books	2
33911	4765	I definetly agree that little children should not purchase a book that has explicit content in it that they should not read	3
33912	4765	However, some people, myself included, have checked out or bought books and then realized what exactly was portrayed in those books	4
33913	4765	I do not believe that anything that contains certain contents should be removed from the shelves	5
33914	4765	I can think of many books that could be taken offensively that are still on many school library and public library shelves	6
33915	4765	Any books about the @CAPS1 and even the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, such as '@CAPS4 @CAPS5's @CAPS6' can be taken in the wrong context	7
33916	4765	These books do contain language that is not appropriate for children	8
33917	4765	But we do still see them on our shelves	9
33918	4765	Why	10
33919	4765	Because those books, and many others, are very important to us	11
33920	4765	Books should stay on their shelves because, as Katherine Paterson cleverly put it, '..	12
33921	4765	And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS7 means that if everyone took out books that they felt were personally offensive then there would be no books	13
33922	4765	Books are vital to learning things	14
33923	4765	We put all of our knowledge into them, even hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago	15
33924	4765	When the libraries in @LOCATION2 were burned and/or destroyed, we thought our knowledge was gone forever	16
33925	4765	Thank goodness for the back-up system that no one had known about out in the @LOCATION1	17
33926	4765	I myself have read the @ORGANIZATION1	18
33927	4765	I believe it whole-heartedly, but I do know of people who do not believe in the @CAPS8 and have taken some things that are said in the @ORGANIZATION1 to be taken personally	19
33928	4765	I believe that the @ORGANIZATION1 is the most important book in the world	20
33929	4765	Without the @ORGANIZATION1 no one would know of the wonderful things that our @CAPS8 above has done for us, and what he is doing for us now	21
33930	4765	However, some people can take what the @ORGANIZATION1 says to be offensive in regards to homosexuals and divorces	22
33931	4765	But would we allow the gays or divorced men and women to take the @ORGANIZATION1 off of the shelves	23
33932	4765	Of course not!If we would not allow them to take off that ever so important book, then why should we allow to have other books to be removed	24
33933	4765	Books are so very important to us and our world	25
33934	4765	They hold our world's knowledge, and they also hold our hearts	26
33935	4765	Just think about what our world, our knowledge, our society would be like if we did not have these precious things	27
33936	4765	Can you imagine it	28
33937	4765	I cannot	29
33938	4765	Books are one of the most important things that we have in @CAPS7 world	30
33939	4765	Just because someone finds something offensive in a written work does not mean that everyone else will, too	31
33940	4765	Books, if they are offensive to anyone, should be kept on our shelves for our future generations to come so they @MONTH1 learn and grow on our knowledge of our past	32
33941	4766	In todays world, children are exposed to a lot of inappropriate things than in recent times	0
33942	4766	They hear things from older siblings, see uncensored programs on television, hear words in music, and even learn things from books	1
33943	4766	An issue at hand is whether or not libraries should or should not dispose of inappropriate books, movies, music, and magazines	2
33944	4766	Children can read whatever they like if their parents give permission, but in today's society some parents do not take the time to care, consumed in their work	3
33945	4766	One way society can take care of this problem is setting age limits on books	4
33946	4766	There have been times when my mother will not allow me to read a book because it dealt with issues that I was not ready to learn about	5
33947	4766	Although I am lucky that my mother cares about what I read, some parents are not	6
33948	4766	This is why an age limit would be helpful in keeping our youth modest	7
33949	4766	The librarians, or a national book association, could decide if the content of a book is appropriate for a certain age	8
33950	4766	This would take care of children reading about bawdy issues that they should not know about	9
33951	4766	Also, @CAPS1 books should be more readily available	10
33952	4766	These types of books teach good morals and how to live a good and full life	11
33953	4766	In schools across the country, many @CAPS1 authors are not in the public school libraries	12
33954	4766	By putting these types of books into the libraries, students would be more aware of them and would most likely have an interest in them, learning from them	13
33955	4766	Another issue libraries have is music and movies	14
33956	4766	It is nice to be able to go to the library and check out a cd or even a movie	15
33957	4766	But, some of these have terrible language and scenes not appropriate for children	16
33958	4766	What can the general public do about this	17
33959	4766	Well, demand that all music and videos with content not generalized for children be removed from the libraries	18
33960	4766	This would keep children from seeing and hearing actions they should not copy	19
33961	4766	There are ratings on movies for a reason, so why not use them	20
33962	4766	Anything above @NUM1 should be a definent no in libraries	21
33963	4766	If the movie has content that any child under thirteen should not see, then the movie should be out	22
33964	4766	Magazines also offer a source of learning	23
33965	4766	Some are very educational, and give the students ideas to go and come up with a new invention or a way to help others	24
33966	4766	But, some have content that are not suited for children	25
33967	4766	Thus, like the books, the magazines should also have ratings	26
33968	4766	The magazine @CAPS3, for example, has articles that are to bawdy for students to read	27
33969	4766	Magazines like this should be put in an adult section where students cannot look at them	28
33970	4766	Magazines also offer pictures that, in recent times, would have been illegal to put out	29
33971	4766	But, in today's standards, they are fine to put in magazines	30
33972	4766	These magazines should not even be allowed in the libraries across our nation	31
33973	4766	America's standards on what is okay to read, look at, watch, and listen to have changed drastically	32
33974	4766	Children are learning things they should not know about, until an older age, at a very young age	33
33975	4766	Society need to put strict restrictions on what is right and what is not for children	34
33976	4766	I personally believe that there should be very strict restrictions on what children are allowed to watch, read, and listen to	35
33977	4766	My parents were very strict about this and, in the end, I feel this has benefitted my learning process	36
33978	4766	Also, I feel the libraries should rid of books that, in olden times, would have been a shame to read	37
33979	4766	Parents today are not as in sync with what their children do as they were in recent years	38
33980	4766	So, society needs to put a strict rule on what libraries carry and what they do not.	39
33981	4767	This is going to be an essay about if people finding somthing offensive in a library or in music that it should be censored	0
33982	4767	It is also about if you think it should be taken off the shelves because some people find it offinsive	1
33983	4767	The way I look or my own oppinion is that they should censore most things from libraries and music,but not get rid of it because one person finds it offensive	2
33984	4767	If you think about it thoses uncensered material like books that some people fnd offinsive might be a fit book for someone else to what they can relate to as they were growing up	3
33985	4767	On the other hand they should be more carful about it so when younger kids listen to the radio or are reading a book they dont get the wrong ideas	4
33986	4767	We should censor things but only with an extent and not go over board with it	5
33987	4767	In the long run it might help with a more clean and safe population because were are censoring things to wear people dont hear bad and only hear the good in life	6
33988	4767	You never know you could make a big differance by doing that	7
33989	4767	The reason i wouldnt go out and censor everthing is because you cant stop everone from doing it	8
33990	4767	You can always give it a try but thats one of the main reasons why i wouldnt try and get rid of it cause a sertan person might find it offensive	9
33991	4767	I ncan understand if you took it off there self that someone found offinse but only move it to wear no one will find it offensive	10
33992	4767	Im not saying its wrong to do that but i think it could and probably would make alot of people angry	11
33993	4767	But hey what can i say what has the government done that we dont like or cant do anything about it	12
33994	4767	And thats all i have to say about that.	13
33995	4768	Books, movies, magazines, music, etc., make up a huge part of our entertainment system in our lives today	0
33996	4768	Whether it be informational or just purely for entertainment, many forms of entertainment are found in your local library today, whereas in the past most libraries only contained books	1
33997	4768	Although, our entertainment today is much different then it was back then and will be much different than it will be in the future	2
33998	4768	In today's society books, magazines, music, movies, and so on can be found in your local library, and contain many different types of material	3
33999	4768	Some material could be informational about our solar system or about the human body	4
34000	4768	Other material could be a fiction story filled with action, horror, or love	5
34001	4768	Some material could also be filled with true, life changing, and inspritaional storries	6
34002	4768	Which ever it @MONTH1 be, these types of things @MONTH1 come off as offensive to some people more than others and @MONTH1 not be apporpriate for younger ages	7
34003	4768	Certain books, movies, magaizines, music, ect., containing offensive, inappropriate, or rude material shouldn't be banned from libraries, just because those younger than adults should not read them, or becuase those who dislike the material believe that that material does not belong in the library	8
34004	4768	Generally most libraries are quite large and organized into various sections throughout the building	9
34005	4768	One area might be for fiction books and another for non-fiction books, another area could be for childrens books, and another for magazines, movies, music, ect., all based on different types and genres	10
34006	4768	Simply do this for those materials that should only be read by adults and not for children or teens	11
34007	4768	Take the books that @MONTH1 contain offensive material, or @MONTH1 be inappropriate for those younger than adults and place them in their own divided section in the library	12
34008	4768	When a book from that section is being checked out merely ask for an @CAPS1 from the person checking that book out to make sure that they are of age	13
34009	4768	This can also apply to movies, magazines, music, and so on that are placed in that section	14
34010	4768	Some materials found in libraries that @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to others	15
34011	4768	Taking those offensive materials out of the library won't benefit everyone and @MONTH1 disappoint some of the people who don't find that material offensive	16
34012	4768	Placing these certain materials in their own section is the best way to go to benefit everyone	17
34013	4768	As you can see just because one person @MONTH1 find certain material in magazines, books, music, movies, ect., offensive, rude, or inappropriate, doesn't mean that everyone else does	18
34014	4768	It also doesn't mean you should completely take out and get rid of all the materials that are found to contain offensive or innapropraite material	19
34015	4768	Dividing those specific materials into their own section, and regulating who @MONTH1 check them out is really the best way to go	20
34016	4768	It benefits everyone at best so that those who want to read that material can still go to their library and check out that book, magazine, and so on, and those who wish to not have anything to do with that certain material don't have to worry about finding material that is offensive or inappropriate, because they will be in their own divided section	21
34017	4769	I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves due to censorship.Different sections in the libary should be offerd.Everyone has differnt oppions on what they like to read or watch.You should do what you want at your own risk.I think the censorship should not affect the libary	0
34018	4769	The libary should offer differnt sections, therefore a kids side, a teenage side, and an adult side	1
34019	4769	The kids side should offer books that only kids should see by age group.The kids should not have to worry about censorship becuase they should not be offered any thing that an libarian would not want them to see and they should only be able to checkout things from their side of the libary	2
34020	4769	A teen side should not have censorship because alot of kids know many things that they should not so it would not effect them as much.Books that teengers read are most likely to have foul language and inapropiate things	3
34021	4769	Teenagers when they read or see things does not really influenece them as much	4
34022	4769	Music that teenagers listen to they already know what most of the songs are talking about so why offer only censored music at libraries	5
34023	4769	Why would you want to try to remove something when it is already known	6
34024	4769	An adult side should not have censorship, adults should be able to read, watch, and look at mostly anything.Adults are the ones who see it and heard it all	7
34025	4769	It would be pointless to get rid of things on the sheleves.	8
34026	4769	They already know of allot of things	9
34027	4769	Why get rid of books that others @MONTH1 read	10
34028	4769	It is a libary so it should just offer things that would increase intellegence not decrease it	11
34029	4769	The censorship is pointless, you should do what you want at your own risk.Things in movies,books,magazines are that are of the world	12
34030	4769	Why try to block out negative things when there all around you	13
34031	4769	If someone finds something affensive then let it be there are many things affensive in today's society.You pick up what you want to read and make the choice on your own	14
34032	4769	If your capable of reading it or if it is the right decision check it out.You enter the libary at your own risk and choose what criteria or selection your going to choose	15
34033	4769	The libary is full of differnt oppions and allot of differnt likes and dislikes.If you should not be looking at something then it is your oppion to take what you want out of it	16
34034	4769	Everyone enjoys differnt things like, movies,books, magazines, and music	17
34035	4769	If the libary had a censorship they would loose allot of matrials all due to oppions of people that did not care about others oppions.Everyone enjoys differnt things and wants a wide varitey of the things they like	18
34036	4769	The libary is where you go when you need  books, movies, and etc	19
34037	4769	Why close someones oppion of  book selections, what if that is the only type of selection, or book they like to read	20
34038	4769	I believe that the censorship should not affect the libary.The libary should offer differnt sections  for certain age groups.The books and magazinges and music at the libary should all be at your own risk to checkout them	21
34039	4769	Everyone has differnt oppions at the libary	22
34040	4769	The censorship would be a bad decison if they did go through with this decison.	23
34041	4769	The libary would not offer as many things and most liekly less things would be getting checkedout	24
34042	4769	Therefore I do think that the cenosorship should not remove books on the shelves at libraries	25
34043	4770	I personally think certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.	0
34044	4770	should not have to be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive	1
34045	4770	First of all how do we define offensive	2
34046	4770	Is it something that discrimnates a certain group of people	3
34047	4770	Is it something that creates negative attention	4
34048	4770	Is it something we don't like	5
34049	4770	Anybody can walk in a library and find something they did not like, but that does not automatically mean it is offensive	6
34050	4770	The national geographic magazine often has pictures of naked people and so does the @CAPS1 magazine	7
34051	4770	So which one would we have to put censorship on	8
34052	4770	The answer is we don't put one because this would start a big arguement of which is offensive and which is not.It would cause a conflict of two different sides	9
34053	4770	It is only offensive when we make it offensive	10
34054	4770	We do not have to look at something we don't like.We all have a choice and we can choose not to pick up something we might think is offensive	11
34055	4770	The @ORGANIZATION1 @MONTH1 not get along with the @CAPS2 but if both were in a library together with both of their holy books on the shelves, they cannot say one's book is offensive to another because it does not agree with theirs	12
34056	4770	We sometimes forget we have the ammendment that allows us to the freedom of speech and press	13
34057	4770	We @MONTH1 not like what one person publishes but it doesn't make their work offensive because it might be for a certain of group that likes it, which is not offensive to them.Everything in the library has a purpose and if it does not fit our purpose then there is no way it woud be offensive to us	14
34058	4770	The library is a place for books, music, movies, magazines, etc..We come to the library to check out books for a research in order to learn	15
34059	4770	We also go to the library to read the newest book of a series	16
34060	4770	Putting a censorship on these things would not enable us to do these	17
34061	4770	We can't finish our research project because someone thought one book was offensive or we can't listen to new album @CAPS3.Dre released because some people think the lyrics are too offensive	18
34062	4770	Putting a censorship would upset the general public more than not having a censorship because if everyone can check out what they want from the library then everyone is content	19
34063	4771	We all hope that one day our children will not pick up a book or a magazine their not suppose to read	0
34064	4771	Children don't know any better	1
34065	4771	But why should we have to have movies, books and etc censored, cause their little children every where	2
34066	4771	If i had the right to keep the books and etc on the shelf i would	3
34067	4771	I think that we should be able to have books that are uncensored on the shelfs	4
34068	4771	If everything was censored we would really have nothing to read or to watch	5
34069	4771	Having everything censored thats just not fair to the world	6
34070	4771	Everyone should be able to watch what ever they want with out it having to be censored	7
34071	4771	If people favorite movies or music was censored it probably wouldnt be that funny to them anymore, they'll most likely just stop watching it	8
34072	4771	I don't believe that they should have a censorship in libraries	9
34073	4771	Certain materials in like cd's songs do come off little offensive sometimes, but that's just life	10
34074	4771	If you think it's offensive then just don't listen to it	11
34075	4771	That doesnt mean that they have to take it off the shelf	12
34076	4771	Maybe other people like that kind of music or etc	13
34077	4771	That doesnt mean they have a right just to take it off cause of that	14
34078	4771	If they did that's just really unfair	15
34079	4771	Children now days see more and know more what they are not suppose to know, for an example cursing	16
34080	4771	If a child happen to see cursing in a magazine at the library and their parents got mad that was in the magazine	17
34081	4771	The parent shouldnt really be mad and take that offensive, and think that not suppose to be in their	18
34082	4771	The library shouldn't have to censor thing's cause of that incident	19
34083	4771	The children will hear it or see it again soon or later	20
34084	4771	I would keep the right for the libraires to have things uncensored, if i had the decision	21
34085	4771	Those are some ideas why i think they shouldnt have to censor movies, music etc in the library.	22
34086	4772	Libraries have a variety of material from books to movies	0
34087	4772	Most of this is intended for a general audience and many people can read or watch whatever they want	1
34088	4772	Some of the literature and other material you @MONTH1 find in libraries however, are not intended for certain people, such as young children	2
34089	4772	Censorship takes material that these certian people should not read away from everyone	3
34090	4772	Many people want censorship not just in libraries but in many aspects of life	4
34091	4772	Censorship is not bad per say but it does restrict people, who would normally have access to a certain topic, to a general catigory	5
34092	4772	Not everyone likes to read the same thing as someone else	6
34093	4772	Other then likes and dislikes is the problem of offensiveness	7
34094	4772	Everyone finds something offensive	8
34095	4772	Just because you find something that speaks a bold statement does not mean that you should persicute someone who is intersested in the subject matter	9
34096	4772	For the matter of protecting children against something they should not read yet is simple	10
34097	4772	Libraries often have dedicated children's sections where children @MONTH1 choose material approprate for their age range	11
34098	4772	More often then not I enjoy reading what I enjoy far more than something that is forced	12
34099	4772	Censorship takes away from the enjoyment of reading	13
34100	4772	By not having censorship, everyone will be happy in the fact that they get to read what they like	14
34101	4772	This also allows a variety of books to a variety of people	15
34102	4773	The author is writting about taking books off that the adult's don't want the book's the  end they won't have book's to	0
34103	4773	They take out the books that have bad words or pictures in them	1
34104	4773	Well I don't really belive that they should take them out becuase they het intresting well some of them do	2
34105	4773	Well I'm not a fan of reading I dont really like reading but I have to anyway and I dont think it should be taking out	3
34106	4773	I don't really think it should be taken out for some reasons it's better to have them so kids can read and learn bout the pictures	4
34107	4773	Some book's aren't that bad to kid's like to elementary kid's the only book's they like are the one's with picture's in them	5
34108	4773	The @CAPS1 school and middle school kid's like the chapter kind of book's and intresting book's	6
34109	4773	The parent's would like them to have educational book's that will help the kid's learn new word's and school related stuff	7
34110	4773	The book's the adult's want are the kind that have meaning to like have alot of knowledge and school realated stuff	8
34111	4773	They want there kid's to learn about what they are reading	9
34112	4773	But yea i din't think they should take out the bbok's that they have they shoul'd just leave them for the kid's becuase there atleast are educational to them	10
34113	4773	So the adult's would have more educational student's to relly on	11
34114	4774	I do not think that materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removes from shelves if they are found offensive	0
34115	4774	I think this because people have different views and belifts on certains types of things, with reglion, culture, and sexaually	1
34116	4774	Some people can be defend by it but other might can be inform and learn new facts that they didn't already know	2
34117	4774	People are not going to look at things the same	3
34118	4774	Eveyone has their own way of life and think differently	4
34119	4774	If one person feel the book was offensive to them then they would take it off the shelves	5
34120	4774	One by one people would find other materials offenive and what does it leave us	6
34121	4774	No more books, music, movies, and magazines	7
34122	4774	Let face it everyone have different belifts, values, and purpose but taking a materials off the shelves because they found it offensive is ridulous to me	8
34123	4774	I say if they find it offensive don't read the book again or the magazine again	9
34124	4774	Feel offensive over a movie don't watch it again and the same as music don't listen to it again	10
34125	4774	Easy as that	11
34126	4774	Materials give us resources and we learn new things	12
34127	4774	If we didn't have materials like books, music, movies, and magazines we wouldn't be as smart as we is @CAPS1 are	13
34128	4774	American is about being free and have rhe right to speak our mind	14
34129	4774	So putting materials off of shelves is not the answer	15
34130	4776	I do believe that  book, magazines, music, movies and etc., should be taken off a shelf if a person wants to read the book or magazine	0
34131	4776	If another person wants to read the book or magazine they would just have to wait until the book or magazine is returned to the shelf	1
34132	4776	If another person wants to listen to music or watch a movie they should also do the same	2
34133	4776	Sometimes you just have to sit and think what is books, magazines, movies, music and etc., for and why are they on the shelves for if you can't read, listen or watch them	3
34134	4776	Book and magazine should be read and not just sit and be displayed	4
34135	4776	Music should be listen to and movies should be watched	5
34136	4776	The reason why I agree with the fact magazines and book should be taking off the shelf  is  because they were made to enterain you	6
34137	4776	A book or magazine is also made to catch the reader attention	7
34138	4776	Another reason why I  think books or magazines should be removed from a shelf is to learn new thing	8
34139	4776	An example of learning new things is when you go to school you pick up the classrooom book you  learn different thing like math, you learn about the history, or you learn about different  thing in english class	9
34140	4776	Magazines and books were made so that  different people can  take it off a shelf  and look though it even if they only want to look a pictures if it has picture	10
34141	4776	The reason why I think music should be taking off the shelf is to listen to different music such as rap, @CAPS1&@CAPS2, gospel,or @CAPS1&@CAPS2 and soul	11
34142	4776	Also, I think music should be removed from the shelf is because it was meant to heard	12
34143	4776	Some music can teach you what goes on in a person life or what goes on in their heads.Music can inspire people in different ways.Music is apart of life and most people in the world like to listen it different people that inspir them	13
34144	4776	The reason why I think movies should be taking off the shelf is because it is meant to be watched not just sit and let in movie cover entertain the people	14
34145	4776	Movies can also inspire different people to do different thing, such as become an actor also	15
34146	4776	Movies tell different stories such as life stories	16
34147	4776	Movies also give people something to do when they are bored	17
34148	4776	To conclude this all up, take movies, magazines, books and music off the but put them back so that other people can enjoy they thing you read, watched, or listened to	18
34149	4776	Watching movies and listening to music nad reading magazines and books can help people in life and @MONTH1 also inspire people	19
34150	4776	They were made for very good reasons so don't put them up just to be displayed	20
34151	4776	Take them and use them for good you want regret it in the long run	21
34152	4776	Ya'll be suprised what different things you can learn by reading, listening and watching.	22
